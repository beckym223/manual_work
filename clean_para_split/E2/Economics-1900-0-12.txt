to call repl-esentatives of different parts of the people
together for the autlloritative presetltation of popular
OpilliO. At the close of the last century, wlaell other
countries adopted institutions modeled on the Eaglish
Parliamellt, it was illtellded that they should preserve
this salne fullction as del:)ating bodies; and the most
glorious pag-es in the history of the United States Congress,
are those in which public opinion was formed and
