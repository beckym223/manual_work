It seems to llle that it would be just as reasonable to
expect the average young man to select the subjects
without assistance which would be of special value to
him as eolnmercial training frotn a list of a thousand
elective courses, as it would be to expeet the young mall
looking forward to law to select in the same xvay the
subjects which would be of most advantage to him, if
these letal subjects xvere thrown into a pot along with
the rest. I believe that it is the duty of the university,

yoll tell the boy who has a notion that he woulel like to
be a physieiall, that the university orfers the ehallee to
learn how to beeome a physieiall, and if you tell the
boy \07:o would like to be a better fal-luer, that the university
offers faeilities for aequiring that added infomlation
and experienee he would like to have, the notion
beeomes definitely eoncrete to him, and he looks forward
with pleasure and zest to the idea of attending sueh an
institution. When yotl say to the boy who is going into
