corporatiolls. I would develop, in a word, so far as
possible the practical as well as the theoretical sides of
insurance, banking and similar departments of industry.
I Snd, alnong others, the foliowillg sul:jects alreacly
offered in the curricula establislled in these new departnellts:
economic geography, history of coml-nerce, business
organization and managemellt, commercial law,
transpol-tatioll, money and banking, ulaterials of commerce,
contracts, personal property, tlleol-y of accounts,
aucliting, illsurance, statistics, corporation finallce.
I need not here go into ally further detail; I desire
oally to emphasize the fact that in my opinion any curriculum
for higher collllllercial education wllicll does
ot give reasollable attelltiol-l to what might be called
the practical aspects of business life will not accomplish
the best results.

I alll not only in favor of the universities undertalillg
this fllllctioll of proviclillg lligl1er edllcation for business
rnell, bllt I alll in favor of plltti21g these elelllents into
such a sllape that a rollllg lllall can feel that he is following
Ollt a s;57stel-Ilatic course of study wllile plll-SUillg
it. I believe also that the university should allllounce
in a defillite forul that it proposes to offer a cllrriculum
for the benefit of those lnen expectiIlg to go into business,
exactly as it allllollllces tl1at it l1as a laxv scl1ool
or a meclical scl1ool. I make this statelllellt because
sorlle of our ulliversities, which have ilg the xvide range
of their elective studies a g,reat lnally of these eleluents
svl1icll I have l-llentiolaed, refuse to regard it as clesirable
to acld the other subjects which I have suagested, or
to call attention to the fact that they ofier facilities which
would be worth the while of oung rnen to take ad-
07alltage of, before elltering upon their active business
liv es.
