Figure 2. Responses to Unit g Shock
the top of the column. Note that the 1-year debt case with uj = 10 is about halfway
between the pure real debt case of Barro (1979) and the flex-price case. The consol
case is very close to the flex-price case for the time paths of the real variables b and
r, though its time path for inflation and interest rates is quite different.
The point of this comparison is not to claim that a combination of long debt and
low response of taxes to fiscal shocks is optimal. The model is extremely stylized,
and the costs of inflation have been calibrated only to a value that makes contrasts
between cases easy to see. As is by now well understood, the first-order accurate
solution obtained as here by local linearization does not allow us directly to com
pute expected welfare, even for the stylized objective function. Since both taxes
and inflation vary much less in the consol solution, it seems likely that it delivers
higher welfare, but because the budget constraint is nonlinear, we can't be certain of
this. The amount of shock absorption available from surprise changes in prices and
interest rates depends on the size of the real debt, and the real debt is locally non
stationary in this solution.
However, the results with long and short debt contrast so sharply that this example
does provide a reason for caution in interpreting the results of analyses like those
of Schmitt-Groh√© and Uribe (2001) and Siu (2004). These papers conclude that
in normal (non-war) times, it is optimal to make very little use of surprise inflation
in cushioning fiscal shocks, but both papers assume that all debt is one-period debt.
It is likely that their conclusions are sensitive to this assumption.
