found to-day among business men in their dealings with
one another and with the public, I wish to make it clear
at the outset that my purpose, primarily, is not to defend
nor to condemn either men or practices, but, as best I can,
to understand. Furthermore, it is not necessary for my
purpose to raise the question of the philosophic basis of
morals. Interesting as that question always is, its discussion
is profitless from the viewpoint of practical civic
improvement.

In spite of the pessimistic tone of many of our popular
writers, it is certain that, in most fields of endeavor,
society is improving in its methods and in its purposes.
Why not in business methods and business aims? At
no other time in the world's history has there been so
kind and intelligent a treatment of the poor and the defective;
at no other time have men been so humane in
their treatment of animals and in their dealings with their
fellowmen in the event of war or of great misfortune; at
no other time have deeds of courtesy and acts of mercy
been so numerous as now. The fact that within the last
few years so many influential business men, not only in
the United States, but also in other countries, have engaged


### ---Economics-1907-0-02.txt---
in operations that have shocked the sense of justice
and honor and fair-dealing, seems out of harmony with
the general trend of social events. It was certainly not
to be expected that men who seem entirely conscientious
in all their dealings, public and private, men who apparently
in all private relations lead exemplary lives, men
who have won universal respect, should suddenly in their
business be found engaged in acts illegal and dishonorable.
JIn explanation there seems only one alternative:
either our standard of business integrity has changed; or
we have found difficulty in applying our former standards
to modern conditions.
Doubtless within the last decade in business positions
of importance weak men have been found who have
yielded to temptation. But many acts condemned by
public opinion have been committed by men who are not
weak and who apparently have had no sense of guilt.
The fact that there are weak or wicked men in business,
while true, is not sufficient as an explanation.
We are all creatures of custom; we generally drift
under the inertia of habit in thought as well as in action.
In consequence, changes in social or business conditions
take us unawares; we need time to readjust ourselves.
Meanwhile we do foolish and wrong things. The old ways
do not fit the new surroundings. Consider, for example,
the blind despair of the cotton weavers in England, when,
early in the last century, the power loom displaced the
hand loom, and thousands were thrown out of employment.
They did not understand; they could not foresee
the inevitable; and, in their foolish rage, they smashed
the machines. But they were no more foolish than are
many men of the present day who hope and expect to see
the business of railways and gas companies, natural monopolies,
regulated by competition. This mental or social


### ---Economics-1907-0-03.txt---
inertia, which prevents us at times from seeing the meaning
of social conditions, has, to be sure, a conservative
power that is often beneficial; but it has also its evil side,
and it affords a partial explanation of many acts which
we are inclined to condemn as wrong. This is a social
fact never to be ignored. How does it fit our problem?
What are the new conditions of business which may
affect our standards of honor? Four characteristics of
modern business have an important bearing upon this
problem:

i) Business is done on a vastly larger scale than ever
before.

2) The modern business man does not come into personal
contact with his workingmen, his customers, or the
consumers of his products, as did his predecessor of half
a century ago.

3) The directors and officers of our great corporations
are now trustees for thousands of stockholders;
earlier the corporations did not exist, and there was no
such trusteeship.

4) Large profits from monopolies that are legal,
but sometimes economically and socially unjustifiable,
are more frequent now than earlier.
These facts demand thoughtful consideration. When
two or three grocers or butchers in a country village formally,
or informally, agree to maintain prices, the transaction
is not materially different in nature from that of an
agreement between different members of a beef-trust, or
from the so-called "gentlemen's agreement" to maintain
rates on our railways. But, in the first instance, while
a few customers have their private opinions about the
meanness of their neighbors and fellow-church-members,
no one feels that a serious wrong has been committed,
altho in that locality a monopoly has been produced;


### ---Economics-1907-0-04.txt---
whereas in the case of the Trust, properly enough, there
is world-wide condemnation. Are the cases different in
nature or only in degree? In the one, a village is the
victim of monopoly; in the other, a nation. In the one
case, the monopolist is a petty tyrant to be despised; in
the other, a monster to be feared. Such different effects
are produced on our feelings merely by an increase in
the scale of operations.
Results no less striking are produced by lack of personal
association. Dr. George P. Watkins, in a paper
as yet unpublished, has properly laid great emphasis upon
the well-known fact that the wealth of the rich is held
to-day so largely in the form of stocks and bonds that the
owner has little personal touch either with the property
which his securities represent or with its management.
He knows that he has so many thousands or hundreds
of thousands of dollars invested in this railway
or that corporation, but so long as he draws his
dividends promptly, he is often content not to know
more. Until the middle of the last century the situation
was vastly different. The wealthy man managed
his wealth himself; he saw with his own eyes
the work, the home-life, the personal conditions of his
workmen. As a merchant or as a manufacturer, he dealt
personally with his customers and price-fixing might well
be a matter of personal discussion. The transaction often
assumed the nature of gift or favor, on the one side; on
the other, that of personal appeal. When dealings are
on a small scale, discriminations between persons are
often not only not injurious to society, they are highly
commendable. When, however, the articles purchased
or the services bought are not for immediate consumption
but for further production; when the effect of the
discrimination, instead of ending with the personal benefit


### ---Economics-1907-0-05.txt---
of one individual or of a small group of individuals,
involves the wealth or ruin of rival establishments employing
thousands of laborers, the discrimination becomes
a public danger. The driver of a stagecoach
may if he will, give a lift to a weary traveler
or to a personal friend. When the local magnate
whose freight is half of all the freight hauled
by the coach asks a favor, it will be granted; and few
people are harmed thereby. When, however, a railroad
corporation, bullied by threats of injury to business,
grants a favor to a great manufacturer, this favor may
mean a monopoly that will take millions from the people.
(We may properly note as a fact that rebates by railroad
companies or special favors by the manager of a great
corporation have, relatively speaking, been very rarely
given to personal friends for personal reasons, tho personal
favors were common in the small transactions of
an earlier generation; but rebates have often been extorted
by great establishments, and often freely granted
by railroads to secure large shipments.) But in any
event, while we should all approve the generous action of
the stage-driver, we all, rightly, condemn the railroad.
The railroad is a common carrier, a creature of the public.
It is, however, easy to see that a business man, whether
cordial and kindly or eager and grasping, when working
for the extension of his trade, may not take time to follow
thru all their intricacies, the manifold baleful effects
of his acts of discrimination. He sees his own benefit;
he overlooks the public injury.
And this principle is everywhere active.. It is alive
in our human nature. The removal from personal contact
with their laborers, with their customers, and with
the consumers of their products, takes from business men
the sense of the cruelty and meanness which their acts


### ---Economics-1907-0-06.txt---
would sometime be seen to have, if the consequences
were immediate and personal. Nearness, personal touch,
is an active force. Many a ruler has signed the deathwarrant
of a criminal whom he has never seen, an account
of whose guilt he has been willing to take from others
with little investigation, when he would have hesitated
long 4nd investigated much more thoroly, had he been
compelled himself to be the hangman. Many a ruler,
who, in upholding the so-called honor of his country or
of his dynasty, has sent thousands of men to torture and
death, would have found other ways of satisfying the
demands of honor, or might even have revised his views
of the nature of honor, had he been compelled himself
to lead his columns into battle, himself to see the carnage,
or to take the risk of personal suffering. In similar ways
our great business leaders, who are kindly in personal
disposition, who take warm delight in relieving suffering,
whose word in business transactions is as good as a bond,
whose private life is touched by no breath of scandal,
will, at times, with comparatively little investigation, because
the books show a falling off in profits, order a cutting
of wages, or a slaughter of prices, or a raid on the
market. In taking these precautionary or profitable
measures, they feel that they are doing praiseworthy acts,
and have little or no thought of the sacrifice of public interest
thereby entailed, or of the thousands of people to
whom they may bring suffering.
Again, the director of a great corporation, or its manager,
feels it his first interest and his most obvious duty
to care for the welfare of the stockholders for whom he
is trustee. The fact that he is himself a stockholder
merely stiffens this mental attitude. The fact that his
own position is dependent upon his so managing the business
as to secure good dividends for his stockholders,


### ---Economics-1907-0-07.txt---
sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, tends
to blind his eyes to the social results of many of his acts.
When, then, the question comes to a director, or to the
president of a corporation, whether he shall observe the
law, (which may even, at times, seem to him unjust), at the
expense of sacrificing the dividends of thousands of stockholders
for whom he is a trustee, and perhaps incidentally
of sacrificing his own position if he fails to earn these
dividends, even tho he knows that the violation of the
law may injure some people to him personally unknown,
it is natural that he should feel the pressure of his
trusteeship for his stockholders more strongly than the
pressure of his trusteeship for the public. He does
wrong. I am not excusing him. I am trying to understand
him; to see how a man who is upright and honorable
in most matters does wrong in business.
I have had important shippers say to me that they not
merely disliked to receive rebates contrary to law, but
that they would use their every effort to secure a law which
would prevent the granting and the acceptance of rebates.
But when, from current prices, they saw that one of their
rivals was receiving a certain rebate, and that unless they
secured a like concession, they would be forced out of
business, was it to be expected that they would hesitate?
Without the rebate, the interests of their stockholders
and their own personal interests would be sacrificed.
With it, tho contrary to law, they and their rivals would
be placed on an equal footing. Their interests enable
them to see their stockholders near at hand; the public
seems dim in the distance. Let us try to be fair. It may
be that we are partly to blame. If our laws are unjust,
we must share the guilt.
The manager of the great corporation may often give
other reasons for his acts that sound very interesting.


### ---Economics-1907-0-08.txt---
With the welfare of many thousands of stockholders in
his hands, he says, he finds himself situated in many respects
as is the ruler of a small state, entrusted with the
welfare of his people. But it has been held by many
writers, to say nothing of practical statesmen, that instances
not seldom occur where a ruler must sacrifice the
ordinary principles of morals as applied to private life,
in order, to follow what he considers the "higher law" of
caring for the welfare of his people. Ought we to do
evil, from the private viewpoint, to secure the public
good? This question of political ethics is touched later.
But, to make clear the point, I may perhaps venture to
quote from one of the great writers on politics and morals,
Gustav Ruemelin, late Chancellor of the University
of Tfibingen, a few words which seem to be approved by
one of our own late distinguished publicists, Frederick
W. Holls:

"A man,". he says, "should be magnanimous and generous
only at his own expense, not at the expense of
others. Wherever force is permissible strategy cannot
be debarred. Where it is allowable to take life [as for
example in war] it cannot be improper merely to deceive,
and in case the same result could be obtained by either
method, deception is preferable, as being the more
humane and indulgent....
.... It would be folly in war for one of the combatants
to renounce the right to make use of spies among
the subjects of the hostile state by means of corruption.
The conditions in which the higher interests of a state or
a nation are at stake transcend ordinary rules and principles,
and they upon whom supreme responsibility rests
can hardly afford to be impeded by the threads of casuistry.
"

And - again: "How can the golden rule be applied


### ---Economics-1907-0-09.txt---
to the relation of one state to another? None of the
ties which bind man to man can join state to state.
The command 'Love thy neighbor as thyself,' cannot be
applied here. The state is so far from turning the left
cheek to him who strikes the right, that on the contrary,
it does and must endeavor to anticipate even a threatened
blow with an energetic counter-stroke... In short, the
entire chapter of the duties of love, which is the chief
doctrine of the moral law, has no application to the conduct
of the state. A nation depends, not upon the love
of others, but upon the love of self, upon the fostering
and development of its own power and prosperity; and
if we characterize this by the term 'egoism,' -a term indeed
that is scarcely applicable-then egoism certainly is
the foundation of all politics."
In short, this political standard of morality, so often
advocated by statesmen, says practically: Rulers as trustees
for their fellow-citizens cannot follow in all regards
the standards of private morality. It is their duty as
trustees, at all hazards, first to preserve the existence of
their state, and, secondly, to secure its prosperity, as they
see its prosperity. Naturally, also, their willingness to
guard this prosperity is increased by the fact that they as
rulers will gain thru the strengthening of their state.
From this principle thus stated, baldly, and with unpleasant
frankness, is derived the principle in accordance
with which a ruler claims the right and feels the duty to
summon his fellow-citizens to sacrifice their lives for the
advancement of the state; from which he feels called
upon, in case of their refusal, to compel them against
their will to go to war and die for the existence, and often
for merely the greater prosperity, of the state. And as
he defends himself for these public acts (which otherwise
would be murder) on the ground of supporting the


### ---Economics-1907-0-10.txt---
national honor or the national life, so he defends himself
for the commission of other acts less heinous than murder
in private morals, such as deception, bribery, obtaining
property under false pretenses, robbery. If it is
right for nations to fight for their national existence or
for their national honor, it is surely right, he urges, for
them f5o secure information regarding the strongholds,
or the military or naval equipment of the states with
which they may be brought into conflict, by bribing their
officers. If it is right in time of war to seize the territory
of the enemy and keep it (a kind of highway robbery)
in order to have a better defense thereafter
for the home territory, it is surely right to obtain
the same territory for similar purposes by wilfully
creating a misunderstanding about a boundary line and
insisting upon it. Acts such as these I am not defending;
but they are, as a matter of fact, condoned when committed
by statesmen. in many cases they are even looked
upon as praiseworthy.
Without judging these questions now, note the applicability
of these principles to modern business life. When
a great corporation magnate feels himself a trustee for
the interests of his thousands- of stockholders, in some
instances more numerous than the citizens of some of the
smaller states, he finds himself tempted to business acts
which he would reject without hesitation in his private
capacity. The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New
York, for example, has some 6ooooo policy-holders
whose interests doubtless touch closely not less than
3,000,000 people, i. e., more than the population of Denmark.
As heads of political parties, men conscientious
in their private relations, have often not hesitated
to bribe and to use all kinds of -deceit to win
an election, and have excused their acts on the


### ---Economics-1907-0-11.txt---
ground that their opponents are doing the same, and
that the welfare of the state depends upon the success
of their party; so the manager of a corporation,
knowing well that his rivals are violating the law
by accepting rebates, or evading the contract labor law,
or the laws regarding the labor of women and children,
and that if he does not do the same, he must go out of
business, sacrificing thereby the interests of his stockholders,
feels called upon by his sense of responsibility,
misguided perhaps, but none the less real, to do likewise.
Men of irreproachable private life, good husbands and
fathers, Christian gentlemen in their private acts, will at
times send spies to discover the secrets of their rivals in
business, will bribe the employees of their competitors to
disclose the secrets of their employers, will take every
means possible to secure an advantage which in a private
game they would consider unsportsmanlike and mean;
and they will justify themselves to their own consciences
for these acts. When the president of an insurance
company contributed to the campaign fund of a political
party, the success of whose principles he felt would insure
the welfare of his stockholders, he did not feel that he
was stealing from his stockholders; he was using their
money, he thought, as much to protect and preserve their
interests as if he were hiring a policeman or paying for
the services of an expert adviser. A man in such a position
has felt that he must protect the welfare of his company,
and that to him means, usually, to pay the largest
dividends possible. Like the ruler of the state, in many
cases he commits these acts with the greater zeal, altho
sometimes concealing the real motive even from himself,
because an increase in dividends makes his own position
more secure and often increases his own salary. He is
wrong; he has forgotten the still great( interest of the


### ---Economics-1907-0-12.txt---
public. Our eyes now are open; but how many of us
two years ago would have seen clearly if we had been
given the same problem to solve?
The temptation has been more subtle, too, from the
fact that in very many instances fortunes have been made
thru the legal right to enjoy an unearned increment of
profit, whether of rent or monopoly, which tho legally
justified has been economically and socially unjustifiable.
Do not misunderstand me. Tho I find fault with some
of our laws, I am not denouncing our present organization
of society, nor talking about any "natural right,"
nor advocating any sweeping revolutionary measure of
reform. Genuine reforms cannot come that way. Few
customs are altogether wrong. Social wrongs are seldom
suddenly righted. Human nature is not readily
changed. And few business or political principles are
universally applicable. Let us note some examples.
Probably no saner or wiser or juster policy on the
whole was ever adopted by any people than that by which
our country under our homestead laws gave to our frontier
settlers the unearned increment of rent of land-the
policy which has made our central west the granary of
nations, its people perhaps the most prosperous of the
world. But this striking example does not argue that
land-rent should always under all circumstances go untouched
to a private owner; nor that land laws which
work injustice should not be changed. I am not discussing,
for example, absentee landlordism.
Again while private monopolies, copyrights and patents,
and even private ownership of natural monopolies
like gas plants and street-railroads may often be wise and
just, it is still on the other hand clear that very many of
our gifts of franchise of monopolies and many of our
laws which have encouraged monopoly, while constitutional,


### ---Economics-1907-0-13.txt---
have been economically unjustifiable. In fact, they
have been at times productive of manifold political and
social evils. The making of great fortunes, legally, but
in ways felt to be unjust, has in many instances tended
strongly to obscure the moral vision of well-meaning men,
whose weakness has led them gladly to confound legality
with social righteousness. And their acts, again, have
formed the excuse for others to break a law that was
really working injustice.
A profit thru an unjust, tho technically legal, stockwatering
scheme may well prove far more demoralizing
in business circles than an illegal rebate which saves
from ruin a grain-shipper caught at a disadvantage.
But let us not be unjust. These evil practices, these
excuses for wrong-doing, are not confined to our great
capitalists. Even the excuse of trusteeship is not confined
to the managers of the great capitalistic corporations.
It permeates our business life. The same sentiment
is felt by the heads of the great labor organizations.
Like the glow of patriotic loyalty which
leads citizens to sacrifice on the battlefield their own
interests and those of his families and friends
for the honor of their country, the unselfish feeling of
members of trade-unions often leads them heroically to
undergo bitter privation for themselves and for their
families in order to further the welfare of their organization
or of their class in society. But they, too, often go
too far. How often in the appeals of labor leaders we
hear the metaphors of war. They are "battling for the
rights of the toiling masses !" How often we find them
ready to adopt the methods of warfare; to resort to deception,
and even at times to violence. It is hardly too
much to say that, generally speaking, the argument of the
labor leaders against violence in support of their demands


### ---Economics-1907-0-14.txt---
is not that violence under the circumstances would be unjustifiable
on moral grounds, but that it would be unjustifiable
on practical grounds: i. e., it would change the
public sentiment in favor of their employers and would
be likely to make them lose instead of win their fight.
And we all of us in all business relations are very
likely to employ similar methods in a small way. Look
thru the hundreds of columns of advertising in our daily
press and in our magazines.' Everywhere exaggeration
of excellencies, concealment of defects. Seldom
bare, simple truth. Shall we conclude, then, that most
of us have a share in the guilt of our unscrupulous business
magnates ? Is it not clear that the evils have
sprung, not from any real lowering of moral tone,
but from the same age-long mental and moral inertia
which ever leads us into new conditions before we
are ready to readjust old ways of thinking; from
our primitive selfishness which likes to yield to temptation;
and from the naive readiness of our humanity
to find excuses to please our consciences? We are
not worse than were our fathers; we have had the benefit
of enjoying some new temptations before our consciences
have been primed with clearness of economic insight.
Can we find any remedy?
First we must try to see clearly what is the right standdard
of business honor. The aim of the state, i. e., of


### ---Economics-1907-0-15.txt---
society organized for positive action, is to secure for its
citizens not merely life, but abundant life of the highest
type: economic prosperity with moral excellence. It is
for the government to see, and it is for us citizens in a
popular form of government to see, how this can be best
secured; and we must consider not only the distant ideals
toward which we are pressing but we must recognize
with clear eyes and patient heart the weaknesses of
human nature and the conditions which place barriers in
our pathway. Then only we must act.
It is, then, the duty of the state (that is, it is our duty,
for we in our organized capacity are the state)-it is our
duty so far as possible to make the conditions such that
human nature will not be tempted beyond its strength;
but such that thru its struggles it shall gain a new
strength for better and higher work and for the better
and higher life; and that we, individuals, corporations,
and states, shall be able in these conditions so to act that,
in business as in politics, our ideals on questions of morals
and honor may be carried out, as fast as possible, even if
slowly.

The duty, then, is imposed upon the government, upon
us, of changing the conditions of business, so that the
ethical standards of our private life may be more
promptly extended to our ever-changing business life.
The state, for example, must in actual practice forbid the
use by business men of any means which are injurious to
the public interest, such as the building of unsanitary
factories, the unprotected use of dangerous machinery,
the employment of child labor or of laborers under any
conditions or by any methods that the more conscientious,
more merciful employers would not tolerate if they were
not compelled to do so by the competition of their more
unscrupulous rivals. It must cut off the possibility of


### ---Economics-1907-0-16.txt---
special favors to the strong; it must search out and prevent
dishonest practices of those whose wealth comes not
from service but from plunder and fraud, whether legal
or illegal.

Second, it is the duty of all of us to recognize that in
business as well as in politics the laborer is worthy of his
hire. Each of us should feel that our work is primarily
for the service of society; but we should also feel that
when others are rendering a service to us or to society,
they should receive the just reward of that service. Thru
their weakness and thru our selfishness, thru unenlightened
self-interest, (not enlightened self-interest, for
enlightened self-interest takes into view a nobler
society), we have often tempted people into dishonest
practices by holding them down. to unjustly low rewards,
by trying always to buy in the cheapest, not in
the fairest, market. The Consumers' League is
doing a little to combat this tendency, but the bargain
counter is still ahead, in high places as in low.
The demand, public or private, that a man whose services
are actually worth $50,ooo a year shall receive only
$ ,o0o, is as wrong economically and morally as that a
skilled wage-earner shall receive only a pittance to keep
him from starvation. The main difference is that the
strong man is more likely to take indirectly and wrongly
the $50,000 which he feels. he has earned. Under our
competitive system of industry, we as individuals should
be glad to give the largest profit to him who either renders
to society the best service of all the competitors, or
by masterly and just organization of his business can
render equal service with less expenditure of industrial
energy. We should discriminate between fortunes gained
by real service and those gained unjustly by gambling
speculation or oppressive monopoly. We should be willing


### ---Economics-1907-0-17.txt---
to give the largest profit, however large it might be,
to the competitor to whom it is rightly due, because he
has earned it by service. We should not join in the denunciation
of the wealthy simply because they are
wealthy, nor on the other hand object to fair wages because
they are fairly high. We should denounce only
the unjust. It would then be much easier than it is now
to exclude cheating, misrepresentation, adulteration.
Third, The beneficial result of honesty, good laws and
good service can best be secured by publicity. This must
be attained in part by the sanction of the state, in part by
the education of public sentiment. The chief reason
why, under present circumstances, it is necessary to have
business secrets is that the buying public is not willing to
give the higher profit to the man who renders the better
social service and carries on his business with a view to
the real interests of his workmen and of the public. We
assume, generally speaking, that the manufacturer is
asking too high a price, and we are all of us looking for
bargains. When we are willing to pay adequately for
actual service rendered, men can much more easily do
business under the public eye.
INo one realizes better than I do how difficult it will
be to bring about this result. And yet it is certain that
we have already in our society taken many steps in this
direction, and that part of the present outcry against the
abuses of corporations has come just because the public
is so much better trained in this direction, and because we
are more sensitive to justice now than ever before.
Even when these things are done, we may scarcely expect
that there is to be an immediate revolution in moral
ideals or in business practice. We may not hope that by
exposures of corruption, however flagrant, public sentiment
can be quickly changed; that, by act of legislature,


### ---Economics-1907-0-18.txt---
reforms can be quickly brought about; or that by the mere
election of an honest, clean-minded Governor or President,
honesty and honor will at once permeate the public
service and change the tenor of private business. But
we do know that already something has been accomplished
in all these directions, and we think, that by a careful
analysis of the conditions and a steadfast effort on
the part of the thinkers of society, a higher standard of
honor in business as well as in politics can probably be
steadily and surely, tho slowly, approached.
But we must not overlook the political problem: If our
assumption has been true that the apparent lowering of
the standard of business honor in late years has been due
in some degree to the normal shifting of the attitude of
the manager of a great corporation, who feels himself a
trustee for his stockholders, to the attitude of the ruler of
a state, we need, before our study is complete, to judge
the ethical standard of the political ruler. While from
the days of Machiavelli, and, later, of the anti-Machiavel
rulers, students of political science have, with perhaps
equal conscientiousness, differed on the question of the
attitude of rulers in the appreciation of moral principles to
public questions, no one who has observed the trend of
modern history can doubt that both the weight of public
opinion and the practice of governments are steadily uplifting
the ethical standards of rulers toward the ethical
standards of private persons, as idealised in the precepts
and life of the Founder of Christianity. When we realize
that all of us, even in this advanced age, are controlled by
custom in dress, social entertainment, business, politics,
religion; that in many communities the man who eats
with his knife is far more certainly ostracized than the
guilty party in a divorce suit, or the man who gains
wealth by wrecking railroads on the stock exchange, we


### ---Economics-1907-0-19.txt---
need not blame rulers, who, in earlier days, confused
diplomacy and deceit, might and right. They, too, were
merely following custom. But in these days, with the
public opinion of the great nations of the world upholding
the ideals of justice and courtesy, it is far more easily
possible for the ruler of a state to secure its safety and
prosperity, by resting upon the principles of international
law, supported and enforced by the judgment of the
civilized Christian nations. It is coming to be the fact
that it pays a ruler and a state to be just and fair, and to
tell the truth. Among nations as among business men,
in the long run, if the sentiments of individuals are right,
good morals pay. We have every reason to believe that
this tendency also will steadily develop, until not merely
the public, but also the private acts of rulers will be subject
to tests even more rigid than those applied to private
persons in their private capacities.
In this sphere also, as well as in that of business, the
ultimate forces at work are those of human intercourse,
economic, political, social, often working unconsciously,
and public opinion, whose power strengthens as it becomes
conscious. The only way in which we can hasten the
wished-for result (and we must not neglect our task) is
by educating the people-our masters-by giving to them
the right ideals. It must eventually be fully recognized,
as it is beginning to be recognized, that the
greatest service a state can render to itself as well
as to the world, consists, not in warfare, not in extension
of territory, not in hostile rivalry, not in overreaching
foreign countries in dealings with them, but iii
the prosperity which comes from ever more closely linked
intercourse in times of peace; by this intercourse, while
receiving benefit from other countries, each state in return
will render service to them.

I am not advocating a so-called weak foreign policy:
quite the contrary. To be just and honest and truthful, a
ruler need not be blind to the faults of others nor afraid to
stand for the rights of his people. Indeed, he must demand
right as well as do right. But he must look to
ultimate good in the highest moral welfare of his people
and not merely to the glitter of the business profit of today.
The reputation for honesty and truthfulness, too,
will give any statesman a decided advantage in negotiation.
Consider the reputation and success of Secretary
John Hay in his later years. As in the case of private
business, the greatest reward should come for the greatest
service, so, as each country in peace contributes to the
welfare of others, it will receive-as it should receivethe
returns that will be most beneficial.
It is easy to see that the public moral sentiment of the
world is already aroused. And we have every reason to
believe that in the sphere of politics, as well as in that of
business, we shall see an ever-accelerating progress. In
the future, our great business men will not be able to
shelter themselves behind the defense of the statesman,
and claim that the "higher good" impels them to do deeds
that are evil in private life. The issue ultimately depends
upon us. We, the individuals who compose the state,
must shoulder the responsibility. If we make felt, thru
the state and thru public sentiment, our determination to
do right and justice in national affairs and in private
business, and define right and justice in terms of service,
not of selfishness, neither statesmen nor business men will
refuse to yield. It is right for us to find fault with our
politicians and our business men. They have deserved
it; but we should also find fault with ourselves. Their
crimes and cruelties are no more ignoble than are our
petty deceits and meannesses, our selfishness and concealments,

our search for bargains, our eagerness to get on.
It is a cheering fact that we are now seeing the evils in
politics and in business. Our eyes were dim to new
abuses. The misdeeds had to be on a grand scale to attract
our attention. But now we see them; and seeing
them clearly, we shall soon see farther. Ultimately we
poorer, common people in private life will see our own
faults. Then progress will be faster. There is still
much more to do for each of us, in seeing more clearly
the application of the simple, old-fashioned principles of
private honesty to the great transactions of corporate
business and to the still greater problems of statesmanship.


Some years ago, one of my ablest and best-liked colleagues
took me to task because in writing about the
Trusts I had, while trying to point out the evils, noted
some good in them. "But did I not show the bad, and
was not the good true?", I asked. "Yes," he replied in
substance, "I don't deny that; but we want to get the people
to act in correction of abuses; and the people will not
act unless their feelings are aroused. We lull them into
inaction by balancing good and evil; let us show the evils,
the Trusts themselves will show the good." Highly as
I regard my friend, and noble as I know his motives to
be, that seems to me pernicious doctrine. It has in it
the seeds of revolution, not of progress. In social evolution,
the race is rarely to the swift, but always to the
safe and sure, and nothing less than transparent honesty
is safe. Underlying all our social structure is our standard
of business honor with the right application of that
standard to our complex social conditions. This can be
secured only by showing to our people not merely truth
about business, but the whole truth. We must fix our
standard; we must gradually approach it.


### ---Economics-1907-0-22.txt---
Heretofore our business standard has really been: "the
greatest possible reward for self in return for the least
service." When we once see ourselves clearly in our
social relations, in business and in politics, we shall see
that the fitter standard is: "the greatest service possible
for a just reward."

It imay seem a "lame and impotent conclusion" that
there is no legislative panacea for our business ills, but
that upon us as individuals rests largely the responsibility
for our social improvement. Clear-sighted and impartial
observation of facts, including human nature, is our only
safe guide in social reforms; our only methods must be
the commonplace ones of preventing abuses and securing
justice in specific cases by legislation and judicial action
and by compelling men to work in the open-not some
inclusive scheme of social reorganization. We must
content ourselves with this conclusion. Its justification
is our complex human nature and the experience of the
ages.

economists since this association was founded. So popular has
economic thinking become, so prominent is its position in all
colleges and universities, so numerous are the books, articles and
journals devoted to its discussion, that it seems a natural state of
affairs that must always have existed. And yet all this is the
work of a group of enthusiasts, meeting at Saratoga 23 years ago
without a single book to their credit, without journal to voice
their views and without university position to give them support.
Today economics is in everyone's thought and on everyone's
lips. We do not lack students; we do not lack organs or audience;
nor do we lack zeal for the further prosecution of the work already
begun. So much we can fairly claim and all honor to those who
have taken part in the work. If this were our only goal we
might be proudly satisfied with our record and pass on the Association
to our successors with a consciousness of a life's work well
done.

There is, however, no great American problem that has been
solved. With every vital question we stand on a half-way ground,
halting between the old and the new, and if these half truths are
all we have to offer we may harm the public more than we aid
them. Confusion and defeat stare us in the face politically,
morally and economically, if the disappearance of old customs,
traditions and modes of thought is not followed by the rise of new
concepts, ideals and institutions. We cannot afford to be mere
iconoclasts. We must lay the foundation of a new civilization
and show how economic forces will remedy evils that may soon
be unbearable. We have thus a problem-a difficult problem to
master. Are we mastering it or merely drifting with the tide?


### ---Economics-1908-0-02.txt---
If it is hard to divide the centuries into epochs it is still more
difficult to distinguish between parts of a period of twenty years
and yet there is enough difference between the first and second
halves of this period to give them a distinct character. The best
method of illustrating this difference is to examine the change
in our periodical literature. Twenty years ago the dominant
element was thought and theory, while at present description and
illustration have the first place. The theoretic discussions we
now have are by persons who earned their reputations in the
first epoch. The younger generation of economists have evidently
been turned in other directions. The same tendencies are manifest
in doctors' theses. I recall many young men who gained
standing by an essay of not more than thirty pages. They won
recognition by clear thought and a sharply defined thesis. Today
they launch forth in a three hundred page pamphlet that
tires the reader with its massive collection of facts; and the
making of books is going the same road. No one seems willing
to stop short of the German standard by which prestige is gained
through bulky volumes that fill yards of library shelves.
The young doctor with a three hundred page pamphlet to his
credit has worked harder than his predecessor but he has pushed
forward neither the science nor the nation. The writers in journals
state the current problems of the economic world with great clearness
but they leave us muddled as to their solution. And bookmaking
has become an art of collection and restatement that
substitutes clippings and card catalogues for clear thought. Once
when I complained to a fellow writer of the difficulties of bookmaking
he volunteered to show me his method which was to
employ a clipping bureau to send him extracts from papers and
periodicals falling under each of the heads of his book. When
he wrote a chapter he read over these clippings and thus the book
came into being almost of itself. Another writer took a shorthand
reporter with him when he interviewed people familiar with
a selected topic and from this material created an acceptable
book. A more familiar illustration is that of college debaters.
A series of questions is a drag-net that will bring in the best of
the current thought and the questioner can be reasonably sure
to get what he wants with little work on his part.


### ---Economics-1908-0-03.txt---
There are writers whose work deserves commendation and yet
the art of popularizing is so prominent that the fuller view of the
earlier epoch is lost sight of in the struggle for immediate results.
A theoretic writer can no longer gain through his work the commanding
place that would have been given him even a dozen years
ago. Not only has he in this way lost prestige but his work is more
impersonal than it was, so much more so in fact, that he scarcely
ever derives personal advantage from it. The popular speaker
and writer are quoted everywhere and thus gain a name on which
position and income depend. The theorist however finds few
readers and his contrasts when fresh and striking are appropriated
by popular writers without credit. A man who worked for years
on an important topic finally brought out a book that set off his
thought by a brilliant contrast that really contained its essence.
When this was first used by an editorial writer he gave full credit.
Soon editorials by the score appeared in other papers whichgave
the new thought and expounded it by means of the new contrast
but no credit was'given to its author. These writers had apparently
read the first editorial but not the book and cared more for making
an impression than for justice.
In one way the author should be greatly pleased since the end
for which he worked was so easily attained. But in so far as a
personal element was a motive he gained less than if he had been
the author of one of the editorials based on his book. Books
now drop out of sight in a few months; often they are dead before
the reviews of them begin to appear. But their contrasts and
telling phrases live on and are pushed over into the popular
consciousness in a thousand indirect ways that make them effective
and often as immortal as they are impersonal. To-day the
popularizer is so close on the track of the thinker that his book
is made a part of literature before it is dry from the press. To
think clearly is to be altruistic. Honors and rewards come only to
those who by pen or speech pass along to the public the books
and essays it will not read. And the professor, like the writer
and speaker, gets his promotions by what he appropriates. Economists
are not free from tendencies that dominate elsewhere.
And hence it is that each year we pay less attention to clear
thought and more to its expression.
Such considerations warn us of the difficulties economists


### ---Economics-1908-0-04.txt---
must meet and also give the clue as to the line of real progress.
An economist cannot hope to succeed either in gaining
personal renown or in influencing the public by book-making or
essay writing; the only part of his work that lives on is his
charts, diagrams and contrasts. To say this is probably to shock
and possibly to give offense. Most of us have an ambition to
write some day a ponderous volume, and if we lack confidence
in our ability to do this we at least hope some of our contemporaries
will do it for us. "Oh for an Adam Smith or a John Stuart
Mill to do for our age what they did for their own." We all feel
this and long for its realization, and yet those who try fail, not
from lack of ability, but because they are trying an impossible
task and are moved by a false ideal. The first volume of such a
treatise has occasionally been written but the repeated postponement
of the completing parts reveal obstacles that even the
ablest men are unable to surmount. The trouble is that the
author exhausts his contrasts, diagrams and charts in his first
volume and has nothing left for subsequent volumes except hazy
generalizations, dull descriptions and utopian dreams. In contrast
to this ideal of bulky volumes and complete discussion I hold
that the better the economist the clearer, shorter and more precise
are his utterances. The essence of economic literature lies in its
contrasts. A book is merely the trail along which its author
has gone in his search for clear expression and sharp analysis.
This is of great importance to the author but of little consequence
to the reader. In no place can this be more clearly
seen ,than in the Wealth of Nations. Who would go to Adam
Smith for his material? And yet there are hundreds of pages of
it badly arranged and poorly presented. The book would have
gone to the trash pile as soon as printed if this were all there was
in it. The real gems in the book are its fresh contrasts. The
very possibility of a scientific political economy depended on the
contrast of sympathy with self-interest and the form that the
economics of the next century was to take was fixed by the contrast
of land, labor and capital in production and of rent, interest
and wages in distribution. From these contrasts no one has
broken but they all might have been stated on a single page or
put in telling diagram. The five hundred pages of reading matter
which it took Smith ten years to collect and to write is of value


### ---Economics-1908-0-05.txt---
to the student of his development but is of no consequence to
those who after him take up the task of creating economic literature.
Malthus and Ricardo were likewise successful in their
contrasts but failed in their attempts at book-making. The
successful writers of to-day show this fact even more tellingly.
What could have been more important and effective than the
contrast between present and future goods and where is there
more of a failure than the book in which this gem is imbedded?
And if one may without offense pass a judgment on our greatest
living economist I will say that I have pitied him for the pressure
of false ideals which made him spend years to write a volume
of many hundred pages to express contrasts that could have
been more forcefully put in a twenty page pamphlet. No
one can write a four hundred page book that will stand. Telling
contrasts get an immortality that is denied books and the more
concise the expression the longer the life and the greater the
influence. The phrase "Economic Interpretation of History" is
worth more than all the books that seek to expound it. The
force of socialism lies in three phrases " Class Struggle, " " Exploitation
" and "Surplus Value." No one who has mastered these
concepts need study Marx's diffuse and obscure argumentation.
Giddings' Sociology may be divided into two parts, the book and
the phrase "Consciousness of Kind;" and the phrase will outlive
the book. Our concept of the problems of population has been
radically altered by the phrase "Race Suicide." Many volumes
as erudite as Malthus' Principle of Population could not have
had the influence it has had nor thrown so much light on the
problems and tendencies of our age. So, too, The Abolition of
Poverty gives us a thought that volumes of description could
not express, for with one stroke it separates poverty from the
moral background with which it has been associated and shows
it to be an evil for which society is responsible. Poverty is
changed from individual depravity to mal-adjustment and
with this new viewpoint a world is opened up for enthusiasm
and sympathy to conquer. Hobbes' "State of War" Rousseau's
"Natural Man," Ricardo's "Cost Prices." Spencer's "Survival
of the Fittest" are vivid illustrations of the fact that phrases
are more important than volumes and have an immortality that
no scientific book can gain. Only when we recognize this


### ---Economics-1908-0-06.txt---
principle can we see the tremendous waste of time and energy
that book-making has imposed on the scientific world. No group
of scientists has suffered more from this error than the economists.
We have had the misfortune of having our origin in the undifferentiated
field from which has also come the moralist, the political
scientist and the historian. As our traditions come from them
they give to our literature a form not fitting to its content. The
moralist and political scientist naturally cultivate fluency because
their contact with the public is mainly through spoken words.
The historian cultivates elegance and can hardly get started
before the third volume and the sociologist is quite as bad a model
because he starts with Adam and seldom gets beyond Moses.
In such company the economist seems to be a hybrid product
of book worms and hair splitters. In contrast with them his
instincts should be that of a bookkeeper and a cartoonist. He
should be orderly not fluent, clear and concise, not diffuse or
ornate. He should cultivate visual expression by using charts
and diagrams and arouse the imagination by striking phrases
and vivid contrasts. His vehicle should be the newspaper and
the magazine not the scientific journal. The public want what
we have and if we have something it does not want it is not worth
having. To be scientific is to be popular. There is no renown
worth having but that of the newspaper and the magazine and
the class room. To fail of appreciation in these quarters is a
confession of defects that prove a man's unfitness. A student
should go from us to fields less closely attached to the present
where other tests than the power of expression suffice to give
men standing and repute. There can be no economic literature
apart from general literature. We give the content to which
others give the form. To separate ourselves from the general
literary movements of the age is to deprive ourselves of influence
and literature of a content. Other. writers must be our spokesmen;
we must be their guide and inspiration. The place of the
economist is on the firing line of civilization; his product must be
clear, concise and impersonal, instead of being submerged in
bulky volumes and formal treatises. Our real affinity is with
the journalist, the magazine writer and the dramatist and not
with writers, who separated by time and space from what they
describe, function as critics of persons and events instead of being
actors in the -momentous struggles of the present.


### ---Economics-1908-0-07.txt---
I remember the satisfaction I once had when a fellow economist
said "the library is our laboratory." I then thought that our
sources are the accumulated records of past epochs and that what
the past tells about the present is of more value than what the
present tells of itself. If, however, the current economic events
are of more importance than the defective records of the past piled
on library shelves an economist has no business to be in a library
nor to send his students there except as it contains and classifies
current literature. He has less use for a card catalogue of musty
books than for one of events, editorials and articles of the passing
year. We need fresh observations, not fine arguments; we need
clear contrasts not the accumulation, arrangement and restatement
of antiquated obsolete data. No fact is valuable to the
economist unless it is also valuable to the journalist who summarizes
events, the editor who comments on them and the
reformer who uses them. No argument is good in a book or in a
classroom unless it would convince the million readers of a daily
paper and could find place in the campaign book of a political
party. The book goes nowhere unless it goes to the reader of
papers and magazines. Thought is no longer in isolated compartments
affecting only particular persons or classes. Its waves are
like effects of a pebble thrown into the ocean. If it moves the
particles it hits, it moves every other particle no matter how distant.
If we move our students we move the world. If we fail
to move the world we deceive ourselves if we think our students
have been moved by the specialized knowledge we hurl at them.
There is but one real world and whoever would exert an influence
must be in it. Let the historian, the sociologist and the student
of literature have the library and all the gems they rescue from
its dark corners. Economists should work in the open and get
their inspiration from the struggle and evolution which passing
events reveal; for where change is there should also the economist
be.

So long as economic scholarship is associated with library
research we may expect theses to continue as a test of economic
proficiency. Second-hand data and antiquated material thus
get a place they do not deserve. The student is turned away
from real life and often acquires a prejudice against it. A three
hundred page thesis not only does not fit a man to be an economist:


### ---Economics-1908-0-08.txt---
it really incapacitates him for work. The failure of young teachers
is mainly due to the overspecialization that thesis writing invites.
It takes years of hard knocks to realize that the facts of theses
and books are not good material for the classroom. Library economics
is a vice that hampers the growth of the science more
than the hair splitting logic of would-be reformers. We must
some time learn that real investigations cannot be carried on in
libraries no matter how complete they may be. We must also
learn that individual investigators no matter how well directed
seldom add new facts to our fund of knowledge. The range of
social investigations is so great that only largeinstitutions like
the Bureau of Municipal Research, the Russell Sage Foundation,
or the national government can really do effective work. Under
these conditions a thesis is a waste of time and a misapplication
of energy. It merely adds a new statement of old facts to a
market already overstocked. The young economist should be
drilled in effective presentation not in fact accumulation. His
home should be not in the library but in the classroom and when
sufficiently proficient to investigate, he should be loaned by the
university to the government, to local committees or to institutions
capable of handling social problems on a scale that commands
success. The university should furnish investigators but
should not become a mill for turning out small scale investigations
that excite ridicule instead of respect. If it encourages
bookmaking innumerable volumes appear that merely rearrange
old material and give a personal touch to old arguments and
viewpoints. Give men two dollars a page for writing articles
and a journal will have the same facts presented different ways
in each of its volumes. We want, however, net results not the
gross product. Measured in this way our books and j ournals
make a pitiable showing. And this will continue as long as
universities encourage book-making and economic journals pay
for articles and reviews. If these props to misspent efforts were
removed the number of books, articles and reviews would be
reduced to their normal proportion.
A scientific writer should have no other reward than what
comes from a love of work. The test of his growth in thought
is the reduction of the space he uses to present it. It is hard to
tell which is the worse evil: to have a scientific writer expand an


### ---Economics-1908-0-09.txt---
essay into a huge book or for a popular writer to collect his essays
and articles into a similar volume in the hope of passing them off
as a scientific product. Both evils confuse and annoy and can
be removed only by concerted action following a clearer recognition
of the function of economic literature in modern life.
A publisher to whom I offered a book said that it would give
me a reputation but there would be no sales. I have pondered
on that remark many times. Is the reputation that comes from
a book having no sale a real reputation? And is not-and this
question I ask in all seriousness and with much hesitation-is not
a reputation that you or I acquire through books published by
our universities or the periodicals they support a fake reputation
-that it is not honorable for us to have? If there was no real
world and no large audience seeking increased light on current
problems we might be justified in accepting such support and pride
ourselves in the luster it gives. But when real tests of success
are at hand false ideals prevent the application of tests that
would sift the chaff from the wheat. For Jones to write for
Smith and Smith for Jones-or for both of them to write large
books to enable them to pose before college presidents, Boards
of Trustees and admiring groups of friends makes a farce of
economics and prevents its advance. So long as we are useless
pampered creations of false university ideals our books and
pamphlets are of no more consequence than we are when wearing
caps and gowns in a university parade. A bit of color, an impressive
picture perhaps for parents and friends to look at when
they come to see their sons graduate, but something soon to be
forgotten except as a part of a pleasing memory.
In reality our books are of less consequence than caps and
gowns, and I doubt not that universities would profit if they used
the money now spent in printing useless books and journals in
giving more color and grace to public anniversaries. So few of
the public go to libraries or read reviews of pompous volumes,
that self-advertisement in these ways must bring a meager return.
And why shall false investment of time and energy be demanded
when a real public is at hand craving for information and inspiration.
Surely economists have little reason to accept false standards
when real tests are so plainly visible. Teln articles written
for special journals should not give the reputation that comes


### ---Economics-1908-0-10.txt---
from having one accepted by any reputable magazine that makes
effective presentation a test of acceptance.
To outline a program for the reform of economic studies is too
large a task for a presidential address, yet some of its principles
are so evident that the address would lose point without them.
We have consciously tried to create graduate schools of economics
and have failed, yet our work has in an unplanned blundering
way passed over into the undergraduate world and succeeded.
The reason for this is that with undergraduates we have been
forced to cultivate clearness of thought and have thus found a fitting
field for our activities. Reform in the graduate schools means
a like transformation. They must be changed from schools of
acquisition to schools of exprossion. The ideal graduate school
is a school of journalism just as the ideal undergraduate school
is one fitting men for business. We will never make a graduate
school of business, try as we may, but we can create a school of
economic expression that trains men for teaching, magazine writing
and journalism. A good debater is a better economist than
a writer of theses and to have won an intercollegiate debate should
count more than library work. Every economist should seek for
journalistic experience and have his standing measured by his
success. No economist is an economist until he has said to himself,
" I wish I were an editor. "
If this be true the complement for graduate economics is not
history, politics and sociology but literature and law. We should
be grouped with other social sciences when teaching undergraduates
but we should sharply isolate ourselves from them in graduate
work. Our fundamental needs are for the power of expression
and the spirit of legality. Economists are by education and tradition
revolutionists. The Lord made the world in seven days;
we want to remake it in one. So we join hands with anarchists,
socialists and other advocates of violent change and cry ourselves
hoarse in advancing their measures. Economics is like a South
American republic; no one is satisfied unless there is a revolution
once a decade. Law, however, is the one social science that has
advanced solely by evolution and we have much to gain by acquiring
its spirit. And law would gain equally by an alliance with
us; for the socializing of law is the most important and pressing
need of the American people. Legal encrustments of social traditions


### ---Economics-1908-0-11.txt---
are the worst foe of progress. Law can be made mobile
only by the proper appreciation of economic change; economics
can be saved from a series of revolutions only by the spirit of law.
When these two sciences are properly blended evolution will be
constant and progress orderly.
Comrades, are you satisfied? Do you point with pride to what
you have done or do you look ahead for new fields to enter? We
can all, it is true, report an increase of students, more enthusiasm,
better results. But are these worthy objects, the goal of economics?
To me only two ends seem prominent enough to deserve
approbation: the redemption of the college and the control of
public opinion. The one end we can attain through the superiority
of our class instruction; the other we can acquire indirectly
by giving clearer ideals and better programs to those who direct
public affairs. We now have the place in education that Greek
formerly had and upon us therefore depend the perpetuation of
the college and the ennobling of its aims. We must socialize it by
making sympathy, co6peration and generosity its dominant
ideals. What we do for the college our allies can do for the
nation. First the economist, then the journalist and finally the
legislator; this is the order of progress and the key to success.
The world is ours if we enter it by the right door.

(I907) have emphasized the importance of the much
debated question of the relation of government to business.
A few months ago the President of the United
States was in many quarters enthusiastically praised for
his assertion of the power of the federal government to
make business men and corporations amenable to law. A
few weeks ago the voices of most of these acclaimers were
silent in doubt, while another group of people, on account
of these same assertions, were declaiming vigorously
against the President as the immediate cause of the panic.
The question has likewise arisen in our different states in
connection with the Governlment control of insurance
companies, of savings banks, and other business corporations,
some of these of a more or less philanthropic nature,
while, besides the socialists, thousands of our most unselfishly
patriotic citizens have urged upon the public the desirability
of municipal ownership and management of the
water works, lighting plants, street railways and other
so-called public service industries.
It seems a fit time to inquire whether any fundamenltal
principles in connection with this question can be recognized
as having some permanent application. If there
are such principles, they must nlaturally be found in the


### ---Economics-1908-1-02.txt---
nature of government and in that of business. A brief
review of so broad ancd complicated a question, even
though it contains little that is new, may still be useful in
bringing together some old and well-worn but perhaps
partly forgotten truths that may prove suggestive. In
making the attempt in the very brief period of time
allotted, I shall not argue poinlts; I shall simply state
them as settled, even though I am aware that the statement
is debatable. It is often perhaps as great a service
to state a question for discussion as to argue it.
THE AUTHORITY AND CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT
NECESSARY.

2. In all civilized states, whether government be personal
or popular, a fundamental condition of political stability
and of social and economic prosperity is that under
the constitution and customs of the country, so far as the
individual members of society need control, they must be
controlled by government and the government must direct
these activities of the citizens as it thinks best. In a democracy,
and it is chiefly of a democracy that I shall
speak, if the people think that the views or the acts of
their representatives, either in the legislatures, in the
courts, or in the executive chair, are wrong, they may
endeavor to secure a change of the law or a change in the
personnel of their rulers; but in either event, the law,
while it stands, must rule, and the office-holders actually
in power must use their discretion. The interests of the
people, of course, should be safeguarded, and in the long
run, if the people have judgment, they will be safeguarded;
but in any event there cannot be business success without
stable government. The doings of the people in cases
where the government acts, must be through the hands of
officials and these acts must be put into effect in the manner


### ---Economics-1908-1-03.txt---
and in the degree that the officials for the time being
think best. The only legal right that the citizens have,
so far as government activity goes, is that of having
their will carried out through their officials.
IMPRACTICABILITY OF THEORY OF NATURAL RIGHTS.
3. Large numbers of our people find a basis for argument
and apparently much personal comfort in a discussion
of their "natural rights", as if they had rights
opposed to the legal rights given them by the state. Such
an expression is, of course, an excellent talking point as
a basis for argument to convince people, and perhaps
through themn to change the opinion of the government as
to what otight to be done. But, as an immediate principle
to direct governmental action, the theory of natural rights,
as interpreted by the individual beyond what is laid
down in law is a Ivagary of enthusiasts, a breeder of fanatacism;
aind it is harmful, because it turns aside from
practical means the minds of many of our most unselfish,
high-minded, public-spirited citizens. The only sound
basis for advocating a change in governmental policies
is that the welfare of society will be improved by the
chalnge advocated. Let all arguments for social reform
be made on this basis; let the weight of argument show
the practicability of securing the desired benefit; convert
thereby as many of the citizens as possible; thus you
may convert the government. The whole question of
governmental activity in business matters is not one of
the "natural right" of an individual as against his government
or against his fellow citizens; it is one of the
thoughtful judgment of the few men who are directing
the affairs of political society as to the practicable means
for doing their duty under the powers laid down in the
constitution and laws.

CITIZENS MUST RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF
GOVERNMENT.

4. Too little emphasis is often laid upon the importance
of having fixed in the minds of the citizens of every
country the fundamental principle that the only way in
which citizens can act politically on any social question is
through the government. There exists of course the socalled
right of revolution, but this may be ignored as
foolishly impracticable in this connection. In all countries,
though most easily in a democracy, the will of the
citizens may comparatively easily be brou-ht to expression
if people are thoughtful and active, and not one proposed
reform in a thousand is important enough in its effect
upon the welfare of the citizens to justify any setting
aside of the authority of government for its accomplishment.
People sometimes foolishly, on account of the
slowness of governmental action or the corruption of a
few government officials, apparently despair of the success
of popular government. How many times within
the last ten years we have heard wild talk about the
ownership of our government by the moneyed classes,
and of the impossibility of having a wealthy malefactor
brought to justice. Some of our late governmental actions,
such as the judicial decision in the Northern Securities
case, the investigation of the insurance companies
in New York, and the exposure of the Trusts by the
Bureau of Corporations, have been chiefly valuable, not
for their immediate results, but for showing the public
clearly and conclusively the very simple but all important
truth that government can and does rule. How far then
the government of any state shall control business and
business men and in what manner, is a matter within the
determination of the government itself, keeping always
the welfare of the citizens in view.


### ---Economics-1908-1-05.txt---
GOVERNMENT CONTROL WILL VARY UNDER INFLUENCES
OF VARIOUS KINDS.

5. The extent and method of its conrtrol of industry
will vary in different coulntries and under differing circunstances.
There can be no general rule laid down but
this: The action of the government ought to be based on
the special circumstances of each individual case. All
comparative studies of the experiences of differenit countries
in different lines of industry can be only suggestive.
For the settlement of any such question, however, various
factors will always be found which must be taken into
careful consideration.
POLITICAL CONDITIONS AFFECT CONTROL.
a. The political circumstances of the country, determined
quite possibly by geographical considerations, will
often be a dominating factor. Germany, for example, is
so situated geographically between France and Russia
that, in order to be certain that it can maintain its independent
existence under threatening circumstances, it
must be prepared to concentrate its military power in overwhelming
force with the greatest rapidity at the shortest
notice. Under such circumstances, considering modern
methods of warfare, its railroads should be built primarily
to serve promptly its military needs, although, of
course, its network of lines will probably in the long run
serve this need best if it also serve well economic ends.
Likewise the management of these roads must be such
that the government without materially lessening their
efficiency, can take immediate control and direct the traffic
to military ends with little loss of energy. The government
of Germany then must so control its railways as to
keep them always in readiness for war. It must own and
manage them, even thotigh in so doing it were to weaken


### ---Economics-1908-1-06.txt---
their economic efficiency. A similar line of argument,
altho entirely different in detail, might well apply to Russia,
to Fran-ce and to many other countries, while it would
have application in only a slight degree to Canada, to
Brazil, or to the United States.
CONTROL ULTIMATELY NOT A MATTER OF LAW, BUT OF
ECONOMICS AND POLITICS.
1b. The question has of late often been discussed,
sometimes in a rather heated way, whether the control
of the railways of the United States should be state or
federal, and in what degree our cities should, of their
own motion, control their lighting planits, and tlhe answers
to these questions have often been sought along
the line of legal precedent. The question is ultimately
not one of law, but of economics and politics. Considering
our form of government, a court decision of fifty
years ago may, to be sure, for the present, be a determining
factor; but in the long run, such a question is not to
be answered by legal precedent; it is a matter of economic
and political benlefit. As the decades pass by, industrial
inventions and economic conditions bring about
changes so important that our legislatures and our courts
are gradually forced to recognize them. The clause in
the Constitution of the United States concerning commerce
between the States, in the minds of the members
of the Conlstitutional Convention of 1787, referred to
local tariffs, to commerce on a small scale by water, or to
petty traffic in wagons over state boundary lines. If our
Constitution is to do its work, it must gradually have its
meaning adapted by Congress and the courts to new conditions
as they arise, and no technical interpretation in a
judicial decision can ultimately stand against the interests
of the community as they are affected by economic


### ---Economics-1908-1-07.txt---
c'hanges. Our courts declare the law, it is true, but in
declaring the law, they must keep ini mind the fact that
the intention of prime importance in the minds of our
forefathers was the welfare of the people throughout the
coming generations; and they will not rigidly insist upon
an unchanging applicatiotn of old words to new conditions.
The Courts will of course be slow and careful
in their adaptations of laws to new conditions, but eventually
the conditions will force the reasonable interpretation.
Some people are of the opinion that our Courts
of last resort would be strengthened in this kind of work
if one or two mnembers were men trained primarily not in
law bu-t in the principles of business. The suggestion is
worth careful consideration. In the discu-ssion oI stuch
questions as these just asked, therefore, the point chiefly
to be kept in minid is this: Are the local and state governments
so organized that they can meet the new economic
conditions? We need not now inlquire what specific
conditions the foulinders of our government had in mind
when they wrote the Constittution, with the added thotught,
perhaps, that we must, so far as possible, attempt to hold
oulrselves back to the conditions of a century ago. With
present conditions in mind, federal control of interstate
railroads seems the only reasonable control.
CONTROL DETERMINED BY PEOPLE S ECONOMIC HABITS
AND CHARACTER.

C. We must keep continually in mind also as important
factors, determining the extent and nature of government
control, the character and industrial habits and
temper of the people. If the citizens of a country are
ignorant, unenterprising, poor, weak, they will have little
initiative and the government must take into its own
hands the organization, financing and management of


### ---Economics-1908-1-08.txt---
important industrial enterprises until the people can themselves
be trained by observation and gradually increasing
experience to undertake them. It may be that in many
instances, the government which thus controls and directs
large industrial enterprises, and which should act for the
benefit of the people as a whole, will be corrupt, and that
considerable profits, even great fortunes, will be turned
into the pockets of the corrupt officials. But even granting
that tlhis may be clone (for I wish to blink no truth,
however unseemly), the evil is probably only temporary
and one that is perhaps in some countries almost to be
expected. Even under the most adverse circumstances
the benefit to the people from the industries and from the
training which they get along industrial and political lines
will in all probability bring them further forward in civilization
and will enable them sooner to get both the honest
control and the economic benefit than if the undertaking
of the enterprise were delayed until among the people
themselves were found men with the initiative and the
capital to direct a great industrial enterprise, like, for
example, the building of the Assouan darn in Egypt or
the Trans-Siberian railway, or the Panama Canal.
On the other hand, if the people are intelligent, enterprising,
wealthy, in very many instances they will
develop the industries of a country without political danger
far more rapidly by themselves under merely slight
governmental supervision than such enterprises could
possibly be developed by the government itself.
BY PEOPLE' S HABITS OF POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OR
SUBSERVIENCE.

d. Again, if a people have been for generations under
rigid governmental control, being used to dictation and
subservience, the government management becomes both


### ---Economics-1908-1-09.txt---
easier and more necessary, while a people that is alert,
ambitious, and used to self-direction, will, in general,
prefer to do its own work and can successfully do it.
BY NATURE OF INDUSTRIES CONCERNED. THOSE CONNECTED
WITH GOVERNMENT.

e. I. The character of the industry, too, affects strongly
the extent and nature of governmental control over it.
Certain industries are so closely associated with the government
that is it practically essential that the government
manage them. The necessity of careful and rapid transmission
of intelligence on government business led governments,
even in ancient times, to establish post roads
and relays of messengers by whom orders could be sent
from the central government to outlying provinces.
Gradually out of this necessity of government has grown
our post-office system which seems now to exist primarily
for the conduct of private business; but if, as at times
has been suggested, the post-office business were to be
put into private hands, the government would still need to
exercise control so rigid that its own messages would
certainly be carried promptly and secretly. For similar
reasons governments as a rule erect their own forts,
maintain their own arsenals, and usually build their own
warships. Entirely aside from the question of relative
cost, most governments will prefer to build their own
war-ships; and even where this is not done in their own
yards, the government control must be absolute.
THOSE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE.
e. 2. Even some industries that are not practically a
part of the government's business, may yet be of so
fundamental concern to practically all citizens that it
would be considered dangerous to leave them in private


### ---Economics-1908-1-10.txt---
hands, provided the individuals concerned could make of
the business a matter of personal profit. For this reason
the coinage of money is considered a function of sovereignty.
Banks are put more strictly than most other lines
of industry under government control. In our own country,
since education is looked upon as the foundation of
good government, our schools have become public schools
and the element of personal profit has been almost entirely
eliminated from our educational system. It may seem
odd to class schools with industries, but some schools, I
fear, grind out graduates for profit. Still schools run
for private profit now occupy a very subordinate position
and are to be considered only as supplementary to
our public schools for the benefit of those who have
liberal means of support. The extension of our postoffice
facilities into remote country districts, where the
receipts do not nearly cover expenses, is justified on the
same grounds. The cheap and rapid transmission of
information, as a means of education, must be carried
even into districts where a private corporation could not
afford to do the work.
THOSE REQUIRING GREAT CAPITAL WITH RETURNS LONG
DELAYED.

e. 3. In earlier times, before the financial resources of
the leading countries were so great, and before the corporation
as a method of business organization had become
common, all enterprises requiring great capital had to be
in the hands of the government in order that the resources
of the country could be tapped by taxation to
undertake them. Under modern conditions in Europe
and America this is no longer necessary, but wherever
the returns from the investment are only remote, governments
still sometimes need to undertake such enterprises.


### ---Economics-1908-1-11.txt---
Several of the most important governmental activities in
the United States to-day, although industrial in nature,
are of this type, especially those which relate to the
development and conservation of our national resources.
Foremost in the public eye is the Panama Canal; but of
scarcely less importance are the noble plans of the present
administration for the development of our great inland
water-ways, the bringing under cultivation through irrigation
of vast tracts of territory otherwise arid and
useless, the reclamation of swamps and bayous through
the building of levees and drainage ditches, and the
rapidly developing movement for the conservation and
eventually the profitable cultivation of our forests. All
these enterprises are of such a nature that, although they
are fundamentally industrial and ultimately enormously
profitable, the government, to protect the interests of
coming generations, must exercise immediate control and
in most cases must carry on the industry as a government
enterprise. Most of these colossal undertakings, however,
are of such a nature that the larger part of the direct
work can be done, if necessary, through the aid of private
corporations, the government retaining ownership and
exercising control in the careful inspection and supervision
of contracts.

THOSE MENTIONED BY JEVONS: MONOPOLISTIC, SIMPLE,
PUBLIC, NEEDING LITTLE CAPITAL.
e. 4. It has been the usual experience that wherever
the element of private profit enters into the management
of industry, the work of administration is likely to be
more efficient and the cost of production decidedly lessened,
so that we need to note what kinds of industries
may be managed by the government with least waste. In
i867, in his address before the Manchester Statistical Society,


### ---Economics-1908-1-12.txt---
defending the direct management of certain lines of
business by the state, Professor Jevons laid down in his
suggestive way the following principles concerning the
industries, and the only industries, he thought, which
could wisely be managed by the state:
I. Where numberless widespread operations can only
be efficiently connected, united and co-ordinated, in a
single and extensive government system.
2. Where the operations possess an invariable routinelike
character.

3. Where they are performed under the public eye or
for the service of individuals, who will immediately detect
and expose any failure or laxity.
4. Where there is but little capital expenditure, so that
each year's revenue and expense account shall represent,
with sufficient accuracy, the real commercial conditions of
the department.

The post-office is perhaps the best example of such an
industry. Professor Jevons thought these principles applied
fairly well to the telegraph and parcels post, but
not to railways. As applied to England thirty years ago
his opinion was probably sound. The experience of the
last few years would probably permit in several countries
some extension of these principles; but they are still
extremely suggestive and useful in testing industries
which the government contemplates managing.
GREAT EXECUTIVE TALENT BEST PAID BY PRIVATE
COMPANIES.

6. The success of all great industrial enterprises depends
largely upon the executive head-he must be interested
and be as intelligent and as skilful as possible.
Such men must ordinarily be chosen only for the sake
of the business itself. The experience of centuries has
shown that, take it by and large, the motive of selfinterest
is the one that can best be counted upon to


### ---Economics-1908-1-13.txt---
secure the best executive talent. Under our present stage
of civilization private corporations will give higher pay
and better facilities for individual initiative and skill in
work than is possible for the State in the present condition
of public opinion. It is generally conceded here as well
as in England that lawyers and captains of industry
receive far greater rewards in private life than in public.
Some striking examples have been afforded in recelnt
years by the men who abandoned the greatest engineering
enterprise of the present century, the Panama Canal, in
order to enter the service of private corporations.
BUT MEN SERVE ALSO FROM SENSE OF DUTY.
And yet, on the other hand, the attractiveness of public
service for its own sake and for the sake of the distinction
of office or from the sense of patriotic duty, is likewise
not wanting. Men now in the Cabinet, on the bench
of the Supreme Court of the United States and in the
CouLrts of Appeal in our states, have sacrificed tens and
scores of thoousands of dollars a year to enter the public
service. Every person of wide acquaintance can nmention
instances from among his own list of friends. It is perhaps
most usual to find instances of devotion to public
service among men who have been especially trained for
that, as in our officers in the army and navy. The only
possibility of special reward for men of this type is the
added reputation of doing excellent work in a position of
great responsibility and the consciousness of duty well
done. The spirit inculcated at Annapolis and West
Point stands ready to sacrifice self if necessary for the
sake of duty. I am glad to say that I have found not a
little of this same spirit of devotion to duty in the civil
service. I think it is rapidly extending and that this will
soon materially affect our government work. On the
other hand, men trained to rigid unquestioning obedience,


### ---Economics-1908-1-14.txt---
whose entire life is placed at the disposal of their superiors
f rom day to day, are, I think, likely to lack somewhat
in the personal initiative demanded of those whose
way from obscurity to success must be fougLht through
stern competition. In private management of business
the weak are rutlhlessly cut out, the strong move forward.
In public life men are much more likely to receive positions
through political pressure or through a type of
examination that does not give the best test of efficiency,
or through routine work and length of service. For
these reasons we ordinarily expect to find, and experience
shows that the expectation is well-founded, that enterprises
will generally be carried through mnore promptly
and with less expense in the hands of private managers
than under public management.
ATTITUDE TOWARDS SOCIALISM.
7. These circumstances indicate clearly the wise attitude
toward socialism, if by socialism we mean the policy
of taking into the hands of the state for ownership and
management the capitalistic industries. Possibly such a
policy may be best in some ages and climes; such a policy,
however, could be successful in modern industry only
by a change of human attributes or of social conditions
so great as to be practically revolutionary. An avaricious
man is not likely to become public-spirited in office; he
will rather prostitute his office to personal gain.
We need not, however, be frightened by a name. It
may well be, that, under certain circumstances, a city may
find it wise to own and manage its water works and its
street railways; under other circumstances for special
reasons, usually political, a state must administer its
railway system; again, a great manufacturing enterprise
or a gigantic work of public betterment may wisely be
carried through by the state. Experience, however, in


### ---Economics-1908-1-15.txt---
various ways and under differ-ing circumnstances will
show that for the present at an-y rate such instanlces are,
relatively speakin-g, rare. Wherever it is miade clearly
probable that the policy of public managemenlt is wise, it
shouldl be adopted; but it would be unwise to declare offhand
that all capitalistic enterprises at any time in any
future, however remote, can best be managed by the
state. It is unsound even to put that forward as a
desirable end. The end looked for is the welfare of the
citizens. Wherever and whenever that can best be secured
by public ownership anld 1nanagement there can be
no objection to such form of enterprise. Under present
conditions such a policy is relatively seldom wise, for
both economic and political reasons. The burden of
proof in each case rests upon those advocating it.
AND TOWARDS ANARCHY.
The other extreme of governmental policy, scientific
anarchy, or the practical abandonment of all governmental
conltrol, is still less often possible; but we may
freely concede that either socialism or scientific anarchism
in special ages and in special countries might be wise.
CONTROL BY COMMISSIONS OR INSPECTORS.
8. Less rigid and less difficult than direct management
is the control that governments may have in connection
with the system of private enterprise. A legislature or
the executive may lay down fixed rules for certain lines
of industry, and a commission or an inspector may apply
these rtules in special cases. We have in many states
railway commissions and bank inspectors whose work is
largely judicial in nature. This kind of work does not
demand so ambitious a talent, nor a talent so high-priced,
although the judicial gift is no less useful to the public,
and possibly no less rare than those of the captains of


### ---Economics-1908-1-16.txt---
industry. Even, therefore, where it seems best to abandon
the idea of direct public management of industry,
it is well within the power of the government and may
much more frequently be found advisable to adopt a
system of rigid public control.
EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL MANAGEMENT UPON THE
PEOPLE.

9. Of vastly more importance than the immediate
ecomnonic result, whether good or ill, of the government
management of industry, are the indirect effects upon
the temper and intelligence and development of the people.
The effects of government activity in industry are
some of them good, some bad. It is desirable to discriminate
carefully, and in determining a governmelnt's policy
to perform so far as possible only acts that will have a
good effect upon the people.
IT MAY SET AN EXAMPLE TO PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS.
As has already been explained, the government activity
in behalf of the general welfare can at times be carried
out on lines impossible for a private company. It is possible
for the government, if necessary, to support an-i
industry in part by taxation, as, in order to increase the
general intelligence, we in part support our post-office.
For the same end the Government may in certaini lines
make experiments, industrial as well as political. With
careful regard for cost of work and justice to the taxpayer
the Government in its industrial enterprises should
lead and educate public opinion in promoting the welfare
of society. In all government enterprises, a standard of
excellence should be set in the quality of work done, in
the conditions of work of the laborers, in strictness of
accounting, in upright maanagement.


### ---Economics-1908-1-17.txt---
IT SHOULD FIX LIMITS OF COMPETITION.
It may sometimes be desirable, in order that the benefits
of private enterprise may be secured without giving to
private corporations the unreasonable profits which under
certain monopolistic circumstances they might be able to
secure, that the government compete directly with private
enterprise in order to hold prices within reasonable bounds.
It might become best for the post-office, for example, to
extend its parcel post in competition with the express
companies. Ordinarily, however, the government can
best direct the private management of public enterprises
through inspection and supervision rather than by direct
competition. We must recognize the fact that competition
affords on the whole the best stimulus to effort, to
originality of thought, and to the development of personality
in enterprise. The government may thus, as
already intimated, speaking generally, secure the public
welfare best by encouraging private enterprise, simply
fixing the limits of competition within standards of
honesty and efficiency of service. This principle of
competition, too, it should be recognized, is found not
merely in business where the reward is money profit, but
likewise in all other fields of endeavor, where the reward
may be fame or merely a spirit of self-satisfaction over
good work well done. There is competition in football,
even in philanthropy, as well as in money making. The
government should simply see to it that the competition
in all directions is kept within fair and just limits.
THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ESCAPE THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF CONTROL.

IO. Whether the government will or no, it cannot
throw off the responsibilitY of supervision and control
over such industrial enterprises as we have considered,


### ---Economics-1908-1-18.txt---
and it seems certain that, unless business men learn to
recognize more fully their obligations to the general public,
the government must extend the range of its control.
IT MUST EXTEND ITS CONTROL UNLESS BUSINESS
PRACTICE CHANGES.

I I. Many of the business men of the country do not
yet fully recognize their obligations to the public, nor do
they see clearly the fiduciary character of their business.
They are trustees for the public in no small degree.
Tlaey excuse themselves for many acts inimical to the interests
of the public on the ground that they may prove
beneficial to their stockholders-and this in all good
faith. With the increase in the size and complexity of
business organizations, however, the principle of caveat
emptor ought not to be made to apply in general. The
common man cannot care for his own interests. A depositor
in a bank, for example, cannot of himself judge
the risks he is taking. If the banker will not carefully
protect his depositor, the Government should compel him
to do so by more rigid control.
RELATION OF THE PANIC TO GOVERNMENT CONTROL.
The fact is that the late widespread suspension of cash
payments throughout the country, disguised somewhat by
the use of clearing house certificates and other devices,
and by the fact that bank notes were safe, is a public
calamity due less to the activity of any government official
than to the need of more rigid government control. Failure
to honor a check in cash is enough of the nature of
failure to redeem a bank note so that such an act ought
not to be passed over lightly. Our bankers, in order to
pay high returns to their stockholders, had in some instances
gone much beyond the limit of safety in reducing


### ---Economics-1908-1-19.txt---
their reserves. They had too often resorted to practices
doubtful for a fiduciary business; they had counted deposits
in other banks as part of their owni resources, a
practice which, though legal, is of doubtful wisdom, and
when the storm came, each looking to his own need (with
the exception of some of the larger establishments whose
own close relations with the market compelled action),
got what cash he could and retained it in his vaults, thus
increasing the tension of the stringency. Unless the
bankers can devise better plans than they now practice
for checking the reckless among their fellows and hearteninag
the over-cautious, the Government must play a
more active part in control. I do not mlean that the
Treasutry is to be more active in an emergency. The
governnient must do more to prevent the emergency's
arising. And this principle applies, not only to banks, but
with greater emphasis to all great companies, railroads
and trusts, AVhose stocks are at the mercy of the directors,
and the prices of whose products within rather broad
limits are only slightly regulated by competition. What
does a stockholder in a great corporation like the American
Tobacco Co., or the American Sugar Refining Co., or
the Standard Oil Co., or any of the 50 largest Trust companies,
kncew of the real value of his holdings and of what
may be done within three months to increase or lower the
value? And what does the public know of the measures
that may be taken to increase or lower the prices which
the grocers must pay the manufacturing, companies for
their goods? Business men in these important positions
will in time learn their duty toward the public, but probably
the Government must lead the way. The change
from small industrial conditions to large has come so
swiftly that the business men in most cases are not morally
to blame for their lack of adjustment to new conditions,


### ---Economics-1908-1-20.txt---
but they will be blameworthy, if they delay, and
the Government does well to stimulate their activity.
SUMMARY.

I2. It would be beyond my purpose at the present time
to apply these general principles to specific cases in the
United States, and to give my opinion as to exact rules
that the Government should lay down or as to the
industries which the public should own or control. I
consider only a few general principles. This much may
be said in summary. In the discussion of such questions
as public control of public service corporations we ought
not to be swayed at all by the fear that we shall be called
either socialists or scientific anarchists. We should recognize
that there is mnuch truth in the teachings of those
who advocate government ownership and management;
perhaps an equal amount of truth in the teachings of
those who advocate the let-alone policy carried to the
extreme. The public and scientific thinkers owe a debt
to both classes. It is our duty to judge each individual
case on its own merits, taking into account local conditions,
industrial, political, and personal. Moreover, we
should recognize the fact that society and political institutions
are changing and progressing and that a policy
wise to-day may be unwise twenty years hence; that a
policy successful in Europe will probably not be equally
successful here; that in no case can we accept as conclusive
the experience of others or even our own present experience;
and that on the whole the government probably
needs to extend its control especially over the larger companies,
unless their managers take the ptiblic more fully
than now into their confidence. In every case our final
appeal is to common sense, good judgment, and an unselfish
regard for the public welfare.

is not intended to revive the old discussion of the relative
merits of the deductive and the inductivTe methods.
I desire to avoid controversy, and shall therefore grant
that political economy is "essentially hypothetical in
character"; and, for the sake of harmony, I am willing
to take oath to Jevons's statement that "however useful
may be empirical knowledge, it is yet of slight importance
compared with the well-connected and perfectly explained
knowledge, which constitutes an advanced and
deductive science." But while there is no intention of
contrasting the relative importance of abstract reasoning
and observation of facts, it will also be taken for granted
that the expert in hypothesis welcomes observation and
the accumnulation of facts, either to verify the propositions
which have been advanced or to lay a substantial
basis for further speculation.
It is assumed then that there is no jealousy between
these two co-workers, theory and observation; and that
each ungrudgingly recognizes the services of the other.
It is also assumed that an unrelated and unrelatable fact
is rubbish, fit for the waste basket; and that an hypothesis
unsupported by fact is a spirit of mischief which deserves
eternal imprisonment.
The activity which is displayed at the present time in
the collection of facts relating to the interests of the
economic life may well excite admiration. In no delpartment
of human effort is there greater ardor. It is characteristic
of the work of govern-menlt bureaus, legislative


### ---Economics-1910-0-02.txt---
committees, judicial investigations, commercial and philanthropic
organizations, endowed trusteeships for research,
magazines whose curiosity penetrates into the
remotest corner, as well as a host of unattached students.
Great progress has been made in the past twenty-five
years. Although the domesday survey mapped out in the
celebrated census of i88o was a notable achievement, the
range of observation since that date has been vastly extended.
We know how many eggs were laid in Alaska;
we measure the glass surface of florists' establishments;
we have laid bare the balance sheets of the counting room;
in our census we distinguish between one and two-seated
sleighs; we can tell the proportion of checks to other
monetary media; we know how much gold is consumed in
dentistry; we have explored the mysterious labyrinths of
monopolies and large industrial corporations; we have records
of accidents and strikes; we have studied analytically
the causes of poverty and degeneration; we have observed
the physical and mental condition of children and have
made record of the food they eat and of the hours they
sleep.

Activity in observation does not mean that the work is
well done, or that there is an intelligent consideration of
the means to an end. Notwithstanding the activity, we
are disposed to distrust the accuracy of much of the descriptive
and statistical data thus collected, and we seek
in vain for material which is wanting. Examples will be
readily called to mind. We are still in doubt as to the exact
changes in rates of wages for equivalent amounts of
work performed; we still have a misgiving as to the variations
in prices, although we freely admit that this is giving
way to confldence; we are still in the dark as to the cost of
production of the staples of consumption; we still are tin--
able to frame reliable survivorship tables for lack of statistics


### ---Economics-1910-0-03.txt---
of births; and we still want important monetary facts
in order to deal intelligently with the currency problem.
But aside from omissions, there is the confusion in the
facts which are now available. Well may we long with
Professor Clark for the "discovery of facts which meai
something and are capable of orderly arrangements and
interpretation." Otherwise, as he says, "there is danger
of collecting a mass of information so vast and chaotic
that it will be useful chiefly as a means of moral disciplinle
for the baffled student."
For the present difficulties it seems to me that we are
largely to blame. In devoting attention so exclusively
to "determining what are likely to be the immediate and
ultimate effects of various groups and causes", economists
have lost sight of a certaini share of their elementary
responsibilities, and because of this the science suffers.
It is not to be inferred, however, that economists
have shirked intentionally. I believe they appreciate the
need of observation and exact data, and that never were
they - so far as their reasoning goes - more free from
dogmatizing than at the present time; but in the more
absorbing interest of abstract processes, they have quite
naturally failed to become' acquainted with the methods
of the work of their - I will not say neighbors, but servants
who provide the facts.
Consider the recent systematic text-books on political
ecomony. The method of exposition is largely through abstract
reasoning; some of them, indeed, may fairly be
termed treatises in applied psychology. And here again, I
have no complaint to offer. It is probably the best method
of presenting the subject as a scientific body of knowledge,
but this method does not necessarily involve the use of
facts except in most general terms. The ordinary reader
does not realize that these general affirmations are based


### ---Economics-1910-0-04.txt---
upon the assembling of a large number of concrete units
which have been so frequently observed and recorded
that they have lost their individual identity and become
merged into a generalization which appears as an abstract
formula instead of a familiar vitalized phenolmaenon.
Again this is no criticism of the method; it is true
of all scientific exposition, including natural and physical
sciences. But what are the consequences?
Other sciences have their laboratories with an army
of observers and experimnenters. In nearly every instance
the abstract reasoner is himself an observer and expnerimenter.
He is, at any rate, sufficiently skilled in observation
and experimentation to guide and check the observations
of his assistants. It is agreed, however, that
political economy cannot use a controlled experiment as
one of its tools, and that in so far it is not to be compared
with the physical sciences. It is, moreover, agreed that
observation in the field of economic life is extremely
difficult, but no one, it is to be presumed, will admit that
because of this difficulty observation is to be abandoned.
So far as I am aware, no one has proposed this; although,
because of this obstacle, some have despaired of
there being any true science of political economy. If we
refuse to accept this discouraging alternative, we must
have observation, difficult though it may be. If this be
conceded, the subject has two practical aspects, first the
need of finding a place for its exercise in our courses of
instruction, and, second, the need of directing and improving
the vast amount of observational work in the interest
of public welfare.

The subject of economics is taught to an increasing
nuLmber of youth, and the growing interest is likely to
continue. The pedagogical responsibilities are thuts becoming
more and more serious. All will agree that


### ---Economics-1910-0-05.txt---
accurate observation is a desirable object of educational
effort, and that the student should receive some
instruction which will enable him to recognize and classify
the facts of economic life. And it is here that
writers of systematic treatises might very properly in
their introductory chapters place greater emphasis upon
the character and service of observation. As a rule, our
text-books dwell uponl definitions, methods of reasoning,
the relative value of deduction and induction, the application
of mathematical ideas, and the scope of economics
as distinguished from cognate sciences; but give very litthe
attention, if any, to the part which observatioln plays,
its importance and its limitations.
The instructor has at least one, if not all, of three ends
in view: (i) The development of mental power on the
part of the student irrespective of the acquisition of any
particular facts; (2) the acquisition of a certain nLumber
of useful facts in regard to the business world, irrespective
of their ifumediate relation to general prinlciples;
and (3) a mastery of the principles and a knowledge of
the facts so that the future citizen can apply himself with
some degree of gratification to himself, and some degree
of benefit to the world, in the explanation of economic
problenms as they press upon him; At present these aims
are imnperfectly met. It is generally acknowledged, I believe,
by teachers that the method of instruction is unsatisfactory,
and, in so far as the instructor follows the
text-book, the student too frequently agrees with this
judgment. This is a natural consequence of existing conditions.
The student by previous training is unable to assimilate
the psychological generalizations dogmaticallv
assumted in the text-book exposition; and the facts which
are supplied by the instructor at irregular ilntervals, in
unequal doses ranging from a single phenomenon to a


### ---Economics-1910-0-06.txt---
mass, chapter-deep, culled at random both as to time
and as to territory, do not fit into a system of reasoning
so as to make a lasting impression. As a result the student
leaves the subject with but a hazy notion of the
science as a whole; and, what is worse, has not made an
adequate gain in mental power through the training of
his faculties in abstract reasoning.
For my part, notwithstanding my interest in the descriptive
characteristics of the economic life, I am often
drawn to the conclusion that for the sake of the student
it would be better to accept economics as a deductive
science pure and simple, and treat it as a series of rigorous
exercises in abstract reasoning, rather than to perpetuate
the disconnected, mixed, and incongruous
method which so many text-books impose upon us today.
The doubt is prompted because we find so much apparent
variation in the abstract reasoning. It may be that this
is an unfair judgment, and that there is a larger content
of accepted reasoning that I have implied; but, if this
is true, the language of exposition and the terminology
employed have so disguised the familiar concept that it
appears to be a stranger.
We may hope, however, that progress will be made
toward agreement even within a limited field. When
this is accomplished, and there is a sufficient amount
of material presented in a form which can be safely
turned over to the student, from which he can with confidence
gain a knowledge of the fundamental principles
and their application as derived by logical processeswhen
this is done, our problem will be greatly simplified,
for the writer or the teacher will no longer be harrassed
by the feeling that in some way he must make good the
uncertainties of his reasoning by thrusting into his exposition
a certain amount of useful knowledge relating to


### ---Economics-1910-0-07.txt---
the economic life. The study and presentation of the
facts will then occupy a separate field of its own; its cultivation
will be carried on by independent and intelligent
methods for certain definite, clearly prescribed ends.
Pending this happy deliverance, however, what can be
done for the student, and what can be done to save observation,
induction, and the significance of facts so that
their imiiportance will not be wholly lost?
Taking political economy as it is written, it is that
body of knowledge which treats of the relation of the
wants of m'ien to thing,s which will gratify these wants.
Even many of the authors who retain the classical definition-
of political economy as well as the traditional division
of the subject into four parts, in which emphasis
is put upon the physical world instead of psychical wants,
are influenced by this conception, and apparently would
prefer to treat the subject from the latter point of view.
Possibly they hesitate to make the change because it
breaks with past literature, or possibly because they feel
tlhat under Lhe newer treatment there is not the opportutnity
to use as large a supply of facts relating to the material
world as they think desirable in order to retain the
interest of their readers.
There are two fields for observation: first, the wants
of people, and, second, the things which they want. The
student understands far less in regard to this territory of
wants than the writers appear to take for granted. Authors
admit the importance of the classification and
analysis of the wants. Selecting two recent text-books at
random, from one I read that the question merits long
and careful study; and from the other: A first step is a
clear analysis of the character and motives of the business
man. And yet the first of the writers states that the
general answer to the question, What is the motive:


### ---Economics-1910-0-08.txt---
force? is so simple that it seems almost self-evident, and
the second writes: The motives to business activity are
too familiar to require analysis.
If the present method of exposition is to persist. the
student may well tarry for a longer period than the consideration
of the few pages usually allotted to this topic
demands. It is possible for the student to do practice work
in classifying these wants. In his own experience he has
a laboratory, and by observation he can add other data.
Some of the text-books which are pedagogically provided
with questions recognize in some slight measure the desirability
of this process and the possibility of tindertaking
it. From my point of view the discussion of these
questions, and the procedure to be followed for their
analysis, should at least precede, if not in a large measure
be substituted for, the text which is now given.
Why ask a student whether food, tobacco, medicine,
whiskey, a pack of gambler's cards, or a wooden leg, is
wealth; but rather, who wants food, whiskey, or a
wooden leg? and why, and how much does he want the
given wooden leg? From a consideration of wants alone,
I believe that an extensive tract of economic life could
be surveyed, a survey which would acquaint the student
with a large mass of material arranged under a methodical
scheme; and, what is perhaps of more importance,
the acquaintance of these facts would give vividness and
reality to the subsequent exercise in reasoning.
It will, however, be objected that it is not necessary
to put a student through a prolonged course of wants in
order to undertake the series of rigorous exercises in abstract
reasoning; that observations on the six sacks of
wheat are all that is necessary to grasp the idea of marginal
utility and its related progeny. This may be
granted, though with some doubt; but I assume that the


### ---Economics-1910-0-09.txt---
exponent of abstract reasoning wishes to find some place
for observation and induction. If perchance the instructor
is held up or temnporarily barred from entering
into the higher realm of abstract reasoning, may we not
hope that, though chafing under restraint, he will apply
himself to aiding the student in methods of observation,
classification, and induction, and thus provide an expert
guidance in a difficult art?
My complaint is not confined to those who approach
economics from the standpoint of man's psychical nature,
but includes those who enter from the other gateway and
first view the physical world. Seldom does their guide
take lodgings and acquaint his followers with the features
of the country into whichi they have entered. He
hastens on, stopping at a few traditional stations where
supplies have been stored in advance for another day's
march, but rarely permitting the tourist to stray far
from the personally conducted party. The latter sees
through the eyes of the guide: this is wealth, a beautiful
picture; that is a free economic good, a nmere daub,
not worth seeing; this is competition, a work of Gothic
architecture; that is property, a Roman ruin. And for
tranquil observation of this much, they are often interrupted
because of the insistent messages from their distant
friends who began at the other end of the route and
are urging them to hasten over to view the tropical sights
of man's psychical nature.
What are economic facts? Our students are learned in
defining and analyzing such terms as wages, price, income,
profits, but how many of them know what is a
wage, a price, an income, a profit? But few can distinguish
a strictly accurate price observation. Is it a gross
or net price? Has it a discount or a sub-discount? A spot
cash or time credit price? How large a quantity must be


### ---Economics-1910-0-10.txt---
purchased to secure the price offered? Is it an open price,
or restricted to a certain number of customers? Is it an
artificial or natural price?
A mistake is made in inferring that the observation of
an economic fact is an easy operation. Observation has
only recently been regarded as an indispensable tool of
the natural and physical sciences. But it will be said that
everyone in these days has a wealth of economic information
at his command, and that it is unniecessary to impose
upon the student any special task in observation. A
large number of the so-called facts lose their reality when
translated into the language of the economist. Past experience
appears to count for very little, and the student
must begin to learn the art of observation with a new pair
of glasses to correct the strabismus with which he has
been previously afflicted.
Certain facts are like gold in placer deposits, readily
detected and worked out; others, however, are disguised
and hidden in a composition, and can be extracted only by
ingenious mnethods. As a large part of the gold product
of today is obtained by sulphide and cyanide processes
which involve an expert knowledge of chemical properties,
so an increasing number of facts need to be assayed,
and can be analyzed only by a knowledge of the economic
material in which they lie imbedded. Nor would I imply
that all complex relationships can be disentangled, but
what we ought to insist upon is that the observations we
do rely upon shall be indisputable. To change the figure,
we erroneously take it for granted that our economic
facts are already sorted, neatly arranged in parcels, labeled
and ready to be picked up as they are wanted. For
the great mass of mankind this convenient possession
does not exist. Rather they are scattered about at random,
or heaped up in piles at every conceivable angle;


### ---Economics-1910-0-11.txt---
only the corners of many of them are seen; and if ever
labeled at all, too frequently the labels have been nlisplaced.


Are we not rash in assuming that the concept, competition,
is generally understood? And can it be understood
until we ask who compete, where do the units compete,
or to what degree do they or can they compete? The
term nmonopoly is used as if there were no doubt as to its
implication, and yet few recognize a monopoly when they
meet it face to face in the broad sunlight, and many apply
the term when it has no true significance.
Our observation is governed by our imagination. As
the psychologist observes, one child sees in a stick a
horse; another, a doll; and, we may add, under the influence
of this fancy, creates around this stick anl unreal
world. One observer of a group of economic phenomena
will see an industrial warfare in which each of the units
is endeavoring to exploit his fellows; another in viewing
the same picture beholds a scene of tranquillity in which
each is following his own intent, and realizing his own
individual desires. Each creates an unreality. We would
not destroy the imagination of a child, but fanciful imagination
is not the tool of science. In time the stick becomes
to the child nothing but a stick and is evaluated
as such; but for the adult there is no training which will
dissolve the economic fantasy.
Moreover, exact observation is necessary to serve as
the basis of deduction. If the facts are vitiated, how can
abstract reasoning test its results; how can it dare to attempt
new flights? If Newton had not been able to distinguish
between an apple and a puff-ball, it is probable
that his famous hypothesis would have gone unprovoked.
Imperfect vision is responsible for much of the economic
reasoning associated with schools of propaganda at the


### ---Economics-1910-0-12.txt---
present time. The error of Henry George, socialists, or
extreme individualists is not so much in their reasoning
as in defective observation. Too many of them cannot
distinguish between puff-balls and apples.
At the present time we are interested in currency reform,
an interest largely stimulated by certain phenomena
witnessed in I907. For a satisfactory discussion of this
question there are three elements to be considered: first,
the phenomena of I907, that is, the facts of the panic;
second, the causes; and, third, the remedies. The first is
a matter of observation, the others involve our reasoning
faculty. Do we know the fundamental and elementary
facts which are associated with this panic? One observer
notes that the Hepburn Act was followed by a loss of confidence;
another that it was succeeded by enthusiastic
confidence and unbridled speculation; one observes that
the phenomena of the panic were local, another that they
were international, extending over four continents; one
observes that the currency was inelastic, another that not
for many years had there been so much expansion; one
observes that an excessive amount of wealth had been diverted
to enterprises which were not immediately productive;
another that the amount was not relatively
large; one observes that Wall Street speculation was at a
comparatively low level in the two years preceding October,
1907; another that stock exchange operations were
exceedingly violent; one observes that the panic was the
severest within the memory of man, another that it was
not so disastrous as those of I893 and I873.
Now these are questions of fact; and until these differences
are reconciled and agreement as to what really
happened is attained, how can we profitably busy ourselves
with judgment as to causes or remedies? If we
spent as much time in dissecting the panic of I907 and


### ---Economics-1910-0-13.txt---
noting what really happened in the twelve-month previous
as we do in devising ingenious machinery for establishing
a new currency system, we might perhaps move
more slowly; but later we should at least have the assurance
of knowing what we wish to accomplish.
The complexity of our phenomena appears to defy accurate
observation. There are so many variables that it is
difficult to separate the mass into its compollent parts.
The economist is asked: Is the present increased production
of gold responsible for the advance in prices? and
replies: I do not know; there are so many forces at work
which might affect prices, I cannot be sure which is the
determining cause. A braver answer, and I believe a
more accurate explanation of ignorance would be to attribute
it to inadequate observation. If our knowledge of
past experience was enlarged, and every known instance
of increased prices was observed with simultaneous observations
of demand for commodities; of restricted supply;
of the nature of the commodity which was priced;
of the cost of production, and the volume of money; a
part at least of the error might be eliminated by adopting
the well known rules of logic which other sciences employ,
as the differential method, method of avoidance,
method of compensation, and so on. Great honor is due
to Mr. David A. Wells for attempting single-handed the
solution of this problem by one of the methods indicated,
and the example of his analysis ought to inspire
others to a similar task. As Mill says, "The order of
nature as perceived at a first glance presents a chaos followed
by another chaos." But Mill is not dismayed. He
continues, "We must decompose each chaos into single
facts. We must learn to see in the chaotic antecedent a
multitude of distinct antecedents, in the chaotic consequent
a multitude of distinct consequents."' Nor am I


### ---Economics-1910-0-14.txt---
advancing a plea for the piling up of more facts. Rather,
if it were possible, would I destroy a large part of the
so-called facts the existence of which is in reality an
obstacle to progress. What we want is accurate facts.
Many a monograph is non-usable because the observer
was not trained in observation, did not perceive with clear
vision, and did not record his data with precision.
A host of students are now engaged in the field of descriptive
economics. Some are disposed to think that too
many have been diverted into this field. The mistake of
these ardent workers is not in entering upon this work,
but rather in failing to recognize that it requires a special
preparation,-that it has an art of its own, to observe,
measure, and separate the phenomena which constitute
the object of their research. Possiblv the economist
thinks that he is not concerned with these observational
workmen; but we have a practical situation to meet.
Many are not gifted to engage in abstract reasoning, and
others are not attracted to devote their energies to this
field of intellectual activity. It is impossible to check
this interest, but is it not possible to make the work of
these enthusiastic recruits more effective?
Our subject, however, has another aspect which concerns
the public interest rather than the methods of
pedagogical instruction. As has already been observed,
there is actually existing an enormous amount of observation
in the field of economic activity. The scope of
economic facts is so vast, the data are so scattered, and
the analysis of these facts is so complex, that it cannot be
expected that the task of observation will be carried on by
individual enterprise alone. Much of it is assunmed by
government or subsidized endowment. This has been so
in the past, and must be increasingly so in the future. If
this be true, the only way to secure a scientific supervision


### ---Economics-1910-0-15.txt---
of the process of observation is for governments to put
the work into the hands of scientists, or at least to call
them into consultation. It may be said, however, that
the simple collection of economic facts does not require
the services of experts trained in economic analysis; that
the gathering of data in regard to production, prices, consumption,
etc., demands intelligent and honest administrative
effort, but not necessarily a specialized economist.
The objection is ill-advised; the economist and the sociologist
ought to make their influence felt at every stage
from original observation to final generalization. Because
of this neglect at the initial step, we are now swamped by
a mass of material which in part is rubbish, of no use to
anyone; in another part of so little use that it does not
justify the expense of collection; and which in still another
considerable portion is so inaccurate that it is open
to suspicion, and cannot be safely used for purposes
either of induction or deduction.
Suppose an economist should endeavor to frame a
scheme of facts which he requires for his economic generalization
and processes of reasoning, what facts would
he demand? Under present conditions he has at hand an
enormous mass of material supplied by statistical bureaus
which in order to justify their maintenance are not compelled
to meet an expert demand. They furnish data
which can be easily gathered together, or which will conform
to ideas of serviceability long since abandoned, or
which will make an impressive showing from the standpoint
of quantity. Let the economist go through the
mass of statistical documents and reports of commercial,
industrial, and charitable organizations, and direct his attention
solely to the question,t-in what way can this fact
be used, in what way is it of service, or in what way can
it be analyzed so that it will be of service in- the near future,


### ---Economics-1910-0-16.txt---
how much would receive the mark of approval which
would justify its retention? Is it too much to say that a
considerable part would be passed over? Supply of material
is now furnished under monopoly conditions, and
};ot under the stress of competition,-a force which
quickly discards useless effort. Demand ought to control
the supply, but, as it is, supply mystifies and befogs the
demand. Monopolistic production, generously subsidized,
of all fornms of production requires expert direction.
No one individually is to blame for this condition of affairs.
The fault is in the systemn. The economist has
been living far apart from the official observatories. Busy
with the analysis of motives, psychological effects, gratifications,
welfare subtly conceived as a product of dynamic
forces rather than of static conditions, engrossed
with detecting movements, their direction and significance,
and with the study of differences instead of the
composition and characteristics of the things compared,
he neglects his humble co-workers whose business it is to
record economic phenomena in so far as they admit of
record. The observer has consequently been left to his
own devices; sometimes he is directed by the mandate of
a legislature which rarely seeks expert advice; sometimes
he has been prompted by a passing interest derived from a
newspaper discussion; sometimes by a personal whim.
More frequently he has proceeded along the line of least
resistance, recording data which could be easily secured,
irrespective of any other quality. As a nation we are
altogether too credulous, and have yet to learn that colunms
of figures are not statistics.
In making these statements I would not forget the valuable
work which many bureaus are doing. There is an
increasing tendency on the part of governments, whether
national, state, or local, to call into service trained students


### ---Economics-1910-0-17.txt---
to direct the administration of statistical affairs.
In maniy departments desirable reforms have been effected,
and yet too often somewhere in the administration
of these offices there is a cog missing which makes the
results unsatisfactory. Experts at the top may secure better
methods of interpretation, but they alone cannot secure
correct and accurate observation of the primary data
which are to be interpreted. Attention must be given to
the competency of the field workers, the factory operatives,
in order to justify the laborious inferences of the
experts who use the raw material.
Nor would I appear to slight the intensive and descriptive
studies of those who have made noteworthy contributions
to economic theory. Many of these have observed
to good purpose, as in transportation, taxation, agriculture,
and human vitality. Such activity proves that we
are fortunately supplied with competent directors. It
only remains to organize this potential force so that it
will mark out and conduct an intelligent program whereby
the nation can learn to know itself.

### ---Economics-1911-0-01.txt---
Somewhat more than twenty-five years ago some of us younger
men who were interested in the study and teaching of political
economy in the United States succeeded in organizing this Association.


The quarter of a century which has elapsed since that time has
seen a great change in the standing of the professional economist.
I think it is not too much to say that the voice of the student
of economics as such is today more potent in the United States
in the discussion and decision of public questions than it has ever
been before.

I believe that this greater position of dignity and authority
of the student and professor of economics is, in some degree,
however small, due to the work which this Association, as a body,
has accomplished; although, of course, any position of real
influence or authority which economists as a class may have won
has been due primarily to the actual merit of individual workalso
perhaps in some measure to the increasing willingness of
economic students to let purely abstract or academic questions
drop into the background if thereby some positive practical
advance could be made.
The policy of President Roosevelt and President Taft of selecting
university men, and by way of preference, university men
with economic training, for some of the most important expert
positions at their disposal is a clear demonstration of the changed
attitude of the people of the United States toward the scientific
study of our political problems. And this policy which has been
adopted by the federal government has been followed to a growing
extent in our states and cities. There is a greater willingness
to give the expert a hearing-at any rate, an increasing willingness
to hear all sides of a problem before a decision is made,
which certainly augurs well for the future welfare of the nation.
It is a source of legitimate gratification to us all that so many
memnbers of this Association have been drafted into the public


### ---Economics-1911-0-02.txt---
service. It is a source of still greater satisfaction that they have
all made good in this field of work. Hadley, Emory, Jenks,
Falkner, Rowe, Johnson, Kinley, are mere examples of a growing
tendency which is full of promise for the future of economic studies
and sound public policy.
At the time this Association was organized I felt that in the
interest of economic and social progress there would be a decided
advantage if economists could elaborate and support a positive
program of economic and social advance.
My colleagues with whom I was associated in the preliminary
and final work of organization did not share my views and this
Association has remained, therefore, primarily a scientific body,
pure and simple. I do not know, after all, that it has made any
very great difference, and yet I am still of the opinion today,
as I was then, that if our students of economics and politics and
social science could find any questions of public moment and
interest upon which they are in substantial agreement we might
make a marked contribution to economic and social advance by
taking a definite stand upon such questions of public policy. This
consummation has indeed already been brought about in certain
directions by the organization of specific associations for the study
and promotion of positive economic and social problems; as, for
instance, the Association for Labor Legislation which has grown
out of this Association.
I think, however, that if the members of this Association could
agree, for example (to take a concrete instance), upon the proper
distribution of public and private expenditure in relation to
national production and could work out a definite policy which
would commend itself to the members of the Association, directed
toward securing a more productive distribution of public expenditure,
we might, without doing violence to our scientific character,
produce a marked effect upon public sentiment and in the long run
upon public policy.

For instance, no matter what theory we may have as to the
social effects of war and the political advantage or disadvantage
of settling questions of international scope by force, I think all
students of economics agree that the modern world is -spending an
unreasonably large portion of the national wealth for purposes of
war and preparation for war. No matter how high a value one
may set upon the so-called moral benefits arising from an armed
struggle among different nations to determine the survival of


### ---Economics-1911-0-03.txt---
national ideals-and I know that there are still people who maintain
the moral value of such contests-no matter how high a
value one may set upon the educational discipline which universal
compulsory military service effects in the young men of a nation
which adopts it-and I am aware that there are some very
estimable people who set a high value upon such training-still
I think the overwhelming opinion of the students of economics is
that we have long passed the point at which it is desirable to extend
still further the war budget.
The statement has been made that of late the appropriations
of the federal government are distributed in such a way that nearly
seventy-five per cent may be properly classed as war expenditures,
that is, preparation for war, pensions payable on account of war,
interest on the public debt contracted because of war, etc., etc.
My own estimate runs higher.
Some twenty-five years ago I made a rough estimate of the
expenditures of the federal government up to that time from the
year 1789, covering nearly the first century of our national
existence. I found that the total expenditure for all purposes
on the part of the federal government had been something like
eighteen billions of dollars, and of that amount sixteen and onehalf
billions had been spent for war, using the term again in
its large sense, of money spent in preparation for war, in the
conduct of war, and in settling the bills after the war was over.
In other words, the expenditure of the federal government up
to that time had been sixteen and one-half units for war and one
and one-half for all other purposes whatsoever, including the
so-called enormous expenditures for river and harbor improvement.
Eleven twelfths of the income of the federal government
spent on war!

And this is a peaceful nation!
Nobody can deny that a country which wishes to develop. its
civilization in an efficient way must protect itself from armed
aggression and must maintain domestic order. Everyone will,
furthermore, grant that if we propose, for example, to fortify
our Atlantic and Pacific coasts in such a way that no fleet in the
world could make a landing, it will take very much larger sums of
money than we have thus far spent or have thought of spending
upon war and war's alarms. But it is a long call from admitting
that if we are intending to fortify our coasts in the manner
suggested we must spend far more money than we are spending,


### ---Economics-1911-0-04.txt---
to the proposition that there is any necessity for expending such
sums of money, or for undertaking to fortify our coast at all.
For my part I do not see how anyone who studies American
industry and our international position can help feeling that we
are already spending a larger proportion of our national income
upon preparation for war than is justified by any dangers which
actually threaten us.
Now I believe that if the students of economics would, acting
together, that is, if this Association would persistently, in season
and out of season, call attention to the danger of spending upon
war an undue proportion or our national income, we should be
able to affect very materially, in the course of years, the policy
of the government on this point. This may serve as a mere
illustration of the proposition that fundamental to any large
consideration of practical economic problems and of the actual
conduct of a national economy must be this question of how we
propose to distribute our expenditure, for what purposes we
intend to spend the national wealth which we have once created.
And as I believe that we have thus far spent entirely too much
money in war and for war purposes, so I believe that we have
spent far too little money for education. And it is this problem
which I wish to present to your attention tonight.
The manner of the consumption of wealth has a great and
fundanmental effect upon the production of wealth and upon the
possible increase in the production of wealth. That is, some forms
of consumption are distinctive hindrances to the increase of
wealth and no theory of production, no system of practical politics
can be in any sense complete or satisfactory which does not bear
this fact in mind.

So this evening I desire to discuss somewhat fully, from the
standpoint of practical politics, the effect of a broad scheme of
national education upon the increase of national wealth and what
policy we ought to adopt in regard to it.
The subject of my remarks this evening is, the Economic
Significance of a Comprehensive System of National Education.
I mean by system of national education in this title, a system
of education so extensive in its scope as to reach every child,
and for that matter every adult too, within the bounds of the
United States or in the territory subject to its jurisdiction.
I mean by a comprehensive system of national education, a
system which will excite and develop all sides of the child and


### ---Economics-1911-0-05.txt---
adult, which will call forth and train all the forms of talent and
ability to be found in the children and adults of a great nation.
I mean by the economic significance of such system, the relation
which it would bear to the production of national wealth.
I need not say that no system of national education, in the sense
in which I use it here, has ever existed in the United States.
There are thousands, nay one may say hundreds of thousands,
of children within the United States and within the territory subject
to its jurisdiction who have never been reached by systematic
school eduication of any sort. There are thousands more children
in the United States and in the territory subject to its jurisdiction
who have never had the benefit of any schooling beyond a
mere attempt to bring to them the opportunity to learn, in a feeble
way, the elements of the three R's; and almnost no attempt has
been made to reach in any systematic way, for the purpose of
developing all the talent within its children, the population of
any single state of the American union. Nor has any attempt
worth mention up to the present been made to strengthen and
supplement such elementary education as is brought within the
reach of the young children of the commuinity by a system of
encouraging and sustaininig the further prosecution of the education
of the schools, in later youth and earlier or later adult life.
All economists have recognized, though I think in a very
inadequate way, the importance to the production of national
wealth of the intelligence, knowledge, anid skill of the laborer. It
would be an observation that could scarcely escape the attention
of any student of economy at any period of the world's history
that the more intelligent and better trained the laborer may be,
the more efficient would he be, other things being equal, as an
instrument of production in the general scheme of national economy.
But even these economic writers who have given most
attention to this aspect and have dwelt upon it most fully, seem
to me not to have realized the possibilities for the increase of
national wealth which lie in the increased intelligence, education,
and skill of the laborer. Very few of them have recognized the
extent to which this intelligence, this education, and this skill
may be increased by the conscious taking thought and conscious
action of the community, directed toward this specific end. Still
fewer of them have recognized that an educational system, in this
large sense in which I have used it, may above all be an important
factor in the development of that directing, managerial, initiating


### ---Economics-1911-0-06.txt---
talent which forms such an important element in the system of
national production, and which distinguishes nations and races in
quite as marked a way as the quality of the laborer himself.
I am aware that some authorities are inclined to deny that a
nation may by conscious effort increase the number or the potency
of these fundamental elements of national production. They are
inclined to think that just as the coal, and natural gas, and gold
and silver, and the possibly arable land are things given once for
all, so national talent and national ability are, so to speak, fixed
quantities. A nation cannot materially increase either their
amount or their potency by any conscious effort looking toward
their promotion.

Thus the great Bavarian economist and statistician, Wilhelm
V. Hermann, one of the shrewdest of the German writers on
economics, is very outspoken in his view that no nation can
through its school system or its educational system really increase
greatly the efficiency of its national industry. He says, "wie er
geboren, so ist der Mench sein leben lang :" "As the child is
born so the man remains as long as he lives:" though even he
would allow, I presume, that if we could have caught his grandfather
and trained him and also his father we might have improved
the grandson.

But, I believe that this is a mistaken view. I share the unconscious
feeling which seems to animate the American people to an
ever increasing extent that, by systematic effort, the latent
national ability may be called forth and may be trained to such
an extent as to make the result of such an educational system
essentially different in quality and in kind, and not merely in
quantity, from that which would be the outcome of letting things
take care of themselves.
It seems quite probable that a people like that of the United
States may, by systematic and persistent effort, develop to absolutely
unheard of and undreamed of proportions, the ability of
the nation in all the different directions in which human faculties
may be exerted.

Every student of human civilization must be struck by two
things: first, the large number of different elements which must
conspire together at any one time in order to produce a great
increase in national wealth; and, on the other hand, how few
people after all in the history of the race have really contributed
in any important way to working out the problems upon whose


### ---Economics-1911-0-07.txt---
solution the next great advance in civilization depended. No such
production of national wealth as has occurred within the last
generation could have taken place, of course, without the cooperation
of countless influences reaching back in their development
and origin into the remotest periods of the past. But very
small is the number of men after all who have really contributed
by their scientific discovery, or their inventive genius, in any
important way to this progress. If we could multiply that small
number by two, or three, or four, or five, or ten, or a hundredas
might easily be done if we were to adopt a system of education
which will discover, call forth, and train all the talent of the
community to its highest efficiency-the progress of civilization
would be correspondingly hastened. The human race has spent
such a large part of its total wealth in war that we have little
idea as to the enormous progress that might be achieved if the
energy and attention of the race could be turned as fully and completely
toward this problem of developing the race on the side
of its industrial talents as it has been turned to the work of
destruction.

This progress does not always seem rapid. The race, of course,
must have time to develop, must have time to grow, in order to
be capable of the intellectual effort, nay even of the prolonged
physical effort, involved in the production of such enormous
quantities of material wealth as have been produced within the
last century. It is inconceivable that the African or the American
Indian, as Columbus knew him, or generally speaking any barbarous
peoples, should develop within a generation or even two
generations those particular qualities to that particular extent
which are necessary to develop and maintain a high degree of
civilization. The mere qualities of endurance, or persistence, of
imagination, necessary to enable the civilized man to continue
at even the rudest of civilized occupations long enough to work
out their natural results are lacking to the barbarian.
Now, of course, it is undoubtedly true that the possibilities of
any system of education are strictly limited by these fundamental
facts founded in the nature of individuals and of races. But,
given the civilized white or yellow man as we know him today,
as the result of countless generations of ever expanding civilizations,
my proposition is that such a nation can, by a conscious
effort, increase to a very great extent the production of national


### ---Economics-1911-0-08.txt---
wealth, by discovering, developing, and training the productive
ability of its population.
The American people have been much concerned of late about
the coinservation of their natural resources, and they may well be
thus exercised. Waste represents an absolute loss in the human
economy. There is no doubt that we have permitted the national
wealth of the country to be exploited in an uneconomical way
in many directions, owing to the greed, or shortsightedness, or
both, of private interests. This exploitation has steadily been
accompanied at many points by waste. Waste is, economically
speaking, a sin for which there is no pardon. Its penalty must be
borne either by the people who are guilty of it, or by those who
succeed them, and the American people has undoubtedly been
wasteful in the exploitation of its natural resources. We have
mined our coal oftentimes in such a way as to destroy forever the
value of a large part of it. We have allowed our natural gas in
great quantities to escape into the atmosphere or be burned as it
camne fromii the bowels of the earth, with no resulting economic
gain. We have undoubtedly used at niany points wasteful methods
in the cutting off of our forests, and have failed to observe that
the larger interest of the community as a whole demanded a
greater care in the removal of our tinmber wealth.
But after all, the mere preservation of natural resources is not
in any proper sense of that term a conservation of natural re-
-sources, that is, such a care of the natural resources as will work
out the largest economic result. The American Indian had preserved
the natural resources of the North American continent
up to the coming of Christopher Columbus, and for anything that
we can see would have preserved themn for countless generations.
The Mexican peon still preserves the natural resources of great
stretches of the most fertile Mexican territory. The savages of
Africa, and generally speaking of all countries, preserve the
natural resources; but we can hardly speak of them as conserving
them in any proper sense.
There will naturally be great differences of opinion as to whether
any particular policy in exploiting the forests or the mines or the
fields is, economically speaking, wasteful or not. That which
seems to be wasteful at one time and under one set of conditions
may be the height of economy under other conditions. The lavish
use of natural resources may in some places be the condition of
developing a civilization which may subsequently find it necessary


### ---Economics-1911-0-09.txt---
to adopt entirely new principles of management, if its system of
exploitation is to be as economical as was the formler.
However, no matter how liberal we may be in permitting to
count as true economy the lavish use of natural resources in the
(levelopment of a civilization, I think there is general agreement
after all among students of the subject that the people of the
United States have at many points been wasteful in the true sense
of that term, namely, in producing their sum total of national
wealth at a cost beyond what would lhave beeni occasionedl if a
better systein of exploitation had been adopted.
But with this concession, I desire to emphasize again what
seems to me to be the fact in the case, that the discovery,
development, and training of the talents and abilities of our people
is of far more significance to the continued and increasing production
of national wealth than is the so-called conservation
policy, important as that is. We may fairly enough, if we are
wise in our day and generation, through the increasing intelligence
of our people, develop the conditions of an increase of national
wealth far more rapidly than we are losing them through the
exploitation of our natural resources.
I have myself never been able to become excited over the
demonstrations which are afforded from time to time that the
human race is destined ultimately to poverty and despair because
of the exhaustion of our coal fields.
We certainly should not waste our coals in the sense of using
them up with nothing to show for such use. But, on the other
hand, the proposition to preserve the coal which we may profitably
use now in the development of industry or increasing the comfort
of humanity because we are afraid that our posterity may suffer
from cold or hunger, would seem to me to be absurd. I believe
that if the race were to give its attention steadily to the scientific
and practical investigation of means of laying under direct contribution
the energy of the sun, of the falling water, the flowving
stream, the sweeping tides, the rushing winds,-I say if the race
would spend a tithe of the money upon the studv of that problem
which it has given to the study of the means of destroying its
members, we might safely proceed to use up our coal fields to the
last ton, relying upon our abilitv in the long run to discover
adequate-nay more than adequate-substitutes for the energy
and light and heat pent up in this wonderful storehouse of nature.
The same thing is true in regard to the exploitation of the


### ---Economics-1911-0-10.txt---
soils. We have not as yet reached an ultimate judgment as to tht
conditions of soil fertility, or as to the conditions under which
the productivity of soils is maintained or destroyed. We have
found out a few things in this respect, but the world of what we do
not know is so much larger than the world of what we know that
for my part I have never been able to feel that extreme anxiety
in regard to the depletion of our soils that many of my colleagues
who are engaged in the study of soil chemistry and soil physics
and soil biology have thus far felt. There is doubtless such a
thing as ruining the soil. There is such a policy as the ruinous
exploitation of the natural qualities and resources of the soil;
but I have a firm belief that if the nation, or the race, would
give its attention and its thought as seriously to the problems
of soil fertility as it has to problems connected with the
army and navy we should find ways and means of increasing our
crops while protecting and restoring the fertility of soils which
at present are quite beyond the possibility of even our imagination.
In the same way, while we are undoubtedly guilty of great waste
in the exploitation of our stores of iron, and such waste ought to
be stopped, yet I have full confidence that if we should give
thought and attention and money to scientific investigation directed
along right lines we should find some substitute for iron fully
as efficient and fully as helpful as iron itself, long before it should
fail us. And the same thing is true to a greater or less extent of
all our national resources.
I am aware that this view of human progress is scouted by
many as lacking substantial proof of its correctness, as mere
nonsense and the stuff that dreams are made of; and it is fortunately
not necessary for me, in order to make my point, to demonstrate
the full truth of the proposition, since all that is requisite
for my present purpose is to secure your consent to the proposition
that we may materially increase the conditions of national
wealth by a properly considered educational policy.
That the skill and intelligence of the average laboring man
in the United States were greatly increased by the astonishing
development of our elementary and secondary school system during
the years following the war must, I think, be conceded by any
student of our national history. And yet that education was very
largely limited to giving the rudiments of an English education,
such as reading, writing, and ciphering-and that not to all by
any means.


### ---Economics-1911-0-11.txt---
When our secondary school was developed, though at first
very narrow in its scope, it accomplished even more striking results,
because it helped develop the directing talent in the community.
A system of national education having in view the objects
which I have suggested must include, speaking generally, for the
people who remain in school, two elements, which for purposes of
discrimination we may generallv describe as the liberal and technical
elements. Under the head of the liberal element I should
include those fundamental features such as reading, writing, and
ciphering, which are the keys, so to speak, to the experience of the
race. But I should not by any means limit the scope of this instruction
to these three R's, for it is certain that one of the fundamental
objects of a national system of education can never be
realized unless the range of instruction in the elementary school
far exceeds these so-called fundamentals. Certainly one of the
purposes of any system of education must be to discover the
talents of the child, must be to find out in what way, that is, by the
special development of what faculties, he may do his greatest service
to his day and generation. Some men make their most important
contribution as ditch diggers, as farm hands, as mechanics
in the mills; others as directors in these occupations; still others
as artists, teachers, lawyers, or physicians. A national system of
education ought to find out the peculiar abilities of the child and
put him in a way to develop them. This means, of course, that
among the so-called fads, drawing and singing and a wide range
of art work, should be represented in the elementary school as
well as the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, geography
and history and science.
But no child can afford to spend even the first twelve years
of his life without coming in contact with some kind of training of
the body and training of the mind which touches in some direct
way the possibilities of his future occupations; and so manual
training and domestic science, at least in their rudiments, must
form a part of this fundamental, this common instruction which
all children should have. That is to say, when our compulsory
school laws are universal and really enforced, the school will have
before it the problem of occupying in the best way from seven to
eight years of the pupil's life; and in this time every child, not
merely the white children, but the colored children as well; not
merely the citizens of Massachusettts and New York, but those of
Alabama and Louisiana; not merely the children of Ohio and


### ---Economics-1911-0-12.txt---
Illinois, but those of the mountain regions of the South and those
of the semideserted portions of the older states, shall without exception
have access to these opportunities.
But a national system of education will include, furthermore,
foi every child, an opportunity for technical, special training,
looking forward to the career which the child is expecting to take
iup or which his parents are planning for him. This means in a
large sense-and why should we hesitate today to speak it out
bol(dly-a system of trade schools, a system of occupation schools
so universal, so comprehensive, varying, of course, in character
witlh the conditions in the different localities, that every child
shall have the chance to prepare himself more efficiently for his
life work in a trade or other occupation.
It is national waste of the first magnitude to turn children into
the avenues of trades and commerce and industry in this great
niation today without some of that kind of training for such work,
which the school best of all can give. The apprentice system,
as you all know, in the old form, if it ever was the ideal thing
which it was supposed to be-and for my part I can find no
evidence that it was-has at any rate today gone to pieces. The
children of the communiity do not have a fair opportunitv to
prepare themselves on the technical side for efficient work. A
portion of this preparation, moreover, can be best given for nearly
every occupation in the school, and that portion should be the
heritage of every child.
But hundreds of thousands of children must, as a matter of
fact, under our present economic conditions, go directly and
imnmnediately from the compulsory school period into the process of
earning a living. And the demands of industry are such as to take
practicallv all the time and strength of these young people from
the very moment of assuming this new burden.
It lies in the interest of the community, looking upon these
children as mere instruments of production, regarding them as
mere means of increasing the national wealth, to see that conditions
are such as to make them ever more efficient elements in our
scheme of national production. This means that the school system
must provide some systematic, continuation school opportunities;
and if necessary that the laws regulating the labor of youth shall
be so changed as to provide an opportunity for all young people,
from the completion of the compulsory school age and for at least
two or three years after, a chance to get that benfit which comes


### ---Economics-1911-0-13.txt---
from the assistance which a well organized school agency can bring
to them, in the form of definite school instruction. This means,
of course, a radical and pronounced, and withal expensive, addition
to our educational system.
I would not have you understand that I believe that a systematic
school education is the only training of value for the youth of a
country in preparing them for their work as productive agencies.
Far be it from me to maintain any such proposition. I have seen
many cases of children who in my opinion would have learned
far more on the farm, in the shop, and in the office than they were
learning at school. On the other hand, there is not a single
occupation which requires skill, industry, and strength, in the
training for which the school, if properly conducted, cannot contribute
a more efficient element than any other agency at work
niow in our society; and my proposition is that our educational
system be so organized that this element can be introduced into
our school system in the first place, and into our industrial system
in the second place.
What I have said thus far in regard to the elements which
enter into a comprehensive system of national education, applies
to all modern nations alike,- to England, France, and Germany,
to every civilized country of Europe or of Asia.
But this is especially true in the United States today. We are
trying to be a republic. We are trying to develop a democratic
state. We are far from having reached any such consummation,
but at any rate we are working toward it; and with every passing
decade I believe we are making some progress in spots; and if in
some places there seems to be deterioration or retrogression, owing
to peculiar circumstances, yet in others there are evident signs of
rapid evolution toward higher things.
Now no state can, politically speaking, be a true democracy,
unless it has also become a true democracy industrially speaking;
and one of the elements of a true democracy, industrially speaking,
is an opportunity for every child to develop the industrial capacities
within him to the very highest possible extent. This cannot
be done unless aside from his fundamental education involved in
the three R's, and the things wlhich go with them, is also given a
chance for the acquirement of technical skill in connection with
intellectual development, so that a combination of industrial facility
with a developing brain and a developed body may be effected.
Such a system of education is especially necessary in the United


### ---Economics-1911-0-14.txt---
States today because of the terrific strain to which our institutions
and our life are being subjected by the enormous immigration into
our body politic and body social from nearly every land under the
sun.

We do not yet know very much about the effect of the mixture
of nationalities upon national progress. We do not even know
enough about the laws of biology to determine whether the outcome
of such a mi4ture will be good or bad; but one thing I think we can
be perfectly sure of, and that is that the inpouring of these
enormous masses of people of such varying intellectual standards;
of such varying ideals, political, social, and religious; of such
physical differences-must threaten in the most marked way the
ideals and practices and institutions of this great republic. The
ultimate outcome may be good, for I am one of those who recognize
very distinctly that the ideals of some of these immigrants are in
certain directions higher than our own; that they are bringing
to us qualities in which we are defective; and I have great hope
that, in the long run, great good will come out of this accession
to our ranks. But in the meantime everything threatens to become
more or less unstable. It becomes more difficult to forecast
what is going to happen under a given set of conditions; and in
all this development a comprehensive system of national education
is needed, a system which will take hold of everyone of these
foreigners and of his children and work them over and digest
them, so to speak, make American citizens of them, enable them to
comprehend our history and our ideals, help them to appreciate
our standards, and, if theirs are higher than ours, help them to
make these effective. In all this work nothing is for an instant to
be compared in effectiveness to such an educational system as I
have been outlining, a system which will actually take hold of
every child; will give him the elements of a common education, and
will train him for efficiency in American life and industry.
Friends, we are very prone to brag on our educational system
and our great facilities, but it does not do for us to close our
eyes to certain plain and simple facts; and on such an occasion
as this we ought to consider them with care. The fact is that
no civilized nation has within its midst any population of equal
numbers so sunk in ignorance, so beyond the reach of modern
educational influences, as the negro population of the United
States, particularly in those sections where, owing to their numbers,
they practically become a dominating element,-not dominating


### ---Economics-1911-0-15.txt---
in the sense that they formally control, but dominating in
the sense that the whole social and educational and industrial
policy must turn around them, and reckon with the facts of their
intellectual and moral development.
The industrial training of the Southern negro is one of the
fundamnental national needs of this great country. But it isn't
a thing which inerely concerns Louisiana or Alabama or Georgia
or Carolina. It is something which affects the interest of every
part of this great nation.
Owing to social conditions it is necessary for the South to
provide two entirely different, distinct, though parallel, educationial
systems. Now it is simply impossible for the Southern
people to provide two efficient systems of education. The burden
is too great. The nation ought not to ask it of it. The nation
ought to insist that this problem be taken up and solved, but it
ought to be willing to help bear the burden of its solution.
But aside from the negroes, I think it is also safe to say that
there is no population of equal promise, of equal abilities, so
devoid of educational facilities in any large civilized country as
are the mountain whites along the Appalachian Mountain chain,
and into the valleys and over the mountains of that great region.
Here is a popul.-,Ji n of extraordinary value from an industrial
poinit of view, if it were made available for national development.
The men whom these people have contributed to the life of America
are an illustration of the wonderful stores of unused ability
uipon which the nation has not drawn at all. It would be a good
investment for the United States of America as a nation to put
tat national expense into this region an efficient educational system,
even if the states concerned did not contribute a single dollar to it.
The educational condition of the Southern negro, the educational
condition of certain portions of the Southern whites, is a
reproach to the American nation.
But these two striking cases do not by any means exhaust the
illustrations of my proposition. In manv respects, in spite of
all our great development, in spite of our growth, of which we
may be proud, we are still lagging behind not only our own
possibilities, but the actual achievements of other nations. The
rural schools over a large extent of the wealthy Northern States
are taught by a more uneducated and a more inexperienced class
of teachers than would be accepted as satisfactory instructors of
the young either in England, France, or Germany. And even if


### ---Economics-1911-0-16.txt---
we go into our large cities, under the most favorable conditions,
we shall find that we have only begun to make progress in the
direction of the technical training of our youthful population,
which I have indicated as a necessary element in such a scheme of
education as I have proposed.
Now my next proposition is that a system of education which
is to accomplish the things I have sketched out, and really become
effective in this large sense for an increase in national production,
must be national in scope. That is, it must reach everybody
throughout the entire extent of national territory. It must be
national in its support, that is, the nation must assist in carrying
the burdens of such a scheme, and not leave it altogether to the
locality or the state; and it must be national in its ideals. In other
words, it must have before itself as animating it, underlying it,
permeating it, crowning it, if you will, the idea of developing to
the highest possible extent the nation whose instrumentality it is.
We have thus far, with some exceptions which I shall note later,
depended for the evolution of our educational system largely upon
the good will and public spirit of private benefactors, God bless
their names! and upon the more or less haphazard inclination of
localities or states, spurred on in certain directions as they have
been by national legislation.
Now we cannot safely rely upon the desire of the local community
to work out an adequate educational system. Our history
has shown that there have been whole states, which for long
periods of time, have done absolutely nothing toward the development
of an adequate educational system. There are today communities
in every American state which, if they were permitted
by law to do so, would practically abolish even the elementary
school, which gives the modicum of opportunities, characteristic
of a backward, one-room country school. We must as a nation
have a definite policy looking toward the development of our
educational facilities, if we are within our day and generation
to see results at all commensurate with what would be perfectly
possible under the inspiration and working of such a system.
It is furthermore not fair to insist that the locality or even
the state shall bear the entire burden of such an educational
system. There is no function which has been thus far left or
delegated to the locality or to the state more truly national in
its scope than is education. The remotest school district in the
mountains of Georgia or Tenne-ssee may by great sacrifice support


### ---Economics-1911-0-17.txt---
a school in which some of the brighest children of their generation
shall be educated, children who on growing to maturity move
away into some other district, some other country, some other
state, and bring into the particular locality in which they may
finally settle all the advantages which this educational process
has brought to thenm. How many of our western cities have grown
strong because of able and educated men who have come into them
fromn the districts of New York or New England! How large a
part of the funds of the New England country schools for the last
fifty years have gone for the education of men whose contribution
to the locality in which they lived and to the nation came not
through New England at all, but through Illinois, and Wisconsin,
an(l Minnesota! In fact no one can tell what particular portion
of the country will profit most by the fact that the people in
some remote school district of Pennsylvania have taxed themselves
to the limit for the purpose of training in the best possible way
the children of that district. One may safely say that in all
probability the chief advantage would rather accrue to some other
district than to that which made the sacrifices. Now as long as
that is true, here is a logical, or ethical, reason, if you please, why
a part of the expense of the local school and the local school
system shall be borne by the nation.
This would be still truer of this comprehensive system of
national education which I have been discussing; for in proportion
as the expense increases, in proportion as the service of the school
becomes larger, in proportion as it serves a greater range of
human ability, does this principle which I have referred to hold
good, that the results of this training accrue, in all probability,
to the advantage of some other locality, some other state, some
other section of the country.
There is another reason already noted in the case of the South
why the nation must assist in the development and support of
the kind of system which I have been describing, and that is the
simple one that many of the localities, many of the states, cannot
of themselves raise the necessary funds to establish, develop, and
maintain such a system of education. There are many sections
of even the wealthiest portions of the country, the states north
of Mason and Dixon's line and east of the Rocky Mountains and
beyond the Cascade range, many localities which without the aid
of the state, in large measure, could not possibly undertake to
raise the funds by anv reasonable system of revenue open to them,


### ---Economics-1911-0-18.txt---
which would be necessary for this kind of an educational system.
To the federal government was assigned when it was organized
many of the most fruitful sources of revenue. To the states were
left many of the most burdensome items of expenditure. The
nation may, by a national revenue system, raise certain funds
far more easily, with less burden to the individual and less burden
to industry, than they can be raised either by the state or the community.
A reasonable distribution, therefore, of public burdens
between the state and the nation would call for such a readjustment
of the burdens of this educational function conceived in this larger
way.

The locality should do its part; the state should do its part;
the nation should do its part, toward raising funds necessary to
maintain this comprehensive system of national education.
There is another reason, an important one too, why the nation
should make its contribution to this educational function; and
that is that as education is in essence a national function, so
it ought to find a corresponding external recognition of that fact
in the national budget. In this wav education becomes the subject
of national discussion. It assumes gradually the relative importance
which it ought to occupy as a national issue in the minds of
men. And when the subject of education and what the nation
ought to do for it becomes the topic of congressional debate, and
when once a year the question is raised how much the federal
government is contributing or ought to contribute towards this
purpose, when the question is discussed how efficiently this money
is used, we gradually secure from the public that attention to the
importance of education as a fundamental national issue which
can comne in no other way. In England, France, Germany, and
now in all the other civilized countries including Russia, education
has become a national issue. The platforms of great political
parties are carefully examined by the thoughtful portion of the
community, to see whether they propose to provide adequate
assistance for the support of education; and in Germany practically
the same thing is effected by the fact that Prussia is so
overwhelmingly the German Empire that the discussion of educational
questions in the Prussian diet attract almost the same
attention that they would in the Imperial diet itself.
Now one may raise the question, what is a practical plan, and
what do you propose as a positive concrete step which may be
taken in this direction?


### ---Economics-1911-0-19.txt---
My proposition is very simple: that the federal government
shall grant to each state in the Union a sum of money equal to one
dollar per annum per head of its population for the support of
elementary and secondary education, that is, for the common
schools; and that this money shall be expended for the purpose
of strengthening what, for lack of a better term, we may call
"practical" education, that is, in agriculture, the mechanic arts,
the trades, domestic science, commerce and business, etc.
This would represent a contribution from the federal treasury
toward the support of elementary and secondary education of
approximately one hundred million dollars a year,-less than the
amount given to the building of a navy, far less than the amount
given to general military purposes, a sum which many people
would think so small as compared with the expense of such an
educational system as this that it would hardly be effective in a
large way.

Now the objections to a proposed grant of this kind are
obvious and potent. That they are really potent is evident enough
by the fact that in spite of more or less discussion of this subject
for fifty years past we have not yet made any verv great progress
toward bringing it to pass. The first argument which naturally
suggests itself is that education is not a federal function. If by
this is meant that the constitution of the United States does not
mention the support of elementary and secondary education as
one of the functions of the federal government, there would be,
of course, no discussion. If, however, is meant that this is not
properly a function of the federal government, that is surely
begging the question, since that is one of the points to be established.
I think the argument which I have made as to its necessity
for the national welfare, as to the national benefit from the
education of every individual child along the lines I have suggested,
and the impossibility of securing the benefits of this
education to the communities which have had to bear the expense,
is a satisfactory answer.
It may be said, moreover, that the federal government from the
very beginning of its existence has looked upon education as in
a peculiar sense something which the federal power must, within
the limits within which it was content to act, have a special regard
for. You will remember the famous declaration involved in the
ordinance of 1787 in which Congress declared that the promotion
of education was one of the fundamental purposes of government.


### ---Economics-1911-0-20.txt---
When later this territory was divided into states, the federal
government gave, from lands which belonged to it, large endowments
for the purpose of assisting the localities in the further
development of the schools and for the purpose of stimulating local
and state activity in the direction of developing and supporting
schools. The federal government continued later this same policy
of large endowment of education within the states by these grants
of federal land; and finally in the later legislation it did not content
itself with giving these lands to the states for the purpose of
education, but it made it a condition of admission of these states
to the Union that they should administer these funds for this
purpose and for no other.
I think it is beyond doubt that the policy of the federal
government, in thus granting to these newer states these federal
lands, has brought about the wonderful developments in popular
education which we have thus far achieved in this great Mississippi
Valley and in the states beyond the mountains. It was not merely,
as I have suggested before, because these lands were given to start
these schools, for in many cases the states in the first instance,
not being inclined to education, dissipated these funds, used them
for other purposes, and covered themselves with disgrace for the
flagrant way in which they disregarded the implicit pledges involved
in the acceptance of these lands for educational purposes.
But still more than the positive support which these lands gave
to common school education was the stimulus, was the example,
held continually before the minds of the community, set by the
federal government, of giving a portion and a considerable portion
of the public wealth to these purposes. It was a constant reproach
to the people of any state who dissipated these funds or
used them for other purposes, that the federal government had
set apart these lands out of the territory of the nation for public
education. The example was a constant challenge to the people
of every state that they should also give attention to these same
questions, and that as their wealth and strength increased they
should develop ever more strongly and completely this system of
popular education.

On the whole they have done so. The dav of squandering these
great endowments of education has passed away, though in every
state where this fund is great the public must safeguard its interest
with great watchfulness.
But the federal government was not content with giving these


### ---Economics-1911-0-21.txt---
lands to the states for elementary education. It went farther.
It gave to each of the states certain lands for the development of
hiigher education, the so-called college and seminary funds.
Finally, after long discussion and long agitation stretching
over more than thirty years, the federal government in the year
1862 granted to each state in the Union thirty thousand acres of
land for each senator and representative in the federal congress
for the purpose of establishing in each state a college for the
promotion of agriculture and the mechanic arts. This was
a grant not merely of public lands to the states within which the
public lands were located, but it was a grant to each state in the
Union permitting it to locate its lands where it best could under
the provisions of the law.
A generation passed away and the federal government appropriated
in cash to each state in the Union, March 2, 1887, the
sum of fifteen thousand dollars for the development of an agricultural
experiment station, this money to be paid out of the
proceeds of the sale of public lands. Only three years later,
August 30, 1890, the federal government returned to the same
proposition and then for the first time, with the utmost directness,
it appropriated money from the federal treasury for the support
of these colleges, out of funds not otherwise appropriated. And
thus, in form as well as in reality, the federal government has
committed itself to the proposition of supporting higher education
along practical lines, out of the federal treasury, within the
limits and under the auspices of the states.
This has turned out to be one of the greatest endowments
of higher education ever made by any government. And it has
turned out, I believe, to be one of the most beneficent series of
grants made by any country in the support of higher education.
And it has demonstrated several things. First, that a comparatively
small grant from the federal government for a given educational
purpose, so far from laming local effort or local initiative,
will greatly stimulate the efforts of localities and of states to
develop still further the education which is thus endowed.
According to the last report of the United States Bureau of
Education, sixty-nine institutions were receiving the benefits of this
congressional appropriation. The total appropriation made by
the federal government, exclusive of that for the agricultural
experiment stations, was somewhat less than two million dollars
per year. The total expenditure of these institutions was over


### ---Economics-1911-0-22.txt---
eighteen millions of dollars. In other words, for every dollar
given by the federal government the states have contributed,
roughly speaking, eight dollars in addition. A more striking illustration
of the stimulating effect of a wise grant of public money
for a definite purpose has, I think, rarely been afforded.
The contribution of this system of schools to the wealth of this
country is something which can hardly be estimated. It has first
of all trained the youth of the country for practical occupation
in the field of agriculture and engineering in such a wav as to
raise the level of the practice of these professions throughout the
United States.

It has also contributed very greatly in addition to our knowledge
of the conditions under which a productive agriculture and
a productive industry may be developed. It has been estimated
that the benefits of the discoveries emanating from these centers
of agricultural and engineering education has been such as to give
a positive increase in national wealth in every single year larger
than the total cost of all these institutions from the beginning to
the present.

Surely in the light of these facts it cannot be said that, practically
speaking, education has not been recognized as a function
of the federal government. As a matter of fact, it has been so
recognized to such an extent as to establish the principle beyond
question.

But after all, the federal government has done comparatively
little aside from the land grants-which, it is true, were an
important contribution-to stimulate, or aid in, the support of
elementary or secondary education. It is interesting to note that
this grant on the part of the federal government to higher education
was supplementary to the work which was doing in the states
themselves in this field. It did not undertake to endow the American
college of the traditional type or to endow professional
education. The men who were behind this measure seemed to
think that those particular phases of national education would
take care of themselves. The grant was made definitely for the
purpose of developing the practical side of higher education, of
training for callings and professions for which no training had
been, up to that time, provided in the educational system, either
public or private.

This was a wise measure. First of all it was a strategic move
to ask the federal government to give money in aid of education


### ---Economics-1911-0-23.txt---
in a field in which education had been sadly neglected and in which
it was not likely to be developed within any time which men could
foresee, unless the federal government gave this aid.
The same thing is today a strategic move, namely, we should
ask for this money from the federal government for the purpose of
developing the practical side of education in our elementary and
secondary schools. It should be strictlv a supplemental grant,
in aid of this work, not an attempt to assume the responsibility
of its entire support.
There is little doubt that if such a grant were made it would
stimulate the development of elementary and secondary education
along the lines thus far suggested, in a remarkable way and with
more astonishing results than have been accomplished in the field
of higher education. To accomplish this result of stimulation,
it is not necessary that the federal government should assume
the entire burden, or that it should do more than pay the comparatively
small part of what would ultimately be its share of the
expense.

One other objection, of course, to this kind of proposition
is very commonly made and occurs to everyone. Will not such a
scheme as this strengthen enormously the tendencies which are
making for centralization in the United States? Will it not
strengthen greatly the power of the federal government and diminish
still more the activity and energy and initiative of the commonwealths
themselves?

The proposition is that this money be given to the states to be
expended by them for this purpose. Of course it would be necessary
to utilize that amount of federal-I will not call it supervision
for it is not that-but federal bookkeeping which would
make sure that this money given for this purpose should be used
by the states for the purpose for which it is given. Otherwise
it should be left entirely to the states to manage, as the law has
left it to the states to determine the manner in which the funds
shall be expended which were granted for the colleges of agriculture
and the mechanic arts.
That such a measure would enlarge the view of the federal
government, so to speak; that it would bring into the range of
federal thought and federal activity the subject of education in a
large way, there is no doubt; and that is one of the strongest
arguments in its favor. If this appropriation of federal funds
in aid of elementary and secondary education were incidentally to


### ---Economics-1911-0-24.txt---
become so large as to diminish somewhat the amount of money
wastefully spent upon so-called internal improvements, or if it
would diminish or at least call a halt to the increasing expenditures
for the army and the navy, this to my mind would be an additional
reason for the adoption of such a plan.
You will remember that we had twenty-five years ago a similar
proposition before the federal government, known as the Blair bill,
under which it was proposed to distribute fifty millions of dollars
to the states in aid of elementary and secondary education. I
was a warm advocate of that proposition at that time and I
had a good illustration not long ago of how the deeds of men live
after them, when in an eastern paper some reference was made to
me as that crank who had urged the adoption of the Blair bill.'
I remember a conference which I had during that time with
Mr. Godkin, the editor of the New York NVation, one of the most
trenchant political writers of the time, and one who was opposed
to the appropriation contemplated by the Blair bill. He objected
that the national expenditure had already run to such limits as
to threaten national bankruptcy, and that the nation could not
undertake such additional expenditure of this sort without seriously
impairing national credit. I urged upon his attention an
entirely different veiw, namely, that we might determine, to some
extent, if we took hold of the matter in earnest, the distribution
of national expenditure. We might determine that some of it
should be spent for education instead of having it all spent for
war; but that the circumstances of the time indicated as clearly
as anything could that expenditure was bound to increase, and
no amount of effort was going to prevent a large and continuous
increase. We might, by taking thought, get those larger expenditures
made on behalf of important things, but if we did
not do that the expenditures would go for impossible harbors,


### ---Economics-1911-0-25.txt---
and still more impossible rivers; would go for manufacturing
cannon which woul(d rust out and become worthless before they
should ever be used; would be spent in inaugurating a "world
policy" which was sure to come if the nation continued so great
and the revenue continued to grow.
I believe the same thing.is true today. One of the arguments,
in my mind, for the assumption of a part of the burden of national
education by the federal government is that if the federal government
assists more fully in bearing the burdens of the nation as
it ought to, it will not be tempted to add increased burdens to
the nation by wild policies of world adventure, to which it will
be tempted in ever increasing extent, as national revenue and
therefore the possibility of such interference increases.
Friends, if we could secure the establishment in our day and
generation of such a comprehensive system of national education
-namely, one which would reach every child, white, black, yellow,
rich, and poor, and discover and call forth all his capabilitiesand
then a system which would go farther and privide for the
training of those abilities to the highest possible point, the nation
would enter upon a period of increase of national wealth the like
of which has never been seen in the history of the world. When all
the abilities of the community have an opportunity to be developed
and to be employed in the service of the community and in the
development of civilization; when the attention of the nation is
concentrated upon the development of its own people first of all,
and not upon world domination, not upon world influence, not even
primarily upon world service, but upon the development of its own
people and their capacities; then we shall see a new heaven and a
new earth; and when we set before ourselves as a nation the problem
of developing the bodies, the brains, and the character of our
children to the highest degree of perfection, all these other things
national wealth, world influence, and world power-shall be
added unto us.

is at a disadvantage as compared with many of the natural
sciences, in that it does not admit of laboratory experiments.
There are two considerations which support this assumption.
In the first place economics deals with human beings in their
social relations. It does not even deal with them as individuals.
It must therefore consider large groups, often whole states or
groups of states. The economist has neither the power to force,
nor the wealth to pay for, experiments upon nations, and if he
had, he would in many cases be deterred by moral scruples from
attempting them. Such a power might conceivably be exercised
by some oriental despot, and such persons have existed. Herod,
the son of Antipater, for example, if he had been as much interested
in sociology as he was in politics, would have made a good experimenter,
since he was not only able but quite willing to put to death
all of the children born within a certain time in Bethlehem.
Tughlak, the son of Muhammed, who ruled Northern India from
1324 to 1351, is in the same class. He has been described as
"learned, merciless, religious and mad." He was thus equipped
morally and mentally as well as politically for trying social experiments
on a large scale. And he did so. For we are told that he
"tried to replenish his treasury by the simple expedient of coining
brass in vast quantities and ordaining that it should be accepted
as silver."' He thus decreed that the King's brass should be
equal to the people's silver, and doubtless introduced among his
people the familiar phenomena of an inflated currency.
But Herod and Tughlak represent past types. The modern
economist, even if he were at the same time a great statesman,
could not deliberately experiment on a nation without running the
risk of being committed either to an insane asylum or a jail. And
yet the really important thing for the economist is that experiments
be tried, not that he try them himself, and in view of the
great cost of social laboratory work the economist is really fortunate
in having experiments tried for him without expense to


### ---Economics-1912-0-02.txt---
himself and without involving him in any legal or moral liability.
He cannot, it is true, like Herod, kill off the babies for the sake
of watching the effect upon population or wealth, but society is
constantly creating by law conditions which lead to the slauighter
both of innocents and of adults, by preventable disease and accident.
In many cases this needless increase of the death rate is
brought about, as it was in the time of Herod, because our office
holders are more intent upon keeping their jobs than upon earning
their salaries, and care more for politics than for sociology. We
lhave in a republic no despot to force his brass into circulation,
but what no despot would dare do to the people, the sovereign
people cheerfully do to themselves. When our country was
livided by a civil war, the hostile sections, though bitterly opposed
to each other in most questions, were yet alike in that each decreed
to make the government's paper equal to the people's gold, and
tried over again the experiment of an inflated currency which had
been tried by Tughlak, the son of Muhammed, and by many
others after him.

Thus we not only have experiments tried on a large scale in
modern states, but it is fair to say that, the more democratic the
country, the more ready on the whole it is to try experiments on
itself. Thus economic experimentation is not only possible, but
it is so common that it is hardly recognized as experimentation,
and the superabundant legislative activity of so many of our
advanced and radical commonwealths testifies to the mass of
work of this kind which is being performed gratuitously for the
economist.

There is a second argument against the possibility of economic
experimentation, which is perhaps mlore serious than the one
which has been considered, and it deserves more detailed treatment,
since it has had the support of eminent economists and
logicians. We are told that, even if experiments are tried by
modern governments, they are tried under such conditions as to
have no scientific value and to permit of no convincing conclusions.
This was the view of John Stuart Mill, at once a great
logician and a great economist, and it has been accepted by many,
if not most, of his successors. Mill, after enumerating the four
different methods of experimentation which are possible, concludes
that no one of them is adapted to the social sciences.
Take, for example, the methods of differences and of concomitant


### ---Economics-1912-0-03.txt---
variations. In order tu apply the former, we must have two
iinstances which tally in every particular except the one which is
the subject of inquiry. In order to apply the latter, we must have
a series of phenomena varying together.2
To prove the inapplicability of the method of differences, Mill
takes the example of a protective tariff and shows that it would
be quite impossible to find two nations which are exactly alike in
every respect excepting only in the presence or absence of such a
tariff.3

The method of concomitant variations he thinks equally impossible,
because every attribute of the social body is influenced by
innumerable causes. Hence the changes are the effects, not of a
single cause, but of the combination of many causes.4
We may concede, the difficulty of applying the method of
differences to test the effect of a protective tariff upon the general
wealth of nations, and yet recognize the possibility of experiments
if applied in a different way. It will be noticed that the question
which Mill asks is extremely vague. He inquires whether or not
a protective tariff is "favorable to national riches." That very
question itself requires a further explanation. What do we mean
by "national riches"? Do we take into account the mass of
wealth, or also its distribution, and if we take account of its mass
only, do we mean the total mass or the wealth per capita? In
order to apply the experimental method to economic questions,
we must apply it as it has been applied successfully to the natural
sciences. Now the greatest achievements in science have been
attained, not by putting such general questions as that instanced
by Mill, but by making the questions more and more specific, taking
into accounit only a limited number of phenomena at a time.
Thus while it may well be impossible to trace the effect of a
protective tariff upon the general wealth of the country, it is not
so difficult to trace its effect on the separate factors entering into
that wealth, such as the distribution of wealth between different
classes, the prices of protected commodities, the conservation of
the natural resources of the country, the growth of monopoly, etc.
In claiming for economic phenomena the value which we attach
to experimentation, it should be understood that we are not dealing


### ---Economics-1912-0-04.txt---
with mere observation as applied by the geologist, or the
astronomer, or the zoologist. Most economic experiments, thougl
they may not be made with an avowed scientific purpose, are yet
made on the basis of a definite theory, and the fact that this theory
often enjoys the complete confidence of the legislator does not
alter the fact that it is in its essence experimental, inasmuch as
its results are problematical.
Francis Place, for example, thought that the excesses of trade
unions were due to the restrictions of the law and that, if these
were removed, industrial peace would prevail. His agitation
brought about the repeal of the English combination laws in 1824,
but the great increase in strikes and other disturbances which
promptly followed completely disproved his theorv.
Not only do economic experiments rest as a rule upon some
hypothesis, but they often rest upon the theories of the economists
themselves, which, though they are often derided in the beginning,
slowly filter from the text-books through the magazines and newspapers
into the popular mind and influence public opinion, at
times, long after the economists thenmselves have ceased to believe
them. The economist has at least one attribute of divinity in that
his mills, like those of the gods, grind slowly.
John Stuart Mill advocated taxing the unearned increment in
the value of land as far back as 1848." But when the British
Parliament took the matter up sixty years later, the proposition
impinged upon the Tory mind with the painful shock of a new
idea.

In order to confirm the general view of the relations of the
economist to history which has just been expressed, let us look
specifically at the history of the United States.
The very conditions under which the North American continent
was settled emphasized economic interests above all others.
Such interests are potent in the history of all nations, but, if we
compare our country with Europe since the Middle Ages, we must
recognize that there are two forces very prominent in determining
the history of Europe, which were absent from our country.
One is dynamic ambition, which could not exist in a country
without kings or princes. The other is religious zeal. It is true
that the desire to worship God in their own way led the Pilgrims
first to settle in New England, but it is fair to say that we have


### ---Economics-1912-0-05.txt---
never had in our country those great disturbances which have
been caused by the wars of religion in Europe. Thus in the very
nature of the case economic considerations were predominant.
Another factor entering into European history, though it has
existed in our country, has also played a much less important part.
I refer to racial prejudice. It is true that we have not been free
from this curse, but we have fortunately thus far been spared
wars of races and great racial antagonisms, such as are constantly
arising to pit the Teuton against the Latin or against the Slav
in Europe.

Economic forces have had a wonderfully free play in our country
on account of its newness and, therefore, the absence of institutions
and traditions which resist a change in older communities.
Hence if we look at many of our early laws, such as the Massachusetts
Body of Liberties, we shall see that they deliberately
adopt certain economic ideals which they endeavor to make the
rule of conduct in the commonwealth.
If economic questions were prominent in the settlement of our
country, they have gained in prominence throughout our development.
Most of our political questions have turned upon economic
interests or economic ideals. I need but refer to the
slavery question with all of its many ramifications and complications,
resulting in the Missouri Compromise, the Fugitive Slave
Law, the Compromise of 1850, and the Civil War. I need but
refer to the controversies about the United States Bank, the
endless controversies about the tariff, the currency, the public
lands, and, more recently, regarding immigration, the organization
of labor, and the regulation of railroads and other corporations,
to show what an important part economic questions have
played in our internal development.
Other countries have, it is true, their own economic problems
which they are trying to solve by legislation. But the United
States has the transcendent advantage as an experiment station
of being composed of a group of states each of which legislates
upon a very large range of topics. To a certain extent it shares
this peculiarity with other modern federal states, whose constitutions
are more or less modelled upon ours, such as the Swiss
Republic, the German Empire, Canada, the Australian and South
African commonwealths. But we have the advantage over the
British colonies of a longer historv, and over the European nations


### ---Economics-1912-0-06.txt---
of fewer historical institutions and racial antagonisms, which
interfere with the strictly economic effects, while, as compared
with any one of these states, we have the advantage of a larger
number of units and tlherefore of a broader application of the
method of differences. Economicallv our country may be likened
to a hospital with forty-six general wards, each under separate
medical direction, and a large central ward for certain selected
cases, while a number of outlying pavilions and annexes under still
different systems are loosely connected with the central institution.
What an opportunity this offers the economist who will carefully
study the results of different kinds of treatment.
It is not only in official experimentation through legislation and
administration that our country is rich. It has also been the
happy hunting ground of social Utopias. In many cases it has
been their burying ground as well. Many of these, like the communities
of Mormons, Shakers, the Oneida Community, etc.,
have had a religious or moral ideal. Others, like Brook Farm,
New Harmony, the short-lived Ruskin Colony, the Fairview Colony
of Single Taxers, have been based upon strictly social or economic
ideals. Each of these communities represents on a small
scale a voluntary experiment in some method of combining labor
or of holding land, or of regulating marriage or something of the
kind. The ease with which such Utopias take root in our country
is illustrated by the fact tha-t within two years of the publication
of Looking Backwards more than 500 Bellamy Clubs with a
membership of about 03000 are said to have been established in
California alone.6

The organization of ideal communities which was so popular
in the first part of the nineteenth century seems to be succeeded
in the first part of the twentieth century by an equally enthusiastic
activity in the formation of societies designed to promote some
reform in our public policy. Some of them relate to taxation,
some to the regulation of the liquor traffic, some to labor legislation,
some to conservation, some to land tenure. Each one is a
stimulus urging the legislatures to test by actual experiment the
ideas for which it stands.
Apart from the idealists, we have a great mass of experiments
tried in the self-interest of those who themselves are engaged in


### ---Economics-1912-0-07.txt---
production. Our business men and lawyers have been peculiarly
fertile in evolving new forms of industrial organization. Our
public service corporations are testing new methods of adjusting
their charges, until the study of rates has become almost a science
by itself.7

Likewise the wage receivers are trying all kinds of methods of
improving their own condition. Every strike may be said to
represent an experiment relating directly to the important question
of economic theory: what determines the rate of wages.
In all of this experimenta ion we have the great advantage in
our country of carrying it on under conditions described by that
favorite phrase of the economist, "other things being equal." By
this I do not mean that we have been able to try different things
under absolutely identical conditions such as might be created in
a laboratory, but, as compared with the conditions under which
economic history has developed in other parts of the world, we
may claim for our own country that these experiments have been
conducted under three exceptionally favorable conditions:
(a) They fall within a limited period, so that no great or fundamental
changes have taken place in the cultural standards of
civilization or the mores of the people, such as characterized the
change from the miediaeval to the modern period in Europe.
(b) The experiments have been carried on within an area of
political uniformity, so that, although there are great differences
in latitude and lonigitude, climate and soil, between the different
parts of our country, yet the general legal and social environment
is very nearly the same.
(c) These experiments have been carried on among a people,
which, if not homogeneous in its ethnic makeup, is at least remarkably
uniform in its heterogeneity. Our country is like a good
mince pie; any one slice contains many different ingredients, yet
specimens from different parts of the whole are made up of
nearly the same ingredients, varying mainlv in their relative
prominence. Thus everywhere we have the common basis of the
English language and, with the exception of Louisiana, of English
law. Everywhere, too, we have a greater or less admixture
of different European races, of Africans, and occasionally of
Mongolians. While, of course, the percentage of the different

races varies in different parts of the country, it cannot be said
that any one race except the Anglo-Saxon exerts in any section
a purely racial predominance upon our institutions.8 Even in the
South in communities in which the blacks outnumber the whites
twenty-seven to one, the institutions are essentially Anglo-Saxon
and not Africani. While, therefore, we have not the absolute
control over our conditions that is enjoyed by the chemist, and
while the elements are vastly more complicated than those entering
into the ordinary laboratory experiment, we have conditions relati'
vely favorable for obtaining good results.
The temptation is strong to enumerate at least in part some of
the many fields of economic experimentation which are to be
found in the history of the United States, but to do so would
expand an address into a monograph and is, therefore, out of the
question. Some of these departments of study, such as those
relating to currency, to prices, to the rate of interest, have already
yielded valuable results to the investigator. Some of the more
practical questions, such as those relating to land tenure and the
methods of agriculture, as well as the purely governmental questions
involved in taxation and the management of public debt,
still remain to be studied intensively, in spite of a considerable
amount of work already put upon them. Less, on the whole,
has been done with the problems relating to labor, methods of
remuneration, the rates of wages, the efficiency of labor, etc. We
have tried many experiments in this department of economics.
We have had free labor, indentured labor, and complete slavery.
We have made a sudden transition from slavery to freedom, so
sudden as to bring with it many undesirable results, but perhaps
for that reason the more interesting as an economic experiment.
In the application of free labor we have likewise had experiences
of great value. We have had labor both organized and unorganized,
native born and foreign, and we have had trade unions of
many types and representing many stages of development.
Though considerable attention has been given to this topic, many
of its complicated problems have been barely touched upon. The
economist often inquires about the effect of labor on production,


### ---Economics-1912-0-09.txt---
but he seldom asks "What is the reaction of wealth upon the
efficiency of labor?"
According to the observations made by Mr. Frederick W.
Taylor, it does not pay to increase wages too rapidly. Indeed,
he has endeavored to give a mathematical expression to the possible
rate of economical increase and says that, if wages are
increased up to 60 per cent beyond the wages usually paid, this
increase tends to make the men more thrifty and better in every
way, but that when the rate goes beyond 60 per cent, many of
thenm tend to work irregularly and to become more lazy, shiftless,
extravagant, and dissipated.9
Economists have done little in the study of this phase of the
labor problem since Ricardo laid down the pessimistic view that
the population tends to increase with an increase in wages. Yet
it is a commonplace that, while an efficient population may be
seriously handicapped by the "niggardliness of nature," a country
with large natural resources may be likewise held back, because
the inhabitants either will not or can not utilize them, or because
they do not apply sufficient intelligence and energy in international
competition.

It is a matter of common observation that wealthy families in
our country often contain a number of parasitic members, that is,
members who derive a large income from society without rendering
any appreciable economic or public service in return.
These general and obvious facts need, however, to be examined
historically and statistically, in order to enable us to judge correctly
of the reaction of prosperity on the human mind, and of
the conditions which determine it. Intensive studies of heredity
in families, such as those made by Sir Francis Galton in England
and Dr. Frederick A. Woods and Dr. C. B. Davenport in our
country, are of great value, but need to be supplemented by a
study of the economic reactions. In the case of animal life, the
inherited characteristics are all important, and the skillful breeder
can reasonably expect to find the qualities of the parent in
the offspring. But if cows had the power to deliberately choose
a life of celibacy, we should find many a pedigreed Guernsey,
with ancestors in the advanced register, chewing her cud in idleness
on the hillside and yielding no milk whatsoever, just as we
often find sons of distinguished parents displaying real ability


### ---Economics-1912-0-10.txt---
when put to some academic test, and yet doing nothing to make
their lives either useful or distinguished, for lack of proper
incentive.

These parasitic members of the so-called "leisure class" should
be peculiarly useful specimens for economic study in our country,
because they are not under the social pressure of the feudal
system, inherited in the older countries of Europe from the time
when wealth meant land ownership, and land ownership of necessity
involved public duties. Many of this class in our country
walk our streets, eloquent but unconscious arguments for socialism,
terrible examples for the moralist, living texts for sermons,
rich material for the problem novelist, but still comparatively
neglected by the economist, the sociologist, and the statistician.
We gather the budgets of workingmen, but not of club men; we
collect the statistics of involuntary unemplovment but not of
voluntary idleness; our study of social conditions on the East
Side has not been extended to the West Side. And yet how can
we understand the causes of national decadence, that great and
perennial question of history as well as of practical politics, unless
we unflinchingly examine its phenomena during the growing
period?

Parasitism is, however, but a part of the general subject of
economic pathology, which has been altogether too much
neglected by economists in the past, and which can certainly never
be studied by the deductive method. Or, if we pass bevond the
strictly economic questions to those broader questions of social
policy, what vast materials have we in our country bearing upon
the mixture of races. What a splendid opportunity to test the
tl)eories of the philosophical anarchist, who holds that the ills of
society are due to the law, and who may study in the history of
Alaska the effect of allowing a commonwealth to grow up almost
without law.

It is not possible at this time to enlarge upon these topics.
Some defects in our economic laboratorv should, however, be
pointed out. In the United States experimentation is constantly
interrupted by the power of our courts to nullify laws. Thus
experiments may be overthrown on grounds which are quite
extraneous to their essence. It is as if a biologist were to suddenly
find his laboratory invaded and wrecked by an over-zealous
anti-vivisectionist.


### ---Economics-1912-0-11.txt---
The economist has the further disadvantage that the subjects
of his study and experiment are men like unto himself with
opinions, emotions, and voices. Hence every experiment is accompanied
by a babel of sound, which seems to confuse the whole
subject. The physiologist, working in his quiet laboratory, is
apt to think the very subject-matter of economics ill adapted
to scientific study. If the human body were the seat of a republic
in which all of the microbes that infest it and the ferments that
endanger it were vocal, the investigator would have to put wax in
his ears to keep his mind free from disturbance. Imagine the
bacilli of consumption and typhoid holding periodical elections to
see which should for the next four years control the state of health
of the patient, with a lot of insurgents in the shape of pyaemia and
dyspepsia striving, if not to govern, at least to hold the balance
of power!

Another equally serious defect lies in the inadequacy of our
records. The amount of economic material buried in the archives
of our states is enormous. The material buried in the records of
corporations, of labor unions, of voluntary societies, may be even
greater. The mere index of state economic documents which is
being compiled for the Carnegie Institution of Washington fills a
portly quarto for each one of the older states. The cream of
contemporary evidence bearinig upon the history of Industrial
Society in the United States, recently published by Professor Commons
and his collaborators, fills eleven volumes. But in spite of
this vast material, we still have to contend with the imperfection
of many of our records and with the difliculty of accurate mensuration.
Professor Dewey, in his able presidential address of two years
ago, enlarged upon the inaccuracies of economic observation, and
all serious economists must recognize the truth of what he then
said. But it is the task of the economnist to overcome difficulties,
not to shrink from them, and he can best do this by helping his
successors to obtain a trustworthiness in their material which is
not always available for him. It is encouraging that the federal
authorities, and the state governments as well, are relying more
and more upon trained economists to record economic facts in the
form of statistics and monographic studies. But we should remember
that such studies are not the only agency of a governmental
kind to which we must turn. Every law affecting economic
relations must be treated as an experiment, the recording of whose


### ---Economics-1912-0-12.txt---
results should be provided for in the law itself. How much futile
discussion and how many errors would be avoided if we were able
from year to year to put our hands on the results of the operation
of laws bearing upon economic relations! Just as modern hospitals
not only provide physicians and nurses but also laboratories
and records, so every legislature should have its economic annex,
in which not merely the text of laws but also their results may be
made available both for the legislature and for the student.
The conception of history as an economic laboratory is quite
different from the common conception of economic history. History
is in the main descriptive. It seeks to give us a picture
of the past. If it goes beyond that, it seldom attempts more thail
to trace general causes or to lay down a philosophy of history or
a theory of historical evolution. The economic utilization of
history is almost the antithesis of the economic interpretation of
history, since one is seeking a law of history and the other laws
of economics. The economist undoubtedly owes a debt of gratitude
to historians, and particularly to economic historians, for the
material which they have put at his disposal, and the brilliant
address on "Social Forces in American History," delivered in
1910 by the President of the American Historical Association, is
an indication of the increasing interest which historians are taking
in social and economic elements. The contrast, however, between
their point of view and the economic point of view cannot
be better illustrated than by quoting from this address. Professor
Turner says that he has undertaken his survey for two purposes:
"First, because it has seemed fitting to emphasize the significance
of American development since the passing of the frontier and,
second, because in the observation of present conditions we may
find assistance in our study of the past."' 4 The economist, while
fully appreciating the value and the necessity of studying history
from this point of view, must yet go a step farther and must use
the records of the past as a means of disclosing the operation of
economic forces.

The difference between description and science may be illustrated
by an example taken from the history of physics. The
lamp hanging in the cathedral of Pisa might be described in
every artistic detail by a traveler. The history of the designer


### ---Economics-1912-0-13.txt---
and the story of how it came to be placed there might be told in
full, without adding in the least to our knowledge of physics. It
took the mind of a Galileo, at once analytical and constructive,
to recognize in the apparently meaningless oscillations of the lamp
a constantly acting force, and thus to discover the law of the
pendulum. So the economist must recognize beneath the events
of history the constantly acting economic impulses in the mind
of man.

This view of economic history as a series of experiments is not
in conflict with the evolutionary conception of history. Indeed
it is really necessary to explain it rationally, for, unless we are
willing to accept a blind fatalism, according to which history moves
on without being controlled by human volition, we must recognize
that what seems to us the orderly development of institutions is
rational and orderly, precisely because men have been constantly
trying new expedients and have deliberately retained those institutions
and practices which stand the test of experience. The very
expression "survival of the fittest" implies in human history a
constant testing of new variants, as it does in the animal world,
with this difference, however, that in the animal world the changes
are brought about by the so-called forces of nature, which is
another way of saying that, like Topsy, "they just growed," while
in history most of the changes have been produced by a conscious
effort of the human mind to bring about results. This is none
the less true because few individuals at the time have a sufficiently
broad grasp of what is happening and a sufficiently profound
knowledge of the world to know whither they are tending.
Economic science, after a period of public favor in which its
generalizations enjoyed considerable confidence, seems to have
gone through two rather distinct phases. When it found itself
unable to grapple with many of the problems of the day, it was
derided as the "dismal science" by impatient reformers. More
recently, since it has begun to interest itself more in practical
questions, it seems to be enjoying a popularity, especially in the
United States, which is not without its dangers. It attracts large
classes in our universities; it is being studied in our theological
schools and by our churches; large sums of money are being
spent by our governments in the interest of economic investigations.
The economist must be on his guard against allowing this
present popularity to encourage dilettantism. Our age is growing


### ---Economics-1912-0-14.txt---
more and more critical. The business world is applying rigorous
tests to ascertain results. The educational world is studying
methods of efficiency. The economist will be liable to go through
another period of discredit, unless he realizes that he must apply
to his study the patience, the exactitude, the devotion to truth by
which the great conquests of natural science have been obtained.
He needs all of these qualities in a larger degree even than the
student of nature, because of the long period through which his
observations have to extend, and the great complexity of the
phenomena with which he is dealing. But if he can apply these
qualities in the realization that the world of economic change is
his laboratory, and that it is his task to interpret its lessons, he
will have his reward, in helping to solve the great human problems
which have vexed mankind since the dawn of history.

The question posed by Malthus refuses to be ignored. Again
and again the nations are forced to give ear to it. The celebrated
essay in 1798 marked the boundary between two eras of
thought on this question. Before that a large and increasing
population was generally favored; since that date it has never
ceased to be looked upon by some with doubt and with fear.
The contrast between the two eras, however, is less in respect
to the judgment of results than in respect to the criterion by
which those results are to be measured. Before Malthus the
criterion was the prosperity of the sovereign and of the ruling
classes; thereafter it became the welfare of the increasing masses.
Unwittingly, but none the less truly, Malthus set before the eyes
of men a new picture of the humble unit of population. Instead
of the man with the hoe, patient taxpayer and soldier of the king,
frugal workman contributing with his teeming fellows to swell
the rents of landlords and the profits of employers, Malthus
helped the world to see the human individual, striving to maintain
a family and to win the joys of life, but finding the very number
of his fellows an obstacle in the way toward these ends. Before
Malthus population was a question either of political or of commercial
economy; with him it began to be a question of social
economy.

These statements appear paradoxical when one! recalls that the
first purpose of Malthus was to dispel the illusory hopes of social
perfection. His proposition that population has a fateful tendency
to outstrip the production of food was used to condone the
patent evils of existing society. His doctrine became the stock
argument to discourage plans of social betterment. This may
all be granted. Our purpose is not to praise Malthus but to appreciate
him. In the perspective of more than a century neither
the conscious purposes of men nor the immediate applications of
their teachings are usually seen to have determined their real
influence. Malthus had in some ways a, narrow outlook, and
his often confused thought gave false implications to the main


### ---Economics-1913-0-02.txt---
truth he brought to public attention. Yet he was a man of
gentle spirit, far from harsh and unsympathetic. Approaching
the question solely with the purpose of the student without political
or commercial bias, he became the agent in advancing, if
not in originating, the humanitarian and democratic treatment
of the population problem. That problem is to determine the
best proportion between the number of inhabitants and the area
and resources of a land, judged with reference to the abiding
welfare of the great mass of the people of the nation.
English population doctrine in the 19th century.
When Adam Smith wrote, he could cite many evidences of the
rise of real wages during the course of the eighteenth century.
Twenty-two years later Malthus wrote in a time of war, of nearfamine,
of increasing population, and of decreasing prosperity for
the masses. The forty years that followed were a period of
misery unequalled in modern times for the working classes of
Britain. In this time in England the dominant opinion accepted,
the Malthusian doctrine as the explanation of what was happening,
and derived from it conservative and pessimistic conclusions
as to the popular welfare. Some social corollaries of the doctrine
were however drawn by James Mill and other Radicals and
were restated by J. S. Mill in his Political Economy in 1848. He
showed the benefits to the laborers in the limitation of their numbers,
whereas Malthus had never ceased to regard population as
well-nigh fatalistically determined. By a turn of fate the circumstances
of that very time largely robbed of practical interest
Mill's views on the subject. Things had already taken a turn for
the better. The worst evils of the factory system were in course
of being remedied, the sanitation of cities was improving, the
laborers were better organized, the rate of growth of population
was slackening, and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 had
prepared the way for the cheapening of the food of the people
even in a period of rising wages following the gold discoveries.
Cooperating with these influences, the improvement of transportation
was opening up new sources of food supplies on virgin soils
and making them available to the markets of western Europe. In
the following half century the real wages and general welfare of
the masses, alike in western Europe and in the United States,
were to advance almost steadily. This whole movement was well
under way when Mill was writing. In such a period as that, the


### ---Economics-1913-0-03.txt---
Malthusian doctrine in any version could not but appear to the
practical eye to be either false or futile. It lost its usefulness
as a conservative argument in support of existing institutions, for
the best argument was the unmistakable progress of the masses.
It lost its hostile character to the champions of radical change.
American views on population.
American views on population were from the first unfriendly
to the Malthusian doctrine. It appeared in the earlier textbooks
of English origin or written under English influence, and as a
mere classroom abstraction it was given a small measure of
curious attention. But in any of its forms it involved an opinion
adverse to an unrestrained increase of population, whereas the
conditions in America made such an idea appear false as theory
and harmful in practice. A growing population was favorable to
the interests alike of landowners, of active business men, of the
rival sections, and of the national government. There resulted
from this economic situation a peculiarly American optimism on
the subject. Density of population as an influence favorable to
the division of labor and to the economies of production in manufacture
was looked upon as in itself an efficient cause in increasing
the per capita income. One type of this optimism, exemplified by
Henry George, denied on principle that population ever could
increase too much. Another type, represented by Henry Carey,
held that population in fact was not likelv to increase too much in
America. The national bias often led to crediting to American
character all of the benefits resulting from exceptional natural resources
combined with relative scarcity of population. This bias
and this reasoning still survive among us today.
Rapid settlement of the United States.
Students of American economic conditions are familiar with the
series of shaded charts in the Census volumes on population showing
by decades the extension of the settled area since 1790 and its
gradually increasing density. As one studies the earlier of these
charts one can see how the blank spaces on the maps of that day
must have aroused the imagination and the hopes of men. There
lay whole empires of land almost untenanted and calling to be used.
Decade by decade for a hundred years the frontier extended at a
hardly slackening rate while the density increased on the settled
area, until abruptly, about 1890, the process ended or changed


### ---Economics-1913-0-04.txt---
its nature. The chart for 1900 shows little alteration in its outline
from that for a decade earlier. The increase of population in
the decade had been thirteen millions, but of these, eight millions
had been added to the urban and only five millions to the rural
population. In the following decade, from 1900 to 1910, the
increase was sixteen millions, of which twelve millions were added
to the urban and but four millions to the rural population. Dividing
our national history since 1790 into four periods, each of
thirty years, it is seen that in the first the density per mile
increased .7 of an inhabitant, in the second 2.4 inhabitants, in the
third 9, and in the fourth 14. Thus the increase in the number
per square mile has gone on at an accelerating rate, and was
twenty times as fast in the last as in the first period. As an index
of the demands which increasing population makes upon resources,
these figures are more truly significant than are the absolute numbers
of people or the percentage of increase by decades; for they
show how many additional inhabitants must find employment,
materials, and food on the available area. This means greater
intensiveness of utilization. The cumulative additions are now
made on an area nearing, or already past, the point of maximum
advantage to the masses of the nation.
Disappearance of the frontier.
By 1890 the habitable agricultural area of the United States
had not been completely occupied, but the frontier of fertile lands
ready for man's use had at length been all but attained. Suddenly
was unmasked the true character of those great, uncolored areas
shown on the map. Deserts they are, for the most part, deserts
they must ever remain. Nature had no more free gifts to distribute
to the prodigal children of America. She would grant still
some new arable fields, but only for the price of toil and patient
art. Our increasing population must thenceforth find its livelihood
in the more intensive cultivation of the settled areas. We
had been rapidly losing those economic advantages which had
distinguished us from the older, more densely settled countries. A
new ecomonic situation confronted our people.
Economic results did not long delay their appearance. In the
nineties of the last century the wave of popular prosperity at
length attained its crest. Some great forces lifting wages throughout
Christendom despite any counteracting effects from increasing
population seem at last to have spent themselves. Cheap food


### ---Economics-1913-0-05.txt---
from America had been a boon to the European workman as well
as to the American. The year 1896 marked the lowest American
prices in recent decades for food and for farm products. The year
1898 was that of maximum export of foodstuffs from the United
States. Since 1896 food and other farm products have almost
steadily advanced in price at a more rapid rate than general
prices; since 1898 exports of foodstuffs from the United States
have less steadily, but none the less surely, declined. In the past
twenty years the general progress in science and the technical arts
has been phenomenal. It is the accepted economic belief that the
trend and effect of such changes is favorable to the real wages of
labor. The last twenty years, therefore, should have been a period
of rapidly rising wages had not this technical progress been offset
by some powerful opposing forces. Why have real wages risen so
slowly or even fallen? In part no doubt the explanation may be
found in the fact that when the general scale of prices is rising
wages move more tardily. In large part the explanation must
be found in the fact that we have passed the point of diminishing
returns in the relation of our population to our resources. The
growth of population is serving to neutralize for the masses of
the people the gains of technical progress. It is high time to revise
the optimistic American doctrine of population.
Extravagant esti'mates of future population.
The public is accustomed to the estimates of enormous population
possible on the present area of this country. These estimates
express to many, perhaps to most Americans, not only the possible
but also the inevitable and desirable increase. They ask: why
should not an area almost equal to that of Europe support 400,-
000,000 instead of one fourth that number? We have little more
than thirty inhabitants per square mile. France and AustriaHungary
have each a population over six times as dense, Switzerland
eight times, Germany and Italy ten times, the Netherlands
fifteen times, and Belgium twenty-two times. We have but to equal
Italy to support a population of a billion. We have but to equal
Belgium to support two and a quarter billions. But if we could
conceivably support such a future population on the present area
it would be in what manner, with what gain to civilization and at
what cost to the popular welfare?
Take the German Empire as a standard of comparison. Despite
the great material advances in Germany of late, the real wages of


### ---Economics-1913-0-06.txt---
the working people are much below those in America. Who would
suggest that with the conditions of popular thought in America
we could calmly contemplate the decline of wages and of the standard
of living among us toward those of the German masses today?
The Swiss in their mountainous land with a population four
fifths as dense as that of Germany are achieving quite as wonderful
a result. Only a marvel of patient industry enables the Swiss to
draw their livelihood from such an area. Watch the Swiss peasant
at his work and you may understand. The cattle stand in the
stable while the peasant cuts their food and brings it to them lest
they may trample down the precious grass. Man's labor is less
valuable there than are the uses of that little patch of land. In
the haying season the harvester clings with one hand to the steep
mountain side, cutting the grass by the handful and piling it in
little bunches loaded down with stones to keep it from blowing
away, until it can be carried down into the valley on the backs
of men and women. That is what such a density of population
means, translated into terms of human labor.
Shall Italy be our population-ideal? A recent well-known traveler'
from America reports the ordinary food of the laborer in
Sicily as consisting of "a piece of black bread and perhaps a bit
of soup of green herbs of some kind or other." "For days or
months the peasants live on almost any sort of green thing they
find in the fields, frequently eating it raw just like the cattle."
Consequences of further rapid increase.
In the light of such facts, the flights of speculative statistics
regarding the possible increase of our population evidence a forgetfulness
of economic principles and a recklessness of economic
consequences. To force production very fast or far on a given
area entails some notable results. Cultivation must become in
part more intensive, with hand labor, in part more expensive, with
a larger investment in equipment on larger farms.
We have heard much of late the appeal, Back to the land! As
a plan to be followed by masses of men with the hope of relieving
the pressure of population it is vain. Every time one pair of
hands is added to the agricultural population, three more mouths
are added to the city population waiting to consume the products.
America has no exclusive knowledge of mechanical inventions
and no exclusive claim to their use. They are internationally

patented and for sale. Whoever finds it profitable may use them.
If they are used less in other countries it is because the work can
be done miore cheaply by hand under their conditions. The general
level of the use of machinery is largely fixed by the relations
between population and resources, and not by any mysterious
racial talent for machinery. It is the density of population that
mainly explains the contrast in this regard between the people of
Europe on the one hand, and on the other those of the same races
in America, Canada, and Australia.
Popular welfare in America is already threatened. To preserve
the favorable relation of population to resources and to control
in some measure the fate and fortunes of the children of this and
future generations the two most important means possible are:
conservation of national resources, and retarding the rate of increase
of population.

>Seed of a conservation policy.
For the conserv ation movement, that sadly belated attempt to
check national prodigality, let us speak only words of approval.
But we must recognize its limitations. As to minerals, it only
cdelays their inevitable, final exhaustion. At the present rate of
increase of the use of our stores, iron ore will be exhausted in
thirty years, petroleum in ninety years, and coal in one hundred
fiftv years. If, however, the population became stationary, the
periods of possible use would be enormously extended. In the
reclamattion of soil by drainage and irrigation the outlook is that
about 15 per cent may thus be added ultimately to the area in
farms, representing at the most 40 per cent addition to the present
food production by present methods. Even when all this has
been accomplished at much cost it provides barely for two decades
of increase of our population at the present rate, and by 1930 the
natioiial demand for food will again be in the same relation to the
productive area that it now is.
The hope is ever with us that improvements in agricultural
methods will offset the influence of the increase of population. We
rightly speak of the wonders of the new agriculture; but these
improvements fast crowding upon each other in the past two
decades have not even kept the cost of food from increasing in
terms of the common man's wage. Shall we then base an economic
policy on the assumption of much greater improvements which as
yet are only in the realm of imagination? Undoubtedly the development


### ---Economics-1913-0-08.txt---
of water power will retard the trend toward higher
prices of coal; forestry will eventually grow lumber enough to
meet the greatly curtailed demand at higher prices; but, given a
population steadily increasing at anything like the present rate,
and real wages in America must decrease in terms of food, clothing
and fuel, and all the commodities dependent on wood, iron,
copper, and other primary materials. The steady increase alone
of population will offset the popular benefits of the new miracles
of industrial progress.
Declining rate of natural increase.
The percentual rate of increase of population in the United
States has shown a general downward trend since the Civil War.
Before 1860 it had been steadily near 35 per cent each decade;
between 1860 and 1890 it ranged between 30 and 23 per cent;
and in each of the last two decades it has been about 21 per cent.
This downard trend has been tardily following a declining birth
rate. Race suicide, however, is very far from being an imminent
peril for the nation as a whole. The real occasion for disquietude
is that this phenomenon is so largely correlated with education and
with eminent attainment. In many families the birth rate is much
too high for the welfare of the parents, of the children, and of
the community. Recent studies among city populations have
demonstrated that as the number of births in a family passes a
mnoderate limit the mortality increases inordinately.
Our population increased between 1900 and 1910 nearly sixteen.
million people. A much slower rate of growth would realize the
common prediction of a quarter billion in another century, and a
half billion in two centuries. So far as these figures are based on
forecasts of "natural increase" (exclusive of immigration), they
may prove to be largely overestimated. Changes in public opinion,
in social standards, in the means of communication and of education,
in industry, and in family relations, are in rapid progress.
Affecting wider and wider circles, these influences promise to
strengthen greatly the forces making for volitional control of population.
The earlier applications of the doctrine of eugenics
probably will be to control the increase of imental and of physical
defectives. These forces, if not neutralized, will rapidly reduce thne
rate of increase.


### ---Economics-1913-0-09.txt---
The qwestion of immigration.
In the decade ending 1910, but for immigration, the rate of
increase of the total population would have been much less instead
of somewhat greater than that of the preceding decade. But in
1910 there were over three million more foreign-born persons in
the country than were here ten years earlier. One fifth of the
increase in population consisted in foreign-born, and another fifth
of their children born in America. In each of the six years preceding
the census nearly a million immigrants arrived. All previous
records were exceeded. The continuing possibilities of immigration
as a source of contributions to our population in thle fuiture
are enormous.2 As migration is made easier by the spread of information
and by the improvement of the means of travel, the lure
of a higher wage becomes more and more effective. There is no
limit to this motive, except the meager cost of steerage passage,
until real wages in America are leveled down to those of the most
impoverished populations permitted to enter our ports.
The current objections to immigration are mainly based on the
alleged evil effects to the political, social, and moral standards of
the community. It is often asserted that present immigration
is inferior in racial quality to that of the past. Whatever be the
truth and error mingled in these views, we are not now discussing
them. Our view is wholly impersonal and without race prejudice.
If the present immigration were all of the Anglo-Saxon race, were
able to speak, read and write English, and had the same political
sentiments and capacities as the earlier population, the validity
of our present conclusions would be unaffected.
The open-door policy, then and now.
When our policy of unrestricted immigration is thus opposed
to the interests of the mass of the people, its continuation in a
democracy where universal manhood suffrage prevails, is possible
only because of a remarkable complexity of ideas, sentiments.

of all lands is a part of our national heritage. The wish to share
with others the blessings of freedom and of economic plenty is the
product of many generations of American experience. The open
door policy had partly a political basis: a growing population in a
young and sparsely settled country gave greater security on the
frontier of settlement and greater strength against foreign enemies.
The policy had, however, mainly an economic basis: land
was here a free good on the margin of a vast frontier. Most
citizens benefited by a growing population. Let it not be accounted
cynicism to recognize in this national self-interest the source of a
generous sentiment toward the incoming stranger. That sentiment,
truly generous, now lingers after its real cause has disappeared.
It impels to an unthinking liberality to the alien while
sacrificing the heritage of the workers of America; it makes the
citizen with humane ideals the misguided ally of commercial greed.
The open door policy is vain to relieve the condition of the masses
of other lands. Emigration from overcrowded countries, with
the rarest exceptions, leaves no permanent gaps. Natural increase
quickly fills the ranks of an impoverished peasantry. If America
with futile hospitality continues to welcome great numbers from
countries with low standards of living, she can but reduce the level
of her own prosperity while affording no permanent relief to the
overcrowded lands. Nations under bad governments must find
relief through the reform of their own political conditions. Lands
whose people are in economic misery must improve their own industrial
organization, elevate their standards of living, and limit
their numbers. If they go on breeding multitudes which find an
unhindered outlet in continuous migration to more fortunate
lands, they can at last but drag others down to their own unhappy
economic level.

The pride of immigrants and of their children, sometimes to the
second and third generations, is another strong force opposing
restriction. Immigrants, having become citizens, are proud of the
race of their origin, and resent restriction as a reflection upon
themselves and their people. One may admire the loyalty and
idealism here manifested, while regretting that these sentiments and
arguments serve to distract attention from the real problem to
minor and irrelevant incidents.
Public welfare or private profits.
A strong commercial motive operates in the most influential
class of employers in favor of the continuance of immigration.


### ---Economics-1913-0-11.txt---
From the beginning of our history, proprietors and employers
have looked with friendly eyes upon the supplies of comparatively
cheap labor coming from abroad. This has been a potent factor
in many of our political and economic policies. The early comers
to America strove in every way to obtain a cheap labor force
through immigration. Large numbers of immigrants or of their
children have been able soon, in the conditions of the times, to
become proprietors and employers. Thus was hastened the peopling
of the wilderness. The interest of these classes harmonized
to a certain point with the public interest; but likewise it was in
some respects in conflict with the abiding welfare of the whole
nation. It encouraged much defective immigration from Europe
and led to the fateful introduction of slavery from Africa. A
small planter class, heedless of the future, provided for its own
ease, but it left to posterity a dark and bloody heritage which
still remains the greatest threat to the American democratic experiment.


The immigration from Europe has furnished an ever changing
group of workers moderating the rate of wages which employers
otherwise would have had to pay. The continual influx of cheap
labor has aided in imparting values to all industrial opportunities.
A large part of these gains have been in the trade, manufactures,
and real estate of cities as these have taken and retained an ever
growing share of the immigrants. Successive waves of immigration,
composed of different races, have been ready to fill the ranks
of the unskilled workers at meager wages. This continuous inflow
has in many industries come to be looked upon as an indispensable
part of the labor supply. Conditions of trade, methods of manufacturing,
prices, profits, and the capital value of the enterprises
have become adjusted to the fact. Hence results one of those
illusions cherished by the practical world when it identifies its own
profits with the public welfare. Without immigration, it is said,
the supply of labor would not be equal to the demand. It would
not at the present wages. Supply and demand have reference to a
certain price. At a higher wage the amount of labor offered and
the amount demanded will come to an equality. This would temporarily
curtail profits, and other prices would, after readjustment,
be in a different ratio to wages. Such a prospect is most
displeasing to the commercial world, quick to see disaster in a disturbance
of profits, slow to see popular prosperity in rising wages.


### ---Economics-1913-0-12.txt---
Abnormal labor conditions.
The labor supply coming from countries of denser population
and with low standards of living creates, in some occupations, an
abnormally low level of wages and prices. Children can not be
born in American homes and raised on the American standard of
living cheaply enough to maintain at such low wages a continuous
supply of laborers. Many industries and branches of industry in
America are thus parasitical. A condition essentially pathological
has come to be looked upon as normal. It is the commercial
ideal which imposes itself upon the minds of men in other circles.
The new immigration has recently been described by an author
who combines wide knowledge of the facts with keen sympathy for
the immigrant. He says :2 "The past industrial development of
America points unerringly to Europe as the source whence our
unskilled labor supply is to be drawn. ... America is in the
race for the markets of the world; its call for workers will not
cease." Yet a few pages further he must say: "All wage earners
in America agree that it is not as easy to make a living today as
it was twenty years ago, and the dollar does not go as far now as
it did then. The conflict for subsistence on the part of the wage
earner is growing more stern as we increase in numbers and industrial
life becomes more complicated, and the fact must be faced
that the vast army of workers must live more economically if
peace and well being are to prevail." Here is our argument: increase
in numbers is making the conflict for subsistence more stern.
But how different the conclusion!
The opposition to restriction.
What tremendous forces are combined in favor of a policy of
unrestricted immigration: sentiment and business, generosity, selfishness,
laborers, employers. All men are prone to view immigration
in its details, not in its entirety. They see this or that individual
or class advantage, not the larger national welfare. The
interests of capitalists and of the newly arriving immigrants are
abundantly considered; the interests of the mass of the people now
here are overlooked.
The depressing effect of the ever present and ever renewing
supply of immigrant labor upon wages, appears most clearly at
the time of wage contests, and often seems to be the most important


### ---Economics-1913-0-13.txt---
aspect of the question. The law against contract labor does
not check the great stream of those guided by friends to a "job."
If immigration were suddenly stopped in a period of normal or of
increasing business, wages in many occupations would at once
rise, and that, without the aid of strikes or arbitration. This
would affect most those occupations which now present the most
serious social problems, in mines, factories, and city sweat shops.
In some small measure the war in the Balkan States, by recalling
many men for service, has had this influence. Organized labor
thinks most of these immediate effects. Commonly labor's protest
is expressed in terms of the untenable "lump of labor" theory of
wages. "Every foreign workman who comes to America" is believed
to take "the place of some American workman." The error
in this too rigid conception of the influence of new supplies of
labor need not be argued before an audience of economists. But in
the light of the doctrine of population there is no mistaking the
influence of continually increasing numbers in gradually and permanently
depressing the whole plane of wages. It is generally
assumed that when the immigrants and their children become
Americanized and raise their standard of living their presence no
longer has any effect in depressing wages below what they otherwise
would have been. Indeed it is tacitly assumed that the law of
increasing returns operates as population becomes denser, and
that the general prosperity is enhanced by the mere growth of
numbers. This idea was measurably true so long as national
growth was one of extension into unoccupied areas, and the
average density of population was low. It ceases to be true
whenever the ideal point of equilibrium between population and
resources has been attained. The territorial distribution of immigrants,
their training in the English language, and their adoption
of American standards of living, can not change a mathematical
fact.

Conditions of progress.
John Stuart Mill, in discussing the future of society when population
might be expected to have ceased increttsing, employed an
already current term, the "stationary state." The phrase is
hardly felicitous for, as he explained, this does not mean a society
stationary in the industrial arts and in mental, moral, and social
culture. Indeed it was just such a condition of a stationary
population that he deemed the ultimate ideal when once that degree


### ---Economics-1913-0-14.txt---
of density had been attained which made possible the highest
level of the general welfare. The theory of evolution as applied to
social progress has suggested that a certain pressure of conflicting
and thwarted desires is required to keep a people industrious,
inventive, and progressive. The crude version of the theory implies
the necessity of competition on the plane of physical want
resulting from the pressure of population. A subtler conception
would place this competition on the higher plane of developing
desires made possible by industrial advance, political democracy,
popular education, and a widening horizon of thought. A large
part of our people have attained that stage now, and the cultural
circle is ever widening. The spur of progress consists of the felt
limitations of incomes, relative to expanding desires, rather than
in the pangs of hunger. Once the spur of progress was objective,
now it is subjective.
Popular aspirations and ideals.
In the last century popular education and ideals were rising at
the same time that a rising scale of wages was made possible by
industrial improvements accompanying the development of great
material resources. Yet this fortunate union of events did not suffice
to prevent the growth of discontent. Popular aspirations outstripped
material progress. Much more ominous is the situation
now that the pressure of population in America is beginning to
check and reverse this trend of the popular welfare. Those who
profit for a time by these shifts in the forces of distribution may
find, like those who benefited by slavery, that they have bartered
the peace and security of their children for the pleasures of a
brief season.

The common man in our democracy has at stake the preservation
of the advantages of our broad territory and bountiful resources.
The only factor in the present increase of population
that is controllable in large measure by legislative action is immigration.
Many representatives of organized labor, though moved
by more immediate considerations than those here presented, favor
limitation. But- the mass of the workers, diverted by false councils,
traditional sentiments, and racial sympathies, are divided on
the question. Without help from other groups of citizens the
laborers of America can not obtain the needed legislation.
Whether that help will be progressively granted in the years to
comne depends on the clearness of our economic judgments and on


### ---Economics-1913-0-15.txt---
the strength of our patriotic ideals. Perhaps those ideals are not
clear to us. Would we have the level of the popular welfare in
America fall even by a little if this could be prevented? Would
we rival other lands rather in population than in prosperity?
Would we wish to gain in density of settlement while losing in that
largeness of opportunity and of outlook which makes possible the
traits most distinctive of American life? Already we have on our
map many cities swarming like ant hills, the delight of the real
estate speculator and the despair of true friends of humanity.
Shall it be our ideal to multiply men on city streets and in smoking
suburbs, away from fields, and forests, and mountains; or shall we
not rather give to all our people space to earn an ample living and
to live an ample life, worthy of our democratic ideal?

For some twenty-five years there has been a marked recession
among English-speaking peoples from the strong individualism of
the early 19th century towards a gradual extension of government
authority in economic imatters. Laissez-faire has been discredited
both as a principle of political philosophy and as a rule of conduct.
Whether we should try to restore its prestige or with what
other principle we shall replace it, however, are matters concerning
which current discussion is somewhat confused. On the one
hand are those who declare that competition has broken down, and
has produced a monopolistic system which will in time completely
cupplant it, and which is of such tremendous extent and power
that it can be managed only by the government. On the other
hand are those who believe that competition is a force which should
be preserved as a ruling power in economic life, and would therefore
prevent by government action the establislhment of monopolies
and break them up where they are already established. This, in
substance, is the policy that our own federal government has been
pursuing since the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Law in
1887. Still others urge that all we need to do is to prevent the
evils of excessive competition by setting limits within which competitive
forces must work. The first group of thinkers take the
socialistic view and call for government ownership or at least for
direct government management. The second group are still in
effect believers in the laissez-faire principle, and think to restore
it by destroying monopoly. The third group also are still faithful
to their belief in the efficacy of competition but would restrict
its field of operation at the bottom so as to prevent industrial
degradation.

A centralizing tendency, that is, a departure from the principle
of individual liberty and a return to the principle of authority, is
to be seen in many if not all domains of thought at the present
time. Therefore, to understand properly what is going on in
industrial life we need to look at the change that is going on in
other life spheres. The terms laissez-faire and competition are


### ---Economics-1914-0-02.txt---
commonly used to describe the policy more properly called economic
liberalism. But economic liberalism is more than a political
platform or an economic formula. It is a system of culture that
has given character to the life of a great people for more than
two centuries. It is a superstructure erected on the principle of
personal liberty in religious and political matters. The 17th
century was an era of religious contest that resulted in the
establishment of ecclesiastical independence, which in turn carried
the rule of individualism to constitutional and political emancipation.
Once established in religion and politics, the principle of
personal independence found its way into economic conduct, and
the system was thereby made complete. Just as in its upbuilding
it was closely connected with personal liberty in other spheres of
life, so the present alleged breakdown of competition-the principle
of personal liberty in economic life-and the alleged restoration
of the principle of authority finds its counterpart in the movement
towards church unity, uniformity of creed, the extension of
state as against local authority over education, the extension of the
federal principle in politics, and the widening censorship of morals.
The application of the authoritarian principle is being made in
these lines for reasons quite similar to those that are causing its
application in industrial affairs. The excesses of the personal
liberty system in morals, religion and literature, have produced
results that are shocking the sensibilities and shattering the ideals
of multitudes of people. Hence, the demand for control. In politics
the extreme application of the principle of local government
has rendered equity, justice, and efficiency impossible in a multitude
of ways. Hlence, the demand for state and federal control.
Under no system of government regulation of conduct, however
extensive or intensive, has competition or personal initiative
been entirely absent, unless, indeed, under a system of slavery;
and at no time, under the most extended system of competitive
action, has it been possible to do away entirely with government
supervision and regulation. Even among the English-speaking
peoples in the past two centuries, when the laissez-faire aspects of
economic liberalism have seemed to predominate, it has not been
possible to get on without government regulation and supervision.
The reason is that the knowledge and resources underlying any
political and social system are constantly changing. Whether
the principle of personal liberty, expressed through competition,
or the principle of authority, expressed through government regula


### ---Economics-1914-0-03.txt---
tion, shall be the dominating principle of civilization at a
particullar period, depends on which one of them is likely, under
existing conditions of knowledge and resources, most largely to
promiote welfare. When evils flow from the too extensive application
of the prevailing principle, or, when, in new circumstances,
it is less productive of welfare, emphasis is gradually shifted until
the otlher principle occupies the foreground and becomes the dominating
force. Such is the situation now. Conditions have changed
so that the necessity and value of regulation are emphasized again.
The reSgime of personal freedom of competition un-der the conditions
of rapid scientific discovery and material growth has failed
to preserve, or perhaps to produce, the equality necessary for
success among competitors. Growing population, the development
of vast resources, the great size of units of industry, have
made the applicatioa of the competitive principle in many ways
impracticable. Competition has degenerated at many points fronm
a struggle between equals to an exploitation of the weak by the
strong. Industry has been swallowed up by industry until in
many lines a practical monopoly exists, so that prices, wages,
terms of employment, and the welfare of large numbers of people,
are in the control of comparativelv few. The benefits of the common
heritage of natural resources hbae passed too largely from
the people at large. On all sides we find private monopolies and
a natural system of capitalistic industry, inIvolvin g large control
of the opportunity for livelihood for the many. These evils bave
been produced, under conditions favorable to the acquisition of
great wealth and its massing under the corporate principle, by
a svsTtem that gave the world a "democratic constitution," "the
sa me law for all," "toleration," "capitalistic competition," "individual
initiative," and the otber benefits of liberalism. In more
general terms, the causes for the extension of government control
are: the ill-doing of some under the competitive system; our desire
for rapid national development, which led us to give large powers
to those who were to assume the risks of frontier promotionpowers
which, then innocuous, have niow become dangerous-; a
demand for a better standard of living by the great body of the
working class, who are asking with some show of reason what the
advances in science and industry have done for them. Moreover,
there is a feeling of resentmenit of control by others of their
opportunity to make a living.
The demand for state regulati-on either for the purpose of


### ---Economics-1914-0-04.txt---
restoring the competitive principle in industry, or frankly supplanting
it with the principle of authority, finds somie justification,
too, in the belief, not altogether ill founded, that the
economic evils of great industry have arisen in part from the
treatment of the modern form of the corporation by our courts
of law. They have given it in a measure the attributes of a
natural person, without imposing upon it the consequences of personal
responsibility. Hence, it has frequently been impossible
to reach the misdeeds of individuals because of their attribution
to non-personal agents. Penal remedies and preventive measures
alike have been often ineffective to protect the public. Consciousness
of this evil is seen in the demand for holding directors
of corporations to personal responsibility for the acts of the
corporation, and in the movement for the disruption of "corporations
of corporations."

From all these causes arises the demand for government protection
for the weak in industry; and some people appear to think
that unless the right to make a living is in a reasonable measure
provided, the next step may be an attack on the institution of
private property itself. In consequence, "today a great economic
movement is going on whbih aims at reorganizing the entire industrial
system from the social standpoint." The call is for the
state to look after the conditions of living and work of workers,
the management of prices and output of large enterprises, or to
take them over and thereby free the many from a virtual economic
control of the few, and reestablish, supposedly for all, a
proper standard of welfare.
An explanation of the establishment of economic liberalism as
a system, in the extreme form in which it has existed for more
than a century, is found in the abnormal condition of the four
centuries succeeding the discovery of America. Since that discovery
the life of the world has been abnormal in the sense that
it has been in a state of unstable equilibrium because of the existence
of opportunities for personal initiative, personal gain, and
individual expansion under conditions that yielded larger rewards
than ever before. Economic pressure in the old world could be
relieved by overflow into the new world. The great advantage
that came from this situation is now reduced by the substantial
occupation of this continent. The fact that our continent is, in
the present stage of the arts, substantially occupied, indicates
that the world is about to return to a more stable economic


### ---Economics-1914-0-05.txt---
equilibrium. The development of the industrial evils of today
and the consequent demand for regulation are simply an unconscious
acknowledgment that, all things considered, we have
reached in this country a stage of relatively diminishing returns
in our economic activity. It is a recognition of the truth of the
law of diminishing returns and of the Malthusian doctrine of
population, that unless the arts progress more rapidly than
population there is bound in time to be a relative pressure of
population on subsistence.
Man is so constituted that when he feels the evils of an existing
system he is likely to adopt measures of reform which will
produce evils as great as those he is seeking to remedy. That
danger exists now. We need to look very closely at the tendency
towards the extension of the authority of government into the
details of our economic life. The principle of competition, the
system of economic liberalism, has been too helpful to the progress
of mankind to be given up altogether. It has become an enduring
part of our civilization and philosophy of life. We cannot
deny that the competitive system has promoted liberty and
welfare, initiative and perseverance, industry and success, wealth
and culture, an abundance that has relieved poverty, has exploited
to human benefit the resources of nature more abundantly
than ever before, has enlarged knowledge, has provided for the
possibility of a greatly increased population, and, generally, has
uplifted the life of the people. No system which will deprive mankind
of these advantages is likely to promote welfare unless it
supplies other motives to the same results. For competition has
been a developing force, even if it has failed somewhat as a controlling
one. The motive power to action is of more iniportance
in the long run than the regulation of action.
In order to judge clearly the reasonableness of this demand for
wider government control of economic life, and possible results
of acquiescence in it, we must recall for a moment the ultimate purpose
of government. It is, undoubtedly, the promotion of the
welfare of the people who organize it. In the words of Justice
Gray, "The prosecution of the safety, health, the morals, good
order and the general welfare is the chief end of government,"
and the general welfare includes protection of opportunity to
make a living. This is not a new maxim in the jurisprudence
of the English-speaking peoples. The system of personal liberty
and the system of government control, or any combination of


### ---Economics-1914-0-06.txt---
them, has always had, and must always have, as its ultimate aim,
among these peoples, the establishment of welfare. All social institutions,
including the system of private property, are encouraged,
or permitted, for this end. As Justice Bruce of the
Supreme Court of North Dakota has put the matter: "It can
now be safely said that the courts and the public generally have
come to see and to hold that a right to property and liberty
should never be guaranteed in matters and things which are inj
urious to the public health, the public welfare, or the public
rnorality, or even to the convenience of the public as a whole."
As we have seen, the call for the application of the power of
government assumes several forms. Some call upon it to restore
the competitive principle by breaking up large industries, and so
to regulate business that competition will operate within certain
assigned limits. This is the neomercantilism that is sweeping
over the world. Some call upon it to assume that competition as
a regulative force is dead, and therefore to permit monopoly
under supervision. Others insist that since competition is dead
and monopoly established the government itself shall take over
and manage the greatest of these monopolies. This is the demand
of the socialists.

It is not worth our while to consider the last proposal. There
is no evidence worth considering that the American people have
yet reached the point where they desire the establishment of the
socialistic state. The principles of individual liberty and the
rights that have been established uipon them through the long
struggle of four centuries will not be abandoned. Economic
liberalism in the large sense is and will remain a living faith
among the English-speaking peoples, even though they may see
fit to establish what is called the new "social state."
It is impossible, of course, to discuss now all the projects put
up, either for the complete restoration of competition, or for its
partial restoration under government regulation. I invite your
attention, therefore, to a few of the proposed lines of action.
It is urged, first, that the government promote welfare by general
social legislation; second, that the government regulate wages,
particularly by establishing a general minimum wage; third, that
the government regulate prices, particularly in those articles
that may be regarded as the products of monopolistic, or partly
monopolistic, industries; fourth, that the government determine
in some way the form and size of business organizations; fifth,


### ---Economics-1914-0-07.txt---
that the action of government be confined to supervision of business
as it is carried on in order to prevent infractions of the law
and give full publicity to the methods of so-called "big business"
; and finally, that the right of society in great accumulations
of property shall be mnore clearly defined and enforced either
by taxation or other means.
The proposal for what is called welfare legislation, for such
purposes as the prevention of accidents, sanitary conditions of
work, due limitation of hours of work, the protection of women
and children in industry, and all similar legislation, has long
passed out of the stage of debate. Formerly governments busied
themselves in enacting labor laws against labor. Now they busy
themselves in the enactmenit of laws interfering with labor in the
interest of labor. The principle of this legislation is accepted,
however men may differ about details.
When we come to the proposition to fix a minimum wage, we
are confronted with more debatable questions. In so far as the
wages actually paid in so-called sweated and parasitic industries
are below what the employer could afford to pay while still
making a proper profit-in so far, in other words, as they are
due to exploitation-; in so far as wages paid are insufficient to
afford a decent living in any industry in which profits are large
from some monopolistic advantage ;-in short, in all cases in
which wages are below what is necessary for a decent living in
any employment because of "exploitation"-there can be but
one opinion of the desirability of insisting upon a minimum. It
would be a mistake, however, either to insist upon a minimum
wage in all industries, or to compel the payment of a minimum
wage which, as a matter of fact, is more than the value produced
by the person receiving it if the returns to entrepreneur and
capitalist are but fair, or to insist upon a minimum wage in any
case without providing for its constant readjustment. To justify
these statements we must consider some of the effects of such an
action. In the discussion I repeat that I am leaving out all cases
of mere exploitation, assuming that in these a compulsory standard
is economically justifiable.
If a minimum wage is established larger in amount than the
product of the marginal workers, they are bound to be thrown
out of work. It is easy to say that if an industry is not able
to pay a "living wage" it had better not exist. But a "living
wage" is a very variable thing, and the fact that some people are


### ---Economics-1914-0-08.txt---
living on the wage they get may be regarded as evidence that
to them it is a living wage, although not a desirable living wage.
The question to be considered is not whether such an industry is
worth while, but whether, if we by election abolish it, those who
are thrown out of work can find other employment at as good
or better wages. It is difficult to see where they would find it if,
ins economic terminology, they are "the marginal workers," and
are already getting what they produce.
The imposition of a minimum wage under such circumstances
would make it necessary for employers in many cases to raise the
margin of industry and discharge their present marginal workers.
Otherwise the business would not be profitable. This is only another
way of saying what has already been said, that insistence
upon the minimum wage would doubtless reduce to idleness all
below the new margin, unless, indeed, as might happen in some
cases, the improvement in the standard of living of the lowest
workers increased their efficiency, or unless the imposition of
the additional burden on industry stimulated the discovery of
ncw methods or resources. In the one case we should have an
increase of productivity of labor; in the other, of capital. In
either case the industry could pay the wage imposed. But we
could not hope that such a result would be general.
Looking at the matter from another angle, a minimum wage
which was not earned at the margin would reduce profit or interest,
or both, and react on the accumulation and investment of
capital. In time there would be inevitably a slackening of industry
and a reduction of employment. I see no logical escape
from the conclusion that a general minimum wage, or a minimum
wage imposed widely, if it were higher than the product of the
marginal worker, would act to curtail industry, check accumulation
and investment and induce unemployment.
Moreover, we must remember that if the state insists upon a
minimum wage and guarantees it, it also should guarantee efficiency.
There is no more justice in compelling the employer or
investor to abandon his profit or interest, if it is only legitimate
in amount, in order to raise wages than there is in permitting
unduly low wages to be paid in order to increase profit.
Any effort of the government to regulate prices, except to
see that they are not monopolistic or are not fixed by agreement
among other agents, is open to criticism for reasons somewhat
similar to those given against the minimum wage proposition.


### ---Economics-1914-0-09.txt---
There is no more economic reason for fixing prices to enable labor
to get a fair wage or the consumer to get a "fair price" than
there is to fix prices in order to enable the investor to get a
"lair interest." There may be reasons for doing both, if it
were practicable. But the practicability is doubtful because of
tlEe complexity and changeableness of the factors involved. The
government and its agents have no means of determining beforehand
the effects of any particular line of action on prices. They
could not fix prices fair to investors, workers, and consumers
without knowing costs and conditions of markets and a multitude
of other things which are changing from day to day, and
which, if they could be discovered and set down in figures, would
be beyond the understanding of anybody but the expert in business.
Nor could they allow for foreign competition. The attempt
would very likely check accumulation and investment. We
have a good illustration of the possible effects of such an attempt
in the railroad situation in the United States at present.
If the application of the minimum wage doctrine and price
regulation in any large way should curtail industry and increase
unemployment, the government would be called on to provide for
an increasing number of people out of work. The number thus
to be taken care of would doubtless grow in time, not only from
industrial causes, but froin the stimulation to population which
would come from a lowering of the moral fiber of the people. For
the easier it is made for one part of society to get a living at
the expense of another part of society, the larger will be the dtc--
mand for it and the lower the moral tone of those who demand
it. A recent illustration of this fact is found in the effects of
Germany's thirty years' experience with insurance against sickness
and accidents. Cheating, malingering, and even a certain
physical degeneration, have become widespread, so that many
though-tful people are alarmied at the weakening of the moral
fiber of the nation, and the sapping of its physical vigor.
From the point of view of economic theory, the proposals, especially
with reference to the minimum wage, involve a new ethics
and a new economic law of distribution. Broadly speaking, every
theory of wages is, first, an explanation of existing conditions,
and, second, an attempted justification of them. Each theory
has been accepted so long as its practical result was consonant
with the prevailing ideal of the general welfare, which means
acceptable to the multitude or group or class in power.


### ---Economics-1914-0-10.txt---
The productivity theories have led us to say that each participant
in production is entitled to and gets what he produces, for
the reason that tlhis has seemed to us good ethics. Now society,
in establishing a standard of wages, would assume the theory
that each must get what is necessary to enable him to attain a
living conformable to the dignities and requirements of citizenship.
The proposal is not, "to each one what he produces," but,
"to each one what he needs," on a minimum basis. The British
Minimum Wage Law for miners frankly recognizes this fact. The
ideal of the federation of miners was defined by its representative
in these words: "What their demands stipulated was that when
a man went into the pit to work . . . he should be assured of a
day's wage, fixed and agreed to, and if this was not granted it
should be recoverable through a court of law. No matter what
the collier's failure or difficulty might be in earning his money,
whether it be through faults, breakages in machinery, inundations
of water, shortage of tubs, overcrowding, or a walk of long distances
to the face; if he was not addicted to idleness, then he
should be allowed a fixed minimum wage." "The descending of
the pit and the remaining at the coal face to do a day's work
shall establish the right of the workman to receive the average
wage of the district."
If this policy should become general, the ultimate result would
be the elimination of those who cannot earn the minimum and the
rising of the margin of production for labor to a point where
the product of labor will be equal to the minimum wage fixed by
lawr. In other words, we will have a return to the theory of
specific productivity. No other result is possible.
In passing from my criticism of these proposals, however, I
would remind you that it does not involve the regulation of wages
and prices where these are themselves subject to control by any
class to the detriment of another. Aside from this limitation the
wisdom of government interference in these directions is more
than doubtful.

There is ground for more favorable comment on proposals
that the government shall, within limits, determine the form of
organization and the size of business enterprises. Industries
which are monopolistic in their character are now by general
consent regarded as properly subject to government supervision.
It is not necessary here to discuss the methods or extent of
this supervision further than to say that if it is to be permanently


### ---Economics-1914-0-11.txt---
successful it must aim to protect the interests of wage
earners, the investing public, and the general public, alike. It
mnust not permit undue profit from excessive rates, or from exploitation
of labor. In this field, however, the limits and methods
of government intervention are being slowly worked out, although,
of course, with considerable friction and many jars.
The regulation of public utilities and industries of similar economic
character is an illustration in point.
Supervision may take the form either of inspection and publ.
city of procedure, or of direct attempts to influence the form
of organization. The former method has been recommended by
President Taft's Railroad Securities Commission, and wherever
it has been applied its results have been good, even if they
have not cured all the evils. But we may reasonably ask for
more than this, at any rate in many cases. The prohibition of
what we may call interlocking directories, of stock watering, rebates,
price discrimination, and the holding of the stock of one
corporation by another, and the elimination or limitation of holding
companies, are some of the things that may well be
accomplished.

Aside from industries that are clearly monopolistic by nature
the whole aim of government interference should be to establish
conditions which will induce healthy competition. The government
should attempt to determine what constitutes, under existing
conditions, an efficient unit, or an efficient size, of a business.
It has been claimed for the trusts that they were more efficient as
producers and distributors than similar enterprises in the
same line. I do not feel that this claim has been established,
and think that there are signs that it is largely untrue. The
economies of big business have been secured at an economic and
social cost that has not been fully evident or fully understood.
T'here is reason for thinking that the dissolution of the tobacco
trust has already recovered to society some valuable entrepreneur's
talent which was being suppressed by the discharge of clerical
duties under the trust, and has induced competition among those
of this order of business talent with some resulting shaving of
prices to the consuming public. Even if it were true that the
biggest business is the most efficient in the sense that the cost of
its unit output is lowest, it does not follow that we should permit
that system of industry to exist. For we can tolerate only that
system which, whatever its mere econoiimic merits, is not likely to


### ---Economics-1914-0-12.txt---
destroy political liberty or economic opportunity. "The best
size of unit for general welfare is the thing for us to establish,
not necessarily the one which has the largest output or the
lowest unit cost."

Moreover, there is justification for fixing a maximum financial
unit of business, aside from the question of greatest operating
efficiency. For even if competition, working as it does with considerable
friction, fixes a price that is a fair return of capital
invested, this is not enough for the protection of the public if
the capital invested becomes larger than is adequate to performii
the total service needed. If it goes beyond this, a "fair" return
necessitates a price larger than the value of the product to the
community, and economic friction, to say nothing of monopolistic
control, sometimes makes it possible to secure such a price.
The fifth proposal in the program of government extension
policy is the imposition of greater burdens upon accumulated
wealth. This means a renewed emphasis on the social origin and
character of property and therefore on the right of limiting it,
not only to prevent unjust accumulation, but any accumulation
which in character or amount threatens the welfare of society.
This question is before the country now in the suit against the
Harvester Trust. According to the prosecution in this case, the
organization and power of the trust are such that "if the International
Harvester Company were disposed to exercise the power
its enormous wealth gives, and if it were left unrestrained to do
so, it could drive every competitor it has from the field." It is
necessary to notice that there is no new legal, ethical, or social
principle involved in this doctrine, although the wisdom of extending
the principle at present may be an open question.
Some general consequences of these proposals must not pass unnoticed.
Undoubtedly, a certain amount of good can be done
by proper supervision to prevent the oppression of the weak by
the strong and the impairment of the public welfare. It may
be true that, as one writer puts the matter, the present movement
is an attempt by the community to resume sovereign power in
order to conserve the right of the individual to make his living.
But bureaucratic supervision can never be a permanent substitute
for proper standards of righteousness among men in their dealings
with one another. We may have an honest and efficient
officialdom that puts the common weal above corporate and personal
interest, but we cannot have it for very long. The inherent


### ---Economics-1914-0-13.txt---
w-eakness of wide and intense government regulation is its lack
of motive to take advantage of new conditions to further progress;
whereas the inherent strength of a system of individual initiative
is the presence of that motive.
If any of the proposed policies is to win final success in improving
the condition of any class of society, or of all classes, it
can do so only by increasing the sense of responsibility of those
directly affected. For those who have made any study of attempts
to improve human society through long periods must feel
very deeply "how great is the ignorance of the wise, the weakness
of the strong, the folly of the prudent and the helplessness of the
well-meaning." They will realize that we "cannot sweep away any
one thing without upsetting innumerable other things, good, bad,
and indifferent."

The adoption of the policies that we have been discussing may
mean a period of comparatively stationary economic life. In so
far as we clip the wings of motive we impede rapidity of motion.
Yet it may be well sometimes to do this. For abundance, irrespective
of distribution, will not necessarily produce welfare.
What a nation may need may be an abundance sufficient for social
welfare according to definite ideals, even though it may not be so
great an abundance as with different ideals might be obtained.
It is true that progress in invention and discovery may still
go on if bureaucratic oversight should check industry. It will
do so, however, only if a sufficient margin of advantage is left
with the enterprising pioneer in the future as in the past. A
return to the intensive, minute, supervision over industry which
prevailed under the old mercantile system would defeat its own
purpose. Yet it is hard to tell where to stop when once we use
the arm of government for economic purposes. It is doubtful
whether in this country the public will endure the menace to liberty
involved in very intensive supervision. It is doubtful whether,
if the supervision were successful, we should be better off in the
long run, and we should have lost all the advantages that have
accrued to us under the great system of economic liberalism.
Although, then, there is good in the proposition for the extension
of government activity into business, the field of its operation
must be carefully limited. Can we, in conclusion, lay down
briefly some of the limits within which it should be confined?
I venture to suggest, first, that reasonable welfare legislation,
as has already been remarked, is accepted by the American public


### ---Economics-1914-0-14.txt---
as proper, and that our various governments may concern themselves
with extending this without objection.
In the second place, government may properly attempt a
delimitation and regulation of industries which are monopolies
by nature. It may also segregate those, if any, which are likely
to be most serviceable to the public and to their owners when
treated as monopolies. Although there is room for difference of
opinion on details, the principle is generally accepted now that
the private enterprises which commonly go under the name of
public utilities are best treated as monopolies to be carried on
under proper reasonable supervision.
In the next place, the government may properly continue its
policy of compelling the trusts to dissolve into their component
industries and of requiring big business enterprises to resolve
themselves into units of the most efficient size. To accomplish this
purpose properly, the government should undertake an investigation
of what constitutes a unit of greatest efficiency in the more
common big businesses. Having determined this, the law should
prevent the organization of businesses which will exceed this most
efficient unit in size unless the advance in the arts makes it possible
to prove that some larger or different organization is better,
in which case the law should be adapted to the new conditions.
Again, the utmost publicity compatible with the rights of business
should be given to the transactions of corporations, whether
monopolistic or other. But it is hard to justify the minuteness
of the inquiries which some of our commissions now propose into
various lines of business.
In the next place, the law may very properly forbid agreements
fixing prices by producers or distributors of goods. The law
miay further properly provide a minimum standard of wages for
industries in which labor is obviously exploited. Still further,
few will obj ect to reasonable increase in the burdens imposed
upon great aggregations of wealth for the general welfare, especially
when these aggregations of wealth have come from sources
that give them a large social element.
Finally, the attitude of our courts towards the character and
acts of corporations needs readjustment. There is some ground
for believing that from the point of view of the interests of society,
it was a mistake to give corporations the attributes of
personality. In any event, there is a demand that personal responsibility
for corporate acts shall be fixed upon the officers in


### ---Economics-1914-0-15.txt---
such ways as to prevent the recurrence of some of the evils that
have given rise to the hostility towards corporations.
One inevitable consequence of the establishment of the principle
of government control of economic life must not be lost
sight of even if its early appearance is unlikely. Regulation by
a government which is the people, for the people, tends to be
regulation of the people by a government in spite of the people.
IRegulation of industrial life in behalf of some means repression
of the activities of some others. The government, as such, once
recognized as having a right to regulate economic conditions,
will be pushed by the ruling class or classes towards regulation
or control of the rights of others in politics, religion, and other
ways; for economic privileges or rights cannot crystallize into
custom and be cast into law in behalf of some as against others
without imposing upon the "some" corresponding duties which
become privileges or rights of the "others." This process means
a slow crystallization of economic status and the production of
classes in society.

These, then, are the principal lines of proposed wider government
activity at present before the public, in this country and in
England. Their significance is far reaching. While declaring
no new legal principle, they give a different color to accepted
doctrine. The emphasis is now lo be put upon the rights of the
community in private property and to private property, rather
than on those of the individual owner. The movement means that
the acquirement of property to an extent that may endanger the
public welfare is to be restricted. Laws should be framed, we are
told, to care for the worker rather thian for industry. In other
words, the new movement is an attempt to establish by authority
the individualism-conditions of welfare-which individual action
itself has failed to achieve. The whole movement imports a lessening
of the importance of private property, and a strengthening
of the importance of men; an emphasis of public weal as against
private gain; a demand for more equality in economic conditions,
and greater social responsibility for wealth.

As Bacon centuries ago taught men that "knowledge is to be
found by careful investigation of nature, not by spinning cobwebs,"
and "turned men from disputations of words to an observation
of the world around," so we are learning today for the first time
that economics is a science that has to do with the affairs of this
world and is not merely a part of abstract philosophy. Half a
century ago Mill was called severely to account for asserting that
while production rested on physical laws distribution rested on
the conventions of society. We are just beginning to find out how
wide of the mark the first part of this statement is, however true
within wide limits the latter may be.
Until within a decade or two economics was considered the science
of private pecuniary gain. Within very recent days the emphasis
has shifted from private gain to human welfare.
The traditional economics took definite shape at the moment
when the world was passing from one economic system, method
of production, and business organization to another. Its principles
were drawn almost entirely from the conditions then rapidly
passing away. They were posited on the condition of the independent
employer, who was at the same time skilled workman,
capitalist or owner of the instruments of production, and actual
director of industry. This was before the productive power of
the world was capable of producing a large surplus wealth. The
key to the industrial situation then was the trained independent
employer, working within the guild for his own account under the
rules formulated by the guild. The chief object of these rules
was to give every man an equal chance and to assure to him the
rewards of his industry and skill. Capital, in that age, though
important was not a separate category. The philosophy did not
provide for a condition of affairs in which the mass of the workmen
were unskilled, working for wages, and the instruments of
industry were owned by another class of society, for the most part
devoid of technical knowledge. The main object of guild rules
was always general well-being and not capitalistic profits.


### ---Economics-1915-0-02.txt---
The present system is based fundamentally on competition, private
property, and individual freedom of contract. The universality
and beneficence of competition are assumed. It is also
assumed that when an individual pursues his own financial advantage
successfully he creates wealth, and that, under competition,
this wealth will be widely if not equally diffused and the community
will thereby benefit. This teaching remained virtually
unshaken in theory and universal in practice, so far as the organization
of society was concerned, to something like a generation
ago.

Meantime, the surplus wealth, due to the industrial revolution
and the universal application of machinery, had enormously increased
and these economic doctrines had become thoroughly
crystalized into a body of positive law and institutions. Nowhere
else was the system so thoroughly entrenched in law as in the
United States under the constitutions, federal and state. Granted
the underlying assumptions of this school and it logically followed
that any conscious attempt to control the production, distribution,
or consumption of wealth was not only an unwise and unjust interference
with natural forces, but was sure to work injury in
practice by making worse the very evils it was aimed to lessen or
abolish.

This deprived society of a conscious aim and left the state like
a ship without a rudder. With the enormous increase of surplus
under such a system, it became increasingly advantageous to individuals
to control this surplus. The economic doctrines, the
principles of laissez-faire, together with the rapid development of
means of communication and transportation, quickened all movement.
Combination followed. Nor should it be forgotten that
until very recently the endless extent of free land and unappropriated
natural resources concealed the true condition of affairs
and the general tendencies of our civilization. At the same time,
the conditions of life were so easy for all that any attempt to
change the constitution of society or to reform the system fell on
deaf ears. The forces making for combination resulted in an unmistakable
trend toward monopoly and the passing into the control
of a few hands of the natural resources, the instruments of production,
and, above all, the sources of credit.
It became harder each year for any man to become an independent
undertaker of industry, or even to entertain a rational
hope of such achievement. This caused class cleavage and social


### ---Economics-1915-0-03.txt---
unrest. The keeping open of the gates of immigration, together
with the constant increase of automatic, or semi-automatic, machinery
made the profitable employment of a lower and lower
grade of workmen in our manufacturing industries possible. The
incoming of these hordes of various races, tongues, and religions,
prevented that effectual combination of labor which might have
done something in the absence of a strong government to check
the growing inequality of wealth and opportunity.
The interpretation of our constitution by which a corporate
charter became a contract and a corporation was endowed with
all the more important economic characteristics and rights of a
natural person, destroyed competition as a controlling factor in
industrial life. Lax corporation laws supplemented by liberal interpretation
of the same by the courts, led the corporations to
combine under various forms and to enter into gigantic trusts and
combinations.

When the American Economic Association was formed about a
quarter of a century ago, the prevailing system of economics
taught that the state or organized society as such had nothing to
do with economics, although it must be said to the credit of some
of the founders that they protested vigorously against such doctrines.
Economics was considered, in the English speaking world,
a purely abstract philosophy-an a priori science. The sole
function of the state was to preserve law and order, and to prevent
physical violence to persons and injury to property. Under the
assumption of individual liberty, freedom of contract, free and
beneficent competition, whatever wrong existed would tend to right
itself. Hence, society, as such, need not concern itself consciously
about the conditions of production or distribution. Contrary to
the theory, this beautiful system of abstract philosophy never had
any very close relation to the actual world of affairs at any time,
or in any place. But the increasing inequality of wealth and
opportunity drove the the actual world every day farther and farther
away from the prevailing theory of economics. Competition
never applied as completely in any nation or community as the early
economists implied, for the simple reason that to be effective competition
must be between units of substantially equal bargaining
power. This means not only the equal personal liberty of the contracting
parties, on which we have laid so much stress, but it also
calls for substantially equal intelligence, knowledge, and economic
well-being. In other words, each party must be free to enter into a


### ---Economics-1915-0-04.txt---
given contract, or to refuse to do so, as the one result or the other
promises him more advantage. The fact that one of the parties
enters into a contract that he knows will be generally disadvantageous
to him because he feels that if he refrains from entering
into it he will be worse off than if he accepted it, fulfills neither the
idyllic suppositions of the economists nor the legal conception of
freedom of contract.
In the first flush of individual liberty, population was small,
capital was limited and largely held in individual hands. Under
the then existing circumstances the facilities did not exist for combined
action or for freedom of contract. Nor was any attempt,
in fact, ever made to bring within the area of freedom of contract
any considerable portion of the population living at any one time
in any community. First, freedom of contract arose in the days
when the major portion of mankind was not free in the sense implied
by the term freedom of contract. They were living in a condition
of semi-freedom, or status, more or less free according to our
standards, but nevertheless restricted in many ways. In many
communities, even the most advanced, a large part of the population
were in actual slavery. They of course were excluded.
Women, minors, idiots, and many other classes were shut out from
this sacred precinct.
But it was not until the days of capitalistic industry and the
enormous surplus resulting therefrom, with the consequent class
cleavage and the creation of the great wage-earning, non-propertied
classes, that we began to discover that the majority of the personally
free adult males, because of economic conditions, were quite
as unfree economically as many of those whose personal freedom
was limited by law.

Furthermore, it may be questioned whether or not the mere
growth of fixed capital, in the absence of all other considerations,
does not fix a definite limit to the effectiveness and beneficence of
competition. I take it that the Ricardian doctrine of competition
rests fundamentally on the belief that when two competitors
attempt to supply the same market with a given commodity the
price of that commodity will finally be cut to the point at which
the most efficient can still sell at a profit, while the less efficient
will find that price unremunerative. It further assumes that when
that condition is reached the less efficient can, and will, withdraw
his capital and labor and apply them to some other industry which
promises at least the average reward or profit prevailing in the


### ---Economics-1915-0-05.txt---
community. But if such an inefficient competitor is not in a condition
to make this change without'total or even great loss, competition
has to that degree ceased to be effective. Under such
conditions, until the existing fixed capital is worn out, or until
demand has increased, by the growth of society, so as to require the
use of both plants at profitable prices, attempts at so-called competition
are not competition at all in the Ricardian sense, and
have none of the virtues ascribed to competition as the natural
regulator of industry and as a protector to the consumer. In the
face of these facts we invent various doctrines of so-called monopolies
and begin to consider these exceptions to our rules.
But the taking of the so-called utilities, including the common
carriers, out of the categories of competition and freedom of contract,
does not bring the readjustment of the doctrines of private
property into consonance with the popular ethical sentiments relating
to the rights of property in a rapidly growing and changing
civilization. Therefore, just as the decision (Chisholm vs. Georgia,
1793) that a citizen may sue a state was answered immediately by
an agitation for amendment prohibiting such suit, and within four
years by the adoption of such an amendment, so immediately
after the Dartmouth College case the people began to forbid, by
constitutional amendment where that seemed practicable, and by
general statutes where amendment was difficult, the granting of
any corporate charters without the specific reservation on the part
of the legislature to alter, amend, or appeal the same. This, of
course, did not reach charters previously granted.
In the absence of a constitutional amendment, it remained for
the courts to step in and relax the rigors of the Dartmouth College
case by strained interpretation. This was done by introducing the
doctrine of the police power, which is by implication superimposed
upon and made a part of all contracts. The New York courts
entered first upon this practice, but it was taken up within a
decade by the federal Supreme Court. This was a great extension
and an entirely new application of the police power.' The full
significance however of such application did not appear until more
than a generation later.
This doctrine cut deep into the theory of the Dartmouth College
case; but, what is much more significant, it placed once for all, until


### ---Economics-1915-0-06.txt---
the Supreme Court reverses itself, or until the constitution is
amended on this point, the power to determine public policy,
and consequently the content and extent of contract and private
property, in the hands of the court instead of the legislature, or
more popular branch of the government. It is interesting to speculate
as to what might have happened in a few decades if the doctrine
of contract as laid down in the Dartmouth College case could
have been maintained, and the courts had not dragged in the
police power as a serious modification and mollification of that
doctrine.

But even such a change did not keep the doctrine up to the
changing popular ideas of the right of contract and of private
property. The country found relief once more in a genuine political
revolution under Jackson, which issued in the reconstruction
of the court under Chief Justice Taney. When the first test case
came before the reorganized court (Charles River Bridge case,
1837), it was seen at once by the court that the application of
the Dartmouth College case would neither satisfy public opinion
nor permit the proper development of New England, save on the
sole condition that the people of Massachusetts would be willing to
tax themselves to compensate the owners of the Charles River
bridge for a property which had actually been destroyed when the
legislature chartered the defendant company to build a parallel
bridge, which, under the terms of the charter, had already become
free before this decision was rendered.
But the people of Massachusetts believed that the first bridge
company had received an adequate compensation for the use of its
property and for all the effort and risk ever incurred, and was,
therefore, not justly entitled to compensation. In the popular
judgment the company had been unduly greedy, and for private
gain had checked and prevented the necessary and desirable development
of the community. Under these circumstances there
was nothing for the court to do but to sustain the popular opinion
of Massachusetts, and thereby confiscate the property of the
Charles River Bridge Company, by an interpretation that can
scarcely be squared logically with the Dartmouth College case,
or with the earlier decisions in regard to ferries and toll bridges.
Much more striking illustrations appear in our history of the
fact that you cannot by any written constitution, or fiction of holding
popular opinion in check, in fact, maintain a form or content
of private property indefinitely in opposition to a well formed and


### ---Economics-1915-0-07.txt---
deliberate public opinion; or, as a distinguished lawyer has stated
it, you cannot compel a sovereign state or a whole people to be
moral against its will.
But we are reminded that the wisdom of our fathers decreed by
constitutional enactment that when, by changing popular sentiment,
the public demands that what is now property legally
acquired ought no longer to be property under the changed ethical
standards, the state should in a constitutional, orderly, and legal
manner, expropriate that property, and pay full value to its present
owners. But the object of private property and the sacredness
of contract is said to be to give to individuals the ability to count
on the future to a degree that will justify them in carrying on
production and making an effort to acquire property, and if such
an assurance cannot be given under some form of constitutional
provision production will cease and civilization will disappear.
Granted that morality requires such a doctrine, and that confiscation
is therefore unethical; yet, where public sentiment no longer
permits that to be property which is recognized as property under
the present constitution and laws, the doctrine is vain so long as
you cannot compel the whole people to act against its will. Perhaps
the remedy for this evil is not an attempt at compulsion by
law, but genuine moral education.
If then, we admit for the sake of argument that the content of
property will change, and ought to change from time to time, as
the needs of society change, and that no person and no class of
persons ought to be allowed to hold anything as property when
such holding has come to be harmful to the common weal, let us
see how the matter of compensation in such cases has been dealt
with in the past. This may enable us in some measure at least to
forecast the future, and possibly to avoid serious difficulties.
If we cannot compel a nation to act against its will, whether that
will be good or bad, can we force it to grant compensation in cases
where the night to property in the particular thing is no longer
permitted by public opinion? Is is not probable that the degree to
which compensation can actually be enforced in any case will depend
on the extent of the gap at any time which separates actual
conditions from the public judgment of what the present public
welfare demands?2

I "The substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly corresponds so
far as it goes with what is then understood to be convenient: but its form
and machinery and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results
depend very much upon its past."-O. W. Holmes, Jr., The Common Law,, p. 1.


### ---Economics-1915-0-08.txt---
If constitutional arrangements are such as to enable a frequent
and easy adjustment at any time, it is probable that the mass of
its rights, and consequently the value involved, will in any one
instance be so small that a community will be willing for the sake
of the added security and the encouragement to labor and investment
to expropriate those rights and pay full compensation. But
where property is concentrated in a few hands, or where property
has been protected by constitutional provisions to such a degree
as to make a change of law difficult, if not impossible, and where
that property has been enabled, by what is popularly considered
unjust if not illegal means, to prevent the necessary constitutional
and legal changes for a long enough time to allow the mass of
property condemned by the moral sentiment to become enormous,
is it likely that the public will consent to tax itself to pay compensation
on the necessary scale?
Nor can one psychological consideration be safely overlooked,
namely, that the longer such a condition prevails the more the
owners of such property become convinced not only that they are
right, and legally and morally entitled to such property, but, still
more important, they come to believe that they can in fact maintain
their possession by the old means indefinitely. Therefore the
proposition for expropriation with compensation falls on deaf
ears, and is regarded as an invasion of their most sacred rights by
those who consider themselves strong enough to maintain such
rights. Under such circumstances abolition with full compensation
is fought almost if not quite as bitterly as direct confiscation.
Does anyone believe that the owners of nomination boroughs in
England in 1832 would have been willing to give up their property
rights in such boroughs, involving their whole political existence,
for a money consideration? And yet Lord Eldon said they were
as much property rights, "as your lordships' peerages and titles."
Or, would the American slave holders, after 1850, have listened
to a proposition to free their slaves for any amount of money?
Or, does anyone believe that the liquor interests in America today
would consent for a money compensation to have all their property
expropriated, and their owners thus deprived of their present
control over political life, vice, and crime? Or, has Mr. Rockefeller'
s utterances led us to believe that he and the other coal
owners of Colorado would give up their rights "to protect their
employees in their rights of individual bargaining against the labor

these rights too closely bound up in the minds of their owners with
the political control that affects all vested rights?
In the light of history, it will, perhaps, be admitted by all that
no large body of property, whether it be the public office or slaves
of bygone days, or the saloons of today, can exist indefinitely
against a growing sentiment that such property is injurious to
the welfare of society as a whole. It is probable that no constitutional
or legal forms can save such property. Furthermore, if
such property is maintained for generations by what the public
considers immoral means, and until the burden of compensation
would stagger the public, it is doubtful whether the public will
even offer compensation. This is more likely to be the case where
the property is of such a nature (as in the case of slavery) that
public sentiment will not allow the compensating body to recoup
the price paid by the further use of the thing as property.
If these premises be correct, does the question not come down
simply to this, whether when the issue is forced the owners will
consent to a gradual and peaceful modification of property rights
without compensation? If not, the alternative would seem to be
the final appeal to force. This brings us to the primitive doctrine
that one is entitled to such property only as he is physically able
to defend and hold. But such a condition carries us out of the
realm of law into that of mere might and reduces us to a state of
nature. No one who understood the situation would want to maintain
a constitutional form that reduces us to this condition. This
means the abandonment of law and a shifting of the economic
equilibrium by force as in the Peasants' Rebellion of 1381. In the
case of the abolition of the monasteries under Henry the Eighth,
as also of the political reforms in England, 1832, the property
owners were better advised and consented, very unwillingly it is
true, to a shifting of the economic power to other classes by more
or less peaceful means. This of course involved a large modification
of property rights as well as of political rights, and, in fact,
a large confiscation of private property. The reforms offer a close
parallel to the prohibition movement of today with its direct
confiscations.

The control of government has always given content and meaning
to property rights for determining the distribution of wealth
among the different classes of society. In America today those
in control of our concentrated wealth find themselves apparently
entrenched behind an almost unamendable constitution, based upon


### ---Economics-1915-0-10.txt---
the eighteenth century's interpretation of natural rights, freedom
of contract, individual liberty and competition. They seem to
think that having worked this constitution into a form where the
court is the actual determiner of public policy, and the consequent
definer of the rights of property, this condition can be maintained
indefinitely.

The attempt to justify the exercise of this power by the courts
rather than by the legislatures, is based on the theory that the
courts are the safest organ of society, because they are out of
politics. The exact contrary is the fact, as can be easily determined
by a reference to our own history, as well as to that of Great
Britain. The people will always accomplish their ends in the long
run, through political agitation and governmental action.
The courts are less well informed in regard to public opinion
and sound public policy than the legislatures. The whole effect
of turning such a power over to the courts is not to maintain the
status quo, or to prevent changes in property rights, but simply
to hold those changes in check and to delay them until peaceful
settlement becomes much more difficult, if not impossible. Chisholm
vs. Georgia led quickly to a constitutional amendment. The introduction
of the police power by the courts of New York made the
New York judiciary elective in 1846. The Dred Scott decision
was wiped out by blood and treasure. The declaring of the income
tax unconstitutional twenty years ago resulted in constitutional
amendment. The decisions on hours of labor, sanitation, and the
like, such as Lochner vs. New York, have led to a universal demand
that the people shall have direct political power over the courts.
This takes the form of an agitation for the recall of judges, or for
the recall of judicial decisions on constitutional questions. The
decisons in the railroad rate cases by which so many statutes have
been declared unconstitutional have intensified the popular movements
for direct popular control of the courts. The recent trust
decisions and the "rule of reason" evoke a demand for the limitation
of the power of the courts by statute or by constitutional
amendment.

It remains to be seen whether or not the courts will formally
reverse themselves,-whether as a result of the agitation they will
become very much more sensitive to popular opinion and come to
understand it better, and reverse themselves in fact but not in
form, or whether we shall have by constitutional amendment an
elective federal judiciary for limited term, perhaps accompanied


### ---Economics-1915-0-11.txt---
by the objectionable recall of judges or of constitutional decisions,
or both. The doctrine that in a democracy the courts can maintain
property interests unchanged for any considerable time, and
more particularly the property interests of large concentrated
wealth, against a well settled and determined public opinion, without
grave dangers meantime, seems highly doubtful.
Be that as it may, it will always remain true that the right to
determine public policy is a political right-in fact the most important
and fundamental political right-over which the public is
unwilling to surrender control.
The question then is, whether or not we are to keep our courts
in politics, and make them a football of partisan activity, or
whether we are to recognize once for all that the determining of
public policy is a political function, and that the legislature is a
more trustworthy political organ than the courts for such a
function.

There is no higher or more important public function than the
impartial administration of justice between man and man, and the
enforcement of the law. That the courts ought to be removed
from political influences all right-minded men admit. That this
can be easily accomplished the English experience proves. It is a
very significant fact that in the recent reconstitution of the Eng7
lish House of Lords by which it was effectually shorn of its political
powers, no suggestion even was made to deprive that House of its
judicial powers, for the simple reason that none but the judges
took part in the legal decisions, and the judges confine themselves
to declaring and enforcing the law and do not try to make the law.
But the judges can never be removed from political attack and
party influence in this or any other country so long as the chief
political function-the determining of public policy-is performed
by the courts.

The present system does not, in fact, adjust the public policy
satisfactorily to the actual needs of the day. It tends, rather, to
preserve the form adapted to a strictly pioneer organization of
society based on economic equality and free land, while we are
actually living in a marvelously complex civilization, with great
inequality and with our natural resources already appropriated.
Should the present decline in real wages continue for many years,
the tension is likely to become very great, for inequality, with the
consequent lack of bargaining ability, tends to increase at an everaccelerating
rate.


### ---Economics-1915-0-12.txt---
One phase of this situation found no consideration in the days
of laissez-faire, and has in fact but very recently attracted attention.
By this I mean that when inequality of bargaining power
has reached that point where competition is highly unequal we have
exploitation of the weak by the strong, without any violation of
law. Again, under our theories of competition we actually depress
the weaker members of society to a point at which we kill the goose
that lays the golden egg by preventing these people from becoming
and remaining efficient workers, and still more by preventing them
from bringing up their children with sufficient general skill and energy
to enable the economic production of the nation to be kept up.
Nor is this an evil that either cures, or even tends to cure, itself in
the absence of a strong, conscious social action on the part of the
state. Hence, the widespread agitation for a legal minimum wage
as a basis of maintaining the American standard of living. How
strange it would seem to the economists of even half a century
ago, with the theories then held of property rights and competition,
to come upon such a book as Hollander's The Abolition of
Poverty. For the economists of half a century ago believed that
"the poor we have always with us" and that poverty is as necessary
as profits as a spur to economic production. Under that
philosophy hunger and the fear of starvation gave the same motivation
to economic effort on the part of the poor as profits gave to
the capitalist.

The earlier economists would doubtless be equally shocked by
such a book as Ely's Property and Contract, which maintains that
property is a social creation, and a social concept, and that private
property should be neither acquired nor used in a manner injurious
to the public welfare. The earlier economists would have deserted
their ship had they come upon Taussig's statement that private
property is now on trial and that its sole justification is that it
conduces to the economic and social welfare of the people, and that
the day is already come when private property with its existing
rights and liniitations can no longer be assumed, but must prove its
right to further existence. This is an entire shifting of the burden
of proof from the not remote days when private property with its
present connotation was assumed without any question.
Perhaps the early economists would fail entirely to understand
such a book as Hobson's Wealth and Welfare: a Human Valuation,
or Veblen's The Instinct of Workmanship,-the first attempting
to prove the necessity of an entire shifting of the emphasis


### ---Economics-1915-0-13.txt---
from private gain to public welfare, that is, social well-being, and
the latter undertaking to prove that present methods of production
are at cross purposes with the controlling and impelling
instincts of mankind.
For centuries we have had now and then such books, but never
before by professional economists of standing. Yet these are the
books that are today not only receiving the most popular attention,
but the ones that are actually marking out the path, however
imperfectly, which economics must follow if it is to be more than
a system of intellectual gymnastics or to have any effect on practical
life.

Our free land has heretofore obscured the real tendencies of our
economic development. This fixed, on the one hand, a definite
minimum below which economic well-being could not be pressed and
thus maintained a definite standard of life. On the other hand, it
offered opportunities to vast numbers of people to make individual
fortunes, and thus to rise to the capitalistic class. This kept alive
that speculative spirit and hope so conducive to energy, enterprise,
and economic efficiency and production.
The wage system as at present interpreted in our legal doctrines
with the gates of opportunity closed by the complete appropriation
of natural resources and by the weakened bargaining power of the
individual in the uneducated, non-propertied, working classes, presents
quite a different spectacle. These changed conditions raise
questions of vast import.
We have passed recently, slowly, haltingly, and against great
obstacles presented by the courts, to legislation protecting women,
children, and finally adult men, as to accidents, workmen's compensation,
hours, and conditions of employment. However, the
final attitude of the courts on much of this legislation remains to
be worked out. But whatever the final view of the courts on
workmen's compensation and the minimum wage may be, the economists
and the general public, at least, have made up their minds,
once and for all, that so far as these subjects are concerned the
working classes are no longer subject to helpful or beneficent competition
or the freedom of individual contract. We have very
grudgingly admitted the usefulness of the collective bargaining
brought about by labor unions as a necessary and desirable brake
to check by united action the further disturbing of this equilibrium
until we can develop a state which is strong enough to represent
the social welfare and insure the progress of the nation. Competition


### ---Economics-1915-0-14.txt---
will always play an important role in human affairs, but it
remains beneficent only when society, acting through a state
stronger than the strongest individual or organized group of individuals
acting together, makes the rules of the game and sees to it
that pigmies are not permitted to fight with giants.
To those who have watched the inability of the laboring classes
to compete individually without results disastrous to them and
through them to the public in general, it must be plain that could
our present legal organization be maintained for a few generations
our attempts at unrestrained competition under it would mean
practical if not legal slavery for the non-propertied classes of
today and their descendants. Under such circumstances, if the
depressed classes were unable to throw off the yoke by force civilization
would die for lack of sustenance. For the experience of
mankind shows that no subject population limited to a given territory
can, or will, produce enough economic goods to support or
sustain itself. If, under such a condition of subjection the population
should become stationary, and peace could be maintained, we
should then have all the conditions for a civilization based on
slavery, and able to continue its existence by means of forced labor
alone.3

Our legal system of private property, with its present connotation,
has its chief defense in the doctrine that private property
is necessary in order to give a sufficient motivation for economic
activity and production on a large enough scale to maintain a
progressive or even stationary population. But with the exhaustion,
or appropriation, of our natural resources to a point
where, at present, one cannot avail himself of such resources unless
he possesses considerable capital, it appears that, if our present
legal organization is to continue, the hope of ever bettering their
status will soon fade from the consciousness of the whole working
population. When the laboring people obtain sufficient information
of the actual conditions, the motivation to industry offered by
the chance of owning private property will no longer influencl
them. And as these classes already constitute the overwhelming
majority of population in every industrial nation, this argument
for the existence of private property defeats itself; for if the hope
of acquiring private property be the chief motive for economic production,
and, if the great majority of our people are shut out from
such hope, production must cease unless it is kept up under some


### ---Economics-1915-0-15.txt---
other motive,-that is, under compulsion. In fact, the wage system
as based on individual bargaining, under our present interpretation
of individual private contract and private property, is as
inevitably doomed as African slavery was doomed in the United
States in 1860. For if private property is to be preserved as a
necessary inducement to energy, thrift, and economic production,
society must be so organized as to present that appeal to more
than an infinitesimal and ever-decreasing portion of the population.
The possibility of attaining the goal is at present too remote from
the consciousness of the vast majority of mankind to have the
desired effect.

This is not the time or the place to suggest a specific remedy
for this evil. It is probable that a solution will be found only after
a multitude of experiments in many directions, such as cooperation,
profit sharing, education, and the like, many of which in the
nature of the case must prove failures.
Whatever the final outcome may be it must accomplish two
important results: it will give the workman a conscious share in
the direction of the industry; and it will also, in addition to a guaranteed
minimum wage that may as Hobson suggests be regarded not
as wages but as cost, give him a share in the speculative gains or
profits of the industry. So much is required to keep up the efficiency
of production and to keep the workmen from sinking to
the inefficiency of servile labor.
Nor does the tradition that anyone can acquire property under
the present system, or the isolated instances of poor men who have
become rich, negative this conclusion. The fact is that we have
too recently escaped from a condition of abundant free land and
substantial equality of wealth and opportunity resulting from
and accompanying these unappropriated natural resources, to
make any such historical examples pertinent to the present inquiry.
It is pretty well agreed today that in the absence of specific and
conscious social action, working through the state, social classes
tend not only to perpetuate themselves, but, as time goes on, to
become more and more consciously guided by class motives.
In the absence of such social action the United States now
offers the most striking field for maintaining and perpetuating such
classes. First, we have the greatest degree of inequality; next,
we have the highest degree of rapid movement, at the same time
that our large vested interests have already learned to act as a unit


### ---Economics-1915-0-16.txt---
to a greater degree than elsewhere, while our legal system of
checks and balances prevents the government from holding such
interests in check.

With our concentrated wealth and large-scale production, m
the absence of a wise and conscious social policy, increased population
and consequent rise in rents will tend to shut out an everincreasing
part of the population from dominion over or ownership
in the natural resources and implements and tools of production.
The vague phrases, fortunately heard less frequently than
formerly, about the rich becoming richer and the poor poorer,
whether true or not, have no bearing on this point. Experience
has demonstrated that the whole system of individualism and individual
bargaining places the weaker members of society, when left
to their own individual devices, in such a position as to prevent not
only their improving their economic status but even their maintaining
their present position. Furthermore, the degree to which concentrated
control of wealth has already gone tends to make the
parties more and more unequal in bargaining power. Hence it
becomes easier and easier for the concentrated wealth to increase
the distance between the two classes, while the ability of individuals
to pass from one class to another grows constantly less. The tendency
of all natural forces, under present conditions, is to crystallize
and intensify class distinctions.
The present form of organization drives more and more women
and children into industry, the proportion of women gainfully
employed to the whole number of persons so employed having
increased from 13 per cent in 1870 to 21.2 per cent in 1910,
while recent figures from the stock yards district of Chicago show
that out of 194 families, in 94 of which the father is the sole wage
earner, the fathers earn but 54.4 per cent of the total income.4 At
the same time that this influx of women and children into industry
is taking place, real, as distinct from money wages, have constantly
declined since 1906.6
The picture that I have drawn is not a pessimistic one. In the
spirit of the earlier economists, I have merely tried to point out
certain tendencies, and to show that if these tendencies were allowed
to work unimpeded certain results, not pleasant to contemplate,


### ---Economics-1915-0-17.txt---
would surely follow. I have presented a mere description
of what awaits us in the near future if our present legal system,
with its worn out individualism and doctrines of contract and
competition, could be retained for a considerable period. But
fortunately, as already indicated, it is neither socially desirable
nor practically possible to maintain this system unamended.
It is true that the economists have not yet formulated a definite
scheme of reform, and equally true that those who profit financially
by the present system think they are unalterably opposed to any
change. Nevertheless, all the more important economists have had
their faith in the existing system profoundly shaken. In fact, the
laissez-faire doctrine has been repudiated, hence the endless confusion
in economic doctrines and teaching in America today.
We have rejected the old and have not yet discovered and
formulated the new. We may still believe that wages are determined
by demand and supply, but we are all now convinced that
what the demand or what the supply will be at any particular time
depends largely on the customs, institutions, constitutions, and
laws of the land, and not on any merely abstract a priori, philosophical,
or metaphysical speculations as to the economic man. We
are now trying to work out such a social control over demand and
supply as to make them what it is socially desirable they should be.
Let us ask once more whether there are any natural forces that
can be relied upon to bring about the re'organization now admitted
to be necessary if we are to make economic and social progress.
Let us ask further whether such a needed readjustment means, as
we are so often told, the destruction of private property and even
of existing wealth, with the consequent decay of our civilization.
Does such a change necessarily involve socialism, communism, or
any other form of organization inconsistent with the maintenance
of private property, retaining in private property all the elements
which have in practice proved themselves conducive to the general
welfare?

The chief emphasis today is on human welfare. While we have
come to realize that we may at any one moment urge on our economic
production at such a rate as to destroy the possibilities of
similar production in the future, the doctrine of human welfare
as against the abstract doctrine of natural production and distribution
under a system of unrestrained competition simply means
such a change in our philosophy, and such a modification of
private property through law reform, as will put into operation


### ---Economics-1915-0-18.txt---
the doctrine that the state, representing society as a whole, must
have a definite social ideal, aim, and program; and that our economic
doctrines, aims, and methods must all fall within that
program and form a part of it. This aim may be stated as the
homely one that no one has a right to acquire, or to hold, or to use
private property in a manner injurious to others, or to the permanent
general interest of the society of which he is a part.
Theoretically, this doctrine has always been a part of the doctrine
of private property, but, unfortunately, we have assumed that
certain uses were not adverse to the public interest, because we
assumed that they could be brought under free competition, and
that having once come within these bounds they could not be
harmful. From this we concluded, therefore, that they were beneficial.
We are asking, therefore, today as never before, and with
great earnestness, what uses and practices are really advantageous
to the public, and whether or not, despite the old economists, when
one does that which brings financial gain to himself he does what
is best for the public.
We are even inquiring, contrary to the wisdom of our fathers,
whether the private citizen necessarily always knows his own
interest, and, most of all, if he does know it whether he is always
economically and politically situated where he can pursue that
private interest effectively.
The economists now, almost without exception, admit that our
present institutions, customs, and laws do permit on a large and
ever-increasing scale the use of individual and corporate property
in a way that is not consistent with or conducive to public welfare
and equality of opportunity.
Such reform implies a large modification of our constitutional
laws, and the democratizing of both politics and business in such
a manner as to do justice to all and to give every one an equal
chance in life and to see that every individual born into the world
has an opportunity to develop his physical, mental, social, and
spiritual powers to as high a degree as possible in view of the
existing power of man over matter, that is, of the general productive
power of the age and country in which he lives.
If economists do not take this view of the scope, methods, and
aims of economic study, they will find themselves entirely sidetracked,
and economics becomes merely an a priori or abstract
science, with no more relation to human welfare than speculation
about the planetary system has.


### ---Economics-1915-0-19.txt---
To sum up: The old system has broken down, not because competition
has disappeared or ceased to be important, but because
the increasing inequalities of wealth, with the added facilities for
combination, have made it impossible for the great mass of the
people to compete on equal terms. "Under present conditions,"
as Walker says, "the game is played with loaded dice." At the
same time, the constitution with its system of checks and balances
has not expanded rapidly enough to enable us to meet the changed
economic and social conditions satisfactorily. On the other hand,
centuries of free schooling, free right of assembly, free speech,
freedom of religious thought, extended suffrage, and the increased
means of transferring persons, goods, and intelligence, have increased
enormously the ability of the poorer classes to combine
for political action. From this it follows, logically, that so soon
as the dissatisfaction reaches a certain point political power must
pass to the majority,8 that is to the working and non-propertied
classes, whose members are becoming more and more class conscious.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the great inequality in fortune, the
working classes have sufficient interest in the outcome to give them
hope and courage to work together for a re6rganization of society.
In spite of great divergence of opinion among them, there is a
common feeling that, in the long run, economic reform can come
only through political action. It is inconceivable that they should
come into political power and not use that power for bringing
about, through the state, the only organization including all the
people, such economic changes as public opinion considers desirable
in the common interest. When this idea is broached, we hear
much of the danger of revolution, destruction of property, and
the decay of civilization.
As against such dire prophecies, certain considerations should
not be overlooked. First, the working people have been trained
in political action and self-restraint for too many generations, and
understand how much easier, safer, and more satisfactory such
action is than violence. In the next place, they have too much at
stake to risk it all on such a doubtful venture.
Notwithstanding the spectacle that Europe offers us today, the
a "It is a chimerical hope to overpower or outnumber the middle class whatever
modes of voting, whatever redistribution of the constituencies are really necessary
for placing the government in their hands. Those, whether we like it or
not, they will assuredly obtain."-J. S. Mill, Dis8ertations, II, p. 155.


### ---Economics-1915-0-20.txt---
American people in general have too high a degree of material
well-being to risk it in such a mad and unnecessary attempt.
Truly, the present war shows that people may still be induced to
fight for what they consider racial or national existence, or even
supremacy, but it is far from proving that they can be persuaded
or compelled to fight for the purpose of maintaining a mere definition
of property rights, and that too a definition that has already
been rej ected by the people who would in fact have to do with the
fighting and later pay the bills for the struggle. The average
American shrinks too much from the very idea of blood, slaughter,
pain, and hardship, to enter upon any such a wild and senseless
scheme.

On the other side, much as the concentrated vested initerests
believe they are wronged, they of all people shrink most from
personal encounter and hardship. They might be willing to encourage
fighting so long as they can control the government and
compel, or induce, other classes to do the actual fighting and pay
the bills for them, but the moment they see the control of government
passing by peaceful means from their hands the spirit of
fight and physical resistance fades away. The modern millionaire
and his satellites are plotting and scheming, not fighting, animals.
Still better, the more enlightened among our rich men have
already become convinced that the present situation is both undesirable
and untenable. All that they need is to be convinced
that any proposition promises real reform to cause them to throw
themselves heart and soul into it.
While the great mass of factory and other social legislation of
the past generation when rightly viewed is seen to be in strict
harmony with the thesis herein maintained, unfortunately it has
been heretofore generally regarded as a strict exception to a
general rule or theory. In fact, it is an essential part of the
modern theory of property and economics. It is based on the
fundamental idea that the community, if it is to adjust itself to
everchanging social circumstances, must have a distinct social aim
to be accomplished through the agency of the state.
Under this doctrine economics will no longer be the science of
private pecuniary gain resting upon a system of abstract assumptions,
but the science of men in an organized society, working
within a state with a conscious social purpose. Such a state will
be effective only as it is easily amenable to a wisely directed public


### ---Economics-1915-0-21.txt---
opinion, representing, at any time, a clear maj ority of the
community.7

It would seem to require no demonstration that a state politically,
or an economic organization within a state, cannot be considered
in stable equilibrium, or likely to endure unchanged, when
under a wide suffrage and extended political rights the majority of
the people want that system changed.
But this is not a disturbing thought. It means evolution, not
revolution; not abolition of private property, but the bringing
of the rights of private property into harmony with the
desires and needs of the age. No sudden or violent change or
destruction is needed, but a gradual, orderly, and peaceful modification
and adaptation of institutions, and consequently of economics,
to a modern, changed environment and to public welfare.

the origin of the American Economic Association, some thirty
years ago, the President selects for the theme of his annual address
either a fundamental economic problem or some phase of the relation
between economics and our social, political, educational, or
legal institutions. In breaking with this tradition I am taking a step
which requires an opening word of explanation. The reason underlying
the precedents and giving them their value is the principle
that the man whom the Association has honored should offer in
return whatever he has that seems most worthy of attention from
the Association and the public. But of that he must be the judge.
In the present case exceptional circumstances seem to justify an
unprecedented choice. A brief statement of the circumstances
may serve to secure for the subsequent argument a more indulgent
attention.

The presidents of a score of American universities were invited
some years ago by the Census Office to nominate graduate students
of economics, one from each institution, who might assist in the
study of various problems within its field of work. The Secretary
of the Economic Association, who was temporarily in the employ of
the Federal Government, had suggested that the invitation be given
and was responsible for the results. His position had grown
naturally out of his secretarial duties and was intended as a recognition
of an extended report and accompanying papers just published
by a committee of the Association.1
Somewhat more than a year after this group assembled in
Washington the results of the census of 1900 laid the basis for
the apportionment law of 1901 and members of the group prepared
for Congress the tables around which the prolonged discussion
centered. While following these congressional debates
they became interested in certain vexatious difficulties and anomalies
in the method of apportionment, for the solution of which


### ---Economics-1916-0-02.txt---
Congress naturally could not wait. So it cut the knot and turned
to other business. The decision which Congress reached was seemingly
devoid of justification in theory and had been rejected by all
trained students who had faced the problem. Twenty years earlier,
our first president, General Walker, had characterized a similar
solution as losing "all hold on any principle governing the matter."
During the following decade memnbers of the group continued a
spasmodic discussion of the apportionment problem among themselves
and with others, and, in 1910, when it again became urgent,
a solution had been worked out which could hardly have occurred
to any one of the group alone or to any member of Congress. The
solution commended itself to the House Committee on the Census,
aroused no opposition in House or Senate, and was speedilv followed
in the law. The fact that these members of our Association
have contributed to elucidate the difficult problem may justify the
choice of a themie remote from the field of economics as traditionally
interpreted.

A few months before the group was brought together the president
of the Association, in closing his annual address, had said:
"I believe that the largest opportunity of our economists in the
immediate future lies not in theories but in practice, not with students
but with statesmen, not in the education of individual citizens,
however widespread and salutary, but in the leadership of an
organized body politic.'
It is somewhat in the spirit of President Hadley's speech at New
Haven that I ask your attention to this theme. My immediate object
is to present the reasons for believing that the problem of
apportionment under the provisions of the Constitution, a technical
problem to which at intervals through more than a century the
attention of Congress, executive officers, and statistical experts
had been directed, with only temporary and provisional success, has
at length been solved by reconciling the demands of Congress with
the conditions imposed by theory. My remote object is to show
that the ground has been cleared for renewing under more favorable
auspices that effort to check the steady and rapid increase in the
size of the House of Representatives which was made in 1850 and
abandoned in 1870.

Only two provisions of the Constitution bear on the present
problem, one that "6representatives . . . shall be apportioned
among the several states . . . according to their respective numbers,"


### ---Economics-1916-0-03.txt---
and the other that "each state shall have at least one
representative."

Between 1790 and 1911, inclusive, two fundamentally different
methods of apportionment were employed, one method in seven
apportionments and the other in six. It is theoretically possible,
of course, that the two methods may be equally good or equally bad,
but probably one method is better than the other and possibly one
method is wrong and the o(ther right. The two methods differ in
that one, which I will venture to call the method of an assumed
ratio, starts from an assumed number of persons to one representative,
the number being usually but not necessarily a whole number
of hundreds or thousands; and the other. which, but for the fact
that it has long been called the Vinton method from the name of
the representative who introduced it, inight be named, in contrast
to the first, the method of a computed ratio, starts from an assumed
number of representatives in the House and computes the
average number of persons to a representative by dividing the
constitutional or representative population of the United States
by that number. The quotient is then used as a divisor for the
population of each of the states, a representative is apportioned
for each unit in the resulting series of quotients, the sum of which
under all ordinary circumstances is less than the number of representatives
to be apportioned, the remainders are arranged in order
of size, and a representative assigned to each in succession until the
desired total is secured. This method sometimes leaves one or more
mnajor fractions, or fractions larger than onie half, witlhout an additional
representative anid sometimes gives an additional representative
for one or more minor fractions, results which have been serious
stumbling-blocks to Congress but are inherent in the method.
The Vinton method was used at every census between 1850 and
1900, inclusive; the method of an assumed ratio was used at every
census between 1790 and 1840, inclusive, and again in 1910. The
latter method has taken two forms, one in which all fractions after
division are disregarded in the apportionment, and the other in
which all fractions larger than one half entitle the states wherein
they occur to an additional representative. These two may be
called the method of rejected fractions and the method of major
fractions.

After this preliminary clearing of the ground my main thesis
may be stated as follows: The method of major fractions is the
correct and constitutional method of apportionment.


### ---Economics-1916-0-04.txt---
To determine what is the correct and constitutional method a
test of correctness is needed. The requirement that representatives
shall be apportioned among the several states according to
their respective numbers cannot be strictly and exactly met. Probably
no two states ever have had or ever will have exactly the same
number of inhabitants to one representative. This fact does not
authorize Congress to disregard the constitutional mandate, but
does oblige it to interpret the phrase by reading into the Constitution
at this point the words "as near as may be," so that the requirement
means, representatives shall be apportioned among the
several states according to their respective numbers as near as
may be. This is the substance of the claim made by Daniel Webster
in his committee report to the Senate in 1832,3 which convinced
that body and ten years later convinced both Houses that
the method of apportionment which had been followed by Congress
theretofore was unsound, if not unconstitutional. A bill drawn in
conformity with Webster's position reached President Tyler in
1842. He finally signed it, but at the same time filed a memorandum
expressing doubts regarding the constitutionality of the innovation.
Since Tyler's day no serious dissent from Webster's position
has been expressed, I believe, either on the floor of Congress or
elsewhere, and it may be accepted as unchallenged. It affords one
criterion whereby the apportionment of representatives to any
state may be tested. If there is doubt, for example, whether State
A is entitled to ten or eleven representatives, three ratios are
needed: (1) the number of persons to one representative in State
A with ten representatives, (2) the same in State A with eleven representatives,
(8) the same in the United States. The nearness of
the first and second ratios to the third, or standard, is then measured,
whichever ratio is nearer to the standard is accepted, and
State A assigned the corresponding number of representatives.
This is the test and the only test which can be derived from
Webster's argument. It is of great help, but it does not completely
solve the problem.

A second test, to be set beside Webster's, is suggested by the
original object of apportionment. This was to give the more
populous states the larger representation in the House to which
their numbers were thought to entitle them and which they did
not receive in the Senate. From the fundamental purpose of apportionment


### ---Economics-1916-0-05.txt---
it follows that a method giving the populous states
systematically either more members or fewer members per unit of
population than the small states is incorrect.
We have, then, two criteria, of a just and constitutional apportionment:
first, the ratio in each state must be as near as may be
to the standard ratio; and, secondly, the method must hold the
scales even between the large and the small states.
The ratio either for the country or for a state is usually expressed
as the average number of persons to one representative.
For example, under the apportionment law of 1911 there were
211,877 persons to a representative. But for my purposes it is
better to conceive that each inhabitant of the country or of a state
has an equal interest in a representative and to express that interest
in the form of a decimal, such as .000005 or .0000047 or
.00000472. A further improvement gets rid of the long decimals
by taking a round number of people, say 10,000,000, as a unit
and computing the number of representatives to that unit. When
ratios are stated in this form, the meaning is more quickly grasped
through ear or eye and comparisons between two ratios are more
easily made.

Armed with these criteria of a correct apportionment, we are
in a position to approach the problem. Because of the historical
interest attaching to it I will first apply the tests to the apportionment
of 1832, the last made under the method of rejected fractions.
The ratio used in the bill before the House was one representative
to 47,000 people, which is equal to 213 representatives
to 10,000,000. Under this ratio Massachusetts was entitled to
12.99 representatives and the question before Congress was, Should
it receive 12 or 13? If it received only 12 representatives, it
would be at the rate of 197 to 10,000,000 people; if 1%9 it would
be at the rate of 213 to 10,000,000 people, the standard ratio.
Tried by Webster's test of nearness, then, Massachusetts was
entitled to 13 representatives and was defrauded by receiving only
12. It is not surprising that Edward Everett in the House and
Daniel Webster in the Senate joined in a vigorous, though in its
momentary effect an unsuccessful, onslaught upon a method which
led to such results.
They did not notice, however, and since that controversy ended,
no one, I believe, has remarked, that the system of rejecting all
fractions, even those as large as .99, confers an unjust advantage
in the long run upon the populous states, among which at the time


### ---Economics-1916-0-06.txt---
Massachusetts held a leading position. If there are eleven states,
one of 10,000,000 and ten of 1,000,000, and all remainders are rejected,
the chances are that the ten remainders of the small states
will in combination be several times as great as the one remainder
in the large state. Or in the case of Massachusetts in 1832, with
a ratio of one representative to 47,000 people and 12 representatives,
the apportionment against which Everett and Webster protested,
that state would have had, to be sure, only 197 representatives
to 10,000,000 people, far short of the standard 213; but the
smallest five states then in the Union, which together had a population
somewhat less than that of Mlassachusetts, would have received
only 172 representatives per 10,000,000 people. Massachusetts
would have fallen 16 below the standard, but they would
have fallen 25 below Massachusetts. Massachusetts would have
had a rejected fraction of .99 but they would have had rejected
fractions amounting in combination to 2.38.
To test the conclusion that the method of rejected fractions
favors the populous states I have reapportioned the House for
every decade between 1790 and 1840 by applying the method of
apportionment employed in 1910 to the conditions and compared
the results with those actually embodied in the laws. The states
which were given too many representatives between 1790 and 1840
include New York and Massachusetts, each of which received four
more than it deserved, Pennsylvania, which received three more, and
Virginia, which received two more. Among the smaller states
Delaware should have had four more than it had, Vermont three
more, New Jersey two more, Connecticut, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Missouri one more. Thus, during the first five decades of
apportionment, the populous states as a group got thirteen representatives
more than they were entitled to and the small states,
as a group, thirteen less. The efforts of Everett and Webster,
called forth by what looked like a serious injustice to Massachusetts,
led to the introduction ten years later of a better method,
but in so doing overturned a method by which in the long run
Massachusetts had profited as much as any state in the Union.
I conclude that the method of apportionment used between
1790 and 1830, under which all fractional remainders were rejected,
is incorrect and unconstitutional and that for two reasons:
first, it does not apportion in each state as near as may be to the
standard and, secondly, it regularly results in over-representing
the populous states.


### ---Economics-1916-0-07.txt---
If this conclusion is correct, but two methods of those which
have been tried remain to be examined, the method of major fractions
and the Vinton method. The arguments in favor of the
former and against the latter are of two classes: practical arguments
likely to gain the attention of members and committees of
Congress; and theoretical arguments appealing to statists and
mathematicians, but with little meaning for the general piublic.
During the prolonged controversy the solution reached by Congress
has at times appeared to theorists indefensible and the solutions
proposed by theorists have seemed to Congress unjust or incomprehensible.
In this controversy I believe that Congress has
usually been right in its instinctive judgment, but unable or indisposed
to furnish a convincing defense of its decision, and that the
theorists, while better equipped with arguments, have been defeniding
an untenable position.
The fundamental difference between the Vinton method and the
method of major fractions, as already explained, is that the former
starts from an assumed number of representatives and the
latter from an assumed ratio. So we are brought face to face with
the question, Which is the correct point of departure? Certain
practical considerations likely to affect the choice of Congress
between these methods will first be presented and later the more
theoretical arguments.
The method of an assumed ratio is implied in the Constitution,
which says, "The number of representatives shall not exceed one
for every thirty thousand." The purpose and result of this clause
were to limit the size of the House. If the Convention had had in
mind a method starting with a number of representatives, it would
have been more natural to make the clause read, "The number of
representatives shall not exceed x (e.g., 120 or 112)." The
phrasing of this limitation indicates that in thinking of apportionment
the members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787
instinctively began with a round number of persons to each representative.
Yet the form of the limitation was doubtless influenced
also by a desire to open the way for an increase in the size
of the House as the population of the country grew.
Until long after the fathers of the Constitution had passed off
the stage, this method was followed without hesitation or challenge.
When the change to the Vinton method, or method of a computed
ratio, was made, it was not from dissatisfaction with the method
of an assumed ratio! in the form it took after 1840. The main


### ---Economics-1916-0-08.txt---
motives for the change were a desire to end the rapid increase in
the size of the House of Representatives and a desire to withdraw
a vexatious and contentious question from the arena of public discussion.
The way was not then open, as it is now, for accomplishing
either purpose if the method of an assumed ratio was retained.
There are two serious difficulties with the results of the Vinton
method. It often results in a major fraction which does not entitle
the state to another representative; it sometimes results in two
consecutive tables in which the total size of the House differs by
one, but in the larger House the number of members from some
state is one less. The latter possibility first came prominently before
Congress in the tables p!repared in 1881, which showed that
if the House had 299 members Alabama was entitled to 8, but if
it had 300 members Alabama was entitled to only 7. Hence this
anomaly has come to be known at the "Alabama paradox." When
Congress has faced the rejection of one or more major fractions
under the Vinton method, it has assigned new members for those
fractions in defiance of the method's requirements. When it has
faced the Alabama paradox, it has avoided the difficulty by choosing
another table from the series. Thus neither of these anomalies
has occurred in any actual apportionment.
Under the system of an assumed ratio the number of representatives
in a state depends upon the initial ratio and the population
of the state, and not at all upon the population of any other state
or of the country. Thus, if serious errors had crept into the
enumeration of any state and been discovered after an apportionment
law had been passed, and if the method of an assumed ratio
had been used, the errors would have affected only the state in
which they occurred, but if the Vinton method had been used they
might have affected other states.
The only way in which the method of major fractions in the
form used in 1840 and revived in 1900 failed to meet the needs
of Congress was that it couild not furnish for the scrutiny of
members a series of tables, each apportioning one more representative
than its predecessor. The improvement introduced in
1910 resulted in removing that difficulty. To explain the innovation
we must return for a moment to events in the winter of
1900-1901. When the Census Office began the preparation of
apportionment tables from the figures of the Twelfth Census, it
decided to employ all the methods which had ever been used. For
this purpose two sets of tables were constructed, one following the


### ---Economics-1916-0-09.txt---
Vinton method, the other following the method of an assumed
ratio in its two forms, rejecting all fractions and rejecting only
minor fractions. In preparing the second set of tables the divisors
were successive multiples of 500. But a change of 500 in the
divisor did not regularly change the number of representatives by
one. Often no change, often a chanige of two, occasionally one
of three appeared, and in only one third of the cases did the results
of successive tables differ by one representative. Of the two
numbers of representatives most considered by Congress, 357 and
386, the former being the existing number and the latter the smallest
number under which no state would lose a representative,
neither occurred in the second series of tables, following the
method of major fractions. Nevertheless, in its decision Congress
showed indirectly but convincingly its preference for that method,
by selecting the Vinton table for 384 members and adding two
representatives for major fractions which, in the table, received no
such consideration. Evidently Congress needed a series of tables
meeting two requirements, each table apportioning one more representative
than its predecessor and every maj or fraction entitling
the state where it occurred to an additional representative;
had sought to meet these conditions by translating the results
of the Vinton method into those of the method of major fractions;
and to do so had broken with the principle on which the Vinton
method rests.

To understand how the needs of Congress were met in 1910 we
may start with a divisor of six million, which is contained in New
York State's population of nine million 1.5 times. Under the
method of major fractions a divisor of six million would assign
New York two members and every other state one. Let the divisor
be reduced unit by unit and each of the series of quotients will
slowly increase; when the divisor falls to about five million, the quotient
for Pennsylvania rises above 1.5 and that state becomes entitled
to a second representative. Let the divisor continue to fall;
at about three and three fourths million Illinois becomes entitled
to a second representative, and at three and two thirds million
New York becomes entitled to a third. By continuing this process
a House of any desired size may be apportioned under the method
of maj or fractions. To determine at what ratio the claim of
any state to any specified number of members matures and to
arrange the ratios for the several states, boundary ratios, as
I have ventured to call them, in one series following the order of


### ---Economics-1916-0-10.txt---
decreasing size is a simple problem of elementary mathematics.4
Then, by assuming as a ratio for division any number between two
consecutive boundary ratios, an apportionment table may be
constructed which will distribute one more representative than a
table constructed by the use of any ratio lying between the next
larger pair of boundary ratios. The tables which result lack no
characteristic mentioned as desirable and have no characteristic
mentioned as undesirable in the congressional debates of the last
eighty years. They were accepted in 1911 without any opposition
in committee, House, or Senate.
Here the case might be rested and a verdict awaited. But before
the bar of theory, or in the judgment of an Association like ours,
the verdict of Congress will not be conclusive. I turn, therefore,
to an examination of the theoretical advantages and disadvantages
of the two competing methods.
The Vinton method starts with an assumed number of representatives
and divides the constitutional population of the United
States by that number to determine the ratio. This step involves
a fundamental theoretical error. It overlooks the crucial fact that.
seats in the House of Representatives are of two classes, the 48,
one for each state, which are guaranteed by the Constitution and
are as completely beyond the control of Congress as the seats of
the Senators are, and the remainder, the number and distribution
of which are under congressional control. The two classes might
be named the apportionable and the unapportionable seats. The
fact that they are not individually distinguishable has apparently
been responsible for the failure to recognize their existence.
To get this theoretical requirement clearly in mind it may be
helpful to think of the seats in the House of Representatives as
numbered. The first 48 seats, one for each state, would be numbered
one to indicate that there is no basis for distinguishing between
them. The next seat, numbered 49, would be apportioned
to New York, number 50 to Pennsylvania, and so on.
If the first represeintative falling to Pennsylvania or New York is
as irrelevant or disturbing a factor for determining the ratio as
the single representative falling to Nevada or Wyoming, then
clearly the ratio cannot be found by dividing the constitutional
population of the United States by the number of representatives.
Nor have I been able to discover any other way by which the population


### ---Economics-1916-0-11.txt---
to one representative can be coinputed from the population
of each state and the size of the House.
The effect of this false start is felt in certain anomalies or paradoxes
to which the Vinton method gives rise.
A method theoretically sound should apply equally well to the
entire range of possibilities whether of interest to Congress or not.
The smallest possible House would consist of 49 members, 48 unapportionable
and one apportionable, the last obviously going to
New York. But if the population of the country is divided by 49
and the population of each state divided by the quotient, as the
Vinton method prescribes, New York and Pennsylvania would
receive four members apiece, even if no fractions were recognized,
and only 41 members would remain to be apportioned among the
other 46 states. Near the lower limit of possibilities the Vinton
method yields results which are obviously absurd.
A method theoretically sound should never produce the Alabama
paradox; under the Vinton method this paradox frequently occurs.
In 1901 the majority of the House Committee on the Census recommended
that there should be no increase in the size of the House,
its number at the time being 357. But in the set of tables we prepared
under the Vinton method Colorado received two representatives
with a House of 357 or 358 members and three not merely
for every higher number but also for every lower number down to
350, where the series of tables began. It was more than difficult,
it was impossible, to persuade the House that these results were
equitable, and its dissatisfaction with them had no little influence
upon its decision to reject the report of the majority and accept
that of the minority, substituting another number and table from
which the Alabama paradox was absent.
A method theoretically sound must be reversible. Thus, if the
House is to contain 4J5 members, that result might be approached
either by adding representatives seriatim from the minimum of
48 or by withdrawing them from some number much above 435. A
method proposed by Seaton and endorsed by Walker in 1882 was
tested by Congress far enough to show that it uniformly favored
the populous states and was incontinently rejected on that ground.
But if the same method had been reversed and the result approached
by successive subtractions rather than successive additions,
the outcome would have been just as definitely favorable to
the small states.

A method theoretically sound should hold the balance true between


### ---Economics-1916-0-12.txt---
the large and the small ;states. That the Vinton method
has a tendency, slight but persistent, to over-represent the large
states is demonstrable. The tendency may be illustrated by the
difference between the results of the two methods applied to 357
members. The Vinton method of 1900 gave Colorado and Florida
each 2 representatives, while the method of major fractions gave
them 3; the Vinton method gave Michigan 12 and Texas 15,
while the method of major fractions gave Michigan 11 and Texas
14. Which is correct? The standard is the assumed or computed
ratio, the two differing slightly but each indicating 48 representatives
to 10,000,000 people. If each of the small states received
3 seats, their ratio would be 56 to 10,000,000, an excess of 8;
if each received 2, their ratio would be 38 to 10,000,000, a
shortage of 10. Obviously the result giving each of them 3,
reached by the method of major fractions, is "as near as may be."
Obviously, too, the Vinton method results in under-representing
the small states.

For the populous states the outcome depends upon whether the
assumed or the computed ratio is made the standard. If the assumed
ratio is accepted, then to apportion the smaller numbers to
the populous states gives to those states ratios nearer the standard,
but if the computed ratio is accepted, there is a very slight balance
in favor of the larger numbers. Even if the computed ratio is used,
however, the net balance tips in favor of assigning the two seats in
question to the smaller states. The result is confirmed by examining
the figures for each state separately. Our analysis of this
examiple, then, shows that the Vinton method unjustly, and therefore
unconstitutionally, under-represents the small states and
over-represents the large ones. These results might be confirmed,
if there were time, by making a similar examination of the apportionment
of 386 seats in 1900 under the two methods. It would
show also that the apportionment of 386 seats by the method of
major fractions gives exactly the results which Congress secured
illegitimately, as we then believed, by starting with the Vinton table
for 384 and adding two for disregarded major fractions. This is
an indication that the instinctive judgment of Congress guided
them to the right goal although they started on a wrong road.
A method theoretically sound should establish the balancing
point between two consecutive numbers of seats, or the size of
the fraction entitling the state to another seat, at the middle
point or arithmetic mean and not at the geometric mean. This


### ---Economics-1916-0-13.txt---
is a necessary corollary of the preceding position, but needs especial
mention, because the use of the geometric mean has recently
been advocated. To use it, however, not merely would run counter
to the unvarying conviction of Congress that every major fraction
gives a valid claim to another seat, it would also result in
defeating the main object of the Constitution, which is to hold the
scales even between the small and the large states. For the use of
the geometric mean inevitably favors the small state. If it were
necessary to favor either group, the large states might be entitled
to more consideration in the IHouse, because the small states are
favored in the Senate. But, fortunately, there is no need to favor
either.

As a question of pure mathematical theory, apart from all
consideration of motive and from all practical arguments about
the judgment of Congress, I find no unanimity of expert opinion in
favor of the geometric mean. I have laid the problem before two
meetings of the Mathematical Club at Cornell University, and,
although no vote was taken, I inferred from the discussion that
there was a preponderance of opinion in favor of the arithmetic
mean. Thus the theoretical arguments of statists and mathematicians
point to the same conclusion to which Congress had already
been brought by other considerations and establish my thesis, that
the method of major fractions is the correct and constitutional
miethod of apportionment.
The House of Representatives is now more than six times its
size before the first census and four times its size immediately after
that. Within the half century since the only law passed with a
design to check its growth was last put in force, it has increased by
more than four fifths. While it has been thus expanding, no similar
change, I believe, has occurred in any other representative
assembly in this or any other country, with perhaps the exception
of the lower House in Austria, where the conditions are unique.
If its present rate of growth should continue for another century,
the House would include about 1,400 members. Such an
expansion is unlikely and perhaps in the interest of efficiency the
increase ought soon to slacken or to stop. From this point of
view the change made in 1911 gains new importance. It is now
possible for Congress to prescribe, in advance of an approaching
census, how many members the House shall contain, to ask the
Secretary of Commerce to prepare a table apportioning just that


### ---Economics-1916-0-14.txt---
number in accordance with the method of major fractions, and to
report the result to Congress or to announce it by executive proclaination.
The experiment which was tried in 1850 and 1860 and
which then failed, partly because of inherent defects of method
which have since been overcome, and partly because of problems,
no longer important, which arose out of the rapid admission of new
states and the absence of many members during the Civil War, can
now be repeated with more chance of success. As the House is
larger by four fifths than it was in 1856 and rapidly growing,
the arguments against further increase are stronger.
With a firm grasp of the elements of the problem and a century
of experience revealing what Congress regards as the essentials of
a sound method, the chance of meeting the conditions are better.
Ere long the pressure of opinion within or without the halls of
Congress is likely to result in a renewal of the effort to fix the size
of the House unalterably. If that effort is made, the removal of
the teclnical difficulties to which your attention has been called
this evening will have smoothed the path toward success and have
made it more likelv that when the change is again introduced it
will be permanent.

least appreciated passages in The W ealth of Nations. Apropos
of systems of land tenure the passage reads: "When land, like
movables, is considered as the means oonly of subsistence and enjoyment,
the natural law of succession divides it, like them, among
all the children of the family; of all of wlhom the subsistence and
enjoyment may be supposed to be equally dear to the father....
But wlhen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence
merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it
should descend undivided to one."1
IJere was a clear recognition of one of the most important principles
of national policy. When a nation is thinking primarily of
its own growth, prosperity, and power, of its ability to meet the
conditions of life as a nation, its institutions and its policies may
be very different from what -they would be if it were thinking
primarily of the consumers' satisfactions or of the enjoyment
which it might afford to its individual citizens. It may be added
that when its individual citizens themselves are thinking primarily
of the prosperity, power, and greatness of the nation they will
frame institutions and carry out policies very different from those
which they will frame and carry out if they are thinking primarily
of their own satisfaction as consumers, or of their own subsistence
or enjoyment. AMoreover, if economists, however completely they
may be divorced from sentimenlt, are thinking in terms primarily
of national prosperity, power, and greatness, their conclusions on
many important questions will be very different from wlhat they
would be if they were thinking primarily of consumers' satisfactions,
of subsistence, or of enjoyment. The economics of consumers'
happiness is one thing; the economics of national power tind
greatness is another thing.
Adam Smith's remarks on primogeniture may or ma y not be a
case in point. We may or may not agree that primogeniture does
work better in the process of nation-building and expansion thilan
equal subdivision. As was remarked long ago, it was at least a


### ---Economics-1917-0-02.txt---
guarantee that there would be only one drone in the same family.
It at least made it necessary that the younger sons go out into
the world and shift for themselves. They were not encouraged to
hang around home waiting for the old folk to die in order that
they might get a share of the estate. They had to go where there
was land and build estates of their own, if they wanted them. This
may have had something to do with the expansion of the English
race and of the British Empire. On the other hand, in those old
countries where the Code Napoleon had been in force there has
been little expansion. Relatively speaking, there has been a decline
in power both economic and military.
And yet, to anyone who thinks mainly in termis of consumers'
satisfactions, of fair play and equal rights in matters of enjoyment,
primogeniture seems a monstrous iniquity, and the equal
subdivision of land among all heirs is the only system which is
even tolerable. Of course there may be those who realize that it
is better for the individual to belong to a prosperous, powerful,
and expanding nation than to an unprosperous, weak, and contracting
nation. This consideration might lead them to surrender
niany consumers' satisfactions in the immediate present in the
interest of nation-building, hoping that they, their children or
their childrens' children may gain enough consumers' satisfactions
in the future to compensate for the sacrifices of the present. This
would bring them very close to those who think primarily in terms
of nation-building, if it did not identify them absloutely. They
might, even though they themselves were younger sons, favor
primogeniture if they were convinced that it pronioted the prosperity,
power, and expansion of the nation, hoping that their
children and their childrens' children would gain enough through
citizenship in such a country to compensate for the loss to themselves.


This, however, is not intended as a defense of primogeniture.
I use this illustration partly because it was dignified by the great
Adam Smith, and partly because it is, in itself, a good illustration
of the principle which I am trying to make clear. Another illustration,
less realistic and less disputable, may be manufactured
for the occasion. If, instead of the father's landed estate, we
were to consider the father's sword as the object which passes by
inheritance, the point may be made clear. If, with the inheritance
of the father's sword, there was also inherited the obligation to
use it for the defense or the building of the nation, it could scarcely


### ---Economics-1917-0-03.txt---
be considered as depriving the other sons of their rights if the
sword went intact to one, instead of being divided up. That
would be so obviously sensible that no one would be likely to champion
the rights of the disinherited sons. But if, instead of a
weapon or a tool to be used in nation-building, the sword were
thouglht of as an object of pleasure, a consumer's good, the case
would be different. They who think in terms of consumers' satisfactions
are uniformly rather strenuous in their insistence upon
their full share. The same rule wlhich seems so obviously sensible
from the other point of view becomes obviously and wickedly unfair
and stupid from the new point of view. The whole difference
is in the point of view.
There is another illustration equally clear and to the point, and
also dignified by an eminent and highly respected authority. It
is found in the story of a certain ruler who entrusted sundry pieces
of money to his servants, to one five, to another two, and to another
one. I-Ie who had received one piece of money did not use
it but hid it away. When the ruler returned lie ordered that this
one piece of money be taken away from the man who had not
used it, anid that it be given to the one who had used his five so
prodluctively as to gain another five. Now, I venture to say that
no one wlho thinks of pieces of money as sources of subsistence or
enjoyment ever understood this story or ever will so long as the
wvorld stands. But one who thinks of pieces of monley as tools to
be use(d in nation-building, finds the story so obviously sensible
as almost to preclude the possibility of discussion. Such a person
can see no reason for inventing the absurd theory that pieces of
money did not mean what they obviously did mean, but spiritual
qualities instead. lHe would know that it is a waste of good tools
to h-ave them hidden away, and that in the interest of society or
of the nation they ought to be taken away from the one who thus
wastes them and given to the one who shows his capacity to use
them productively. However, to one who thinks only or primarily
in terms of consumers' satisfactions, and to whom pieces of money
are merely sources of consumers' satisfaction, it would seem monstrously
unjust to take away from the poor man the one source
of satisfaction which he possessed and give it over to the rich man
who had ten already. The same rule, again, looks very different
from the two points of view. It is the point of view that makes
the difference.

If one were permitted to step outside the field of economics in
the narrower sense, and m ake an observation- or two in the field


### ---Economics-1917-0-04.txt---
of economics in the broader sense, now temporarily cultivated by
the moralist, one might remark that the concentration of attention
upon subsistence and enjoyment rather than upon nationbuilding,
leads to an exaggerated insistence upon the rights of the
individual, whereas the concentration of attention upon nationbuilding
leads to a strong emphasis upon the obligations of the
individual. Therefore, there are two distinct types of leadership.
One type tells the people a great deal about their rights, their
wrongs, and their grievances, and very little about their obligaLions,
except their obligations to -themselves. The other type tells
them very little about their rights, their wrongs, and their grievances,
but a great deal about their obligations. The first type is
a logical product of the habit of mind which lays enmphasis upon
the subsistence and enjoyment of the individual; the other of the
habit of mind which lays emphasis upon the importance of building
a strong, durable, and expanding nation.
The fact that a chlange in the point of view makes such a vast
difference in the way the same thing looks to us will also explain
the clhange which frequently comes over a man when he has,
through popular lecadership, come into a position of power and
responsibility. It has often been noticed that a man wlho has
achieved leadership through demagogic appeals to the masses becomes
a different minan when put into high public position. If he
does not, he does not last long, being repudiated even by the followers
who put him in. As a champion of those who think in
terms of their own subsisteiice and enjoyment, he was one kind of
man and things re-ally looked to hirn in a certain way. Jn high
national oftice he is compelled to think in terms of the nation as a
whole. If he does not, he is such an obvious misfit that even the
sense of humor of the masses can not tolerate him. If he does,
many things which formerly looked black now look white and many
which looked white now look black. It is very easy for the conservative,
on the one hand, to say that responsibility hlas sobered
him. He has not necessarily grown more sober; frequently he is
less so. He is usually even more of a visionary, the difference being
that he has got a larger vision. It is equally easy, on the
other hand, for those who have not yet achieved high office to say
that he has sold out to the interests. Generally he is less under
the domination of interests than he was before. The simple fact
is that he is forced to see things from a national point of view
rather than from a particularistic point of view; and the sheer


### ---Economics-1917-0-05.txt---
logic of the situation forces different views and a different attitude
upon him.

The change in the point of view produces some of its widest
divergences of opinion on the question of government regulation
and control. When we think primarily in terms of our own satisfactions
we are rather intolerant of government regulation when
it affects us directly. We may be very tolerant of, or favorable
toward, government regulation of other people; but as for ourselves,
we want none of it. We are all consumers, therefore regulation
of consumption is abhorent. The regulation or control of
some particular line of business is a different matter, especially if
it is not our business. Yet habits of consumption are quite as
important to the welfare of the nation, considered as a nation, as
methods of business. It is generally believed that nations have
deteriorated quite as frequently and quite as rapidly because
of their bad habits of consumption as because of the bad methods
of any or of all classes of business men. When one takes the
national point of view, that is a consideration of the verv greatest
importance. Those academic distinctions between regulation of
consumption and regulation of production seem trivial in comparison.
As a matter of observed fact, the people who think in
terms of nationality are just as prone to legislate on matters of
consumption as on matters of business. The government regulation,
or prohibition, of the consumptioni of alcohol, is quite the
most popular and democratic movement in this country today,
particularly among those who have been here long enough to develop
a sense of nationality. Again, as a matter of observed fact,
whenever a nation is, in the vernacular, "up against the real
thing," when its very existence as a nation is at stake, and when
it is forced to think in terms of nationality, it always finds it just
as necessary that its government should regulate consumption- as
that it should regulate production.
Another and even nmore striking examnple of this divergence of
opinion is found in our attitude toward control or regulation of
speech. I inake my living by talking, as do a fair percentage of
the active members of this Association. We are therefore unable,
most of us, to see any reason why the government should regulate
our business. We are pretty strong for freedom of speech andl
freedom of the press and all other euphemisms for a laissez-faire
policy with respect to the business of talking. It also happens,
curiously enough, that they whose business is talking are the
strongest advocates of the abandonment of the laissez-faire policy


### ---Economics-1917-0-06.txt---
-with respect to business--that is, other kinds of business. For
much the same reason, they whose business consists in doing rather
than in talking are too frequently impatient of loose talk and disposed
toward its control. It would be a profitable exercise for all
of us to ponder a little more upon the ancient remark about those
who were more anxious to pluck motes from their brothers' eyes
than beams from their own. That would do us more good than
to spend our time inventing absurd reasons why the government
should regulate other people's business and pursue a laissez-faire
policy with respect to our own.
There can scarcely be any doubt that bad talk may do quite as
much harm to the nation as bad business. As many and as direful
calamities have come upon the world through bad talk, false
teaching, pernicious opinions, as through bad business methods.
He who teaches falsehood probably harms the people more than
he who steals a million dollars, though it will appear otherwise to
those who think that truth is unimportant and money all important.
The only question is, Can we trust government officials with
the delicate task of deciding what is good and what is bad talk,
and of suppressing the bad? Well, any government official who
thinks that he is wise enough to regulate industry is not likely to
be withheld by his own modesty from undertaking the regulation
of speech. Again, as a matter of observed fact, no government
official does hesitate to exercise censorship so far as his authority
extends. Over the members of his own staff, which is as far as
his power extends, he does exercise control of speech. Even the
least free and most narrowly sectarian college in this country allows
more freedom to its staff than the most liberal department of
this freest of all governments. The head of a department who
is at all ingenuous will frankly acknowledge this, and justify it
by the perfectly sound reason that any department which is
charged with important regulatory powers must control the utterances
of its staff. I mention these things neither to justify nor
to condemn, but merely to show that one kind of regulation is
very likely to lead to another.
Again, as a matter of observed fact, whenever any nation
"comes up against the real thing," when circumstances compel it
to think in terms of its own existence as a nation, it finds it necessary,
through its government, to control both speech and industry-
the one quite as rigorously as the other. Again, if you
will name the country which in time of peace most thoroughly


### ---Economics-1917-0-07.txt---
regulates business and industry, you will name also the country
which most rigorously regulates speech.
These may be mere coincidences, but they are so numerous as
to create a presumption that the nation that definitely abandons
a laissez-faire policy with respect to one branch of human activity
is not likely to preserve it with respect to all others. Talkers may,
of course, easily invent reasons for placing the business of talking
in a different category from other businesses. I could state a
dozen such reasons myself, and an equal number to the contrary.
But the practical statesman and man of affairs, whatever he may
have said in a political campaign, is singularly indifferent to these
theoretical distinctions when he faces a real situation.
Please do not understand this as an argument for a laissez-faire
policy with respect to production, consumption, or speech. It is
as much against as for such a policy. The important point is
that whatever policy is pursued with respect to one is likely also
to be pursued with respect to the others. We are already beginning
to hear about the changed attitude of governments toward
industry brought about by the war in Europe. Some are speculating
as to the results of this changed attitude after the war is
over. Let us not close our eyes to the fact that the change in
the attitude of those governments toward consumption, toward
speech, and toward everything else which affects the national wellbeing
is quite as great and quite as striking as the change in their
attitude toward industry. They have founld that vicious habits
of consumption and hostile expressions of opinion are quite as
dangerous to the well-being of the nation as bad business methods.
When we begin to think in terms of nationality we shall all discover
the same thing.

The statement that one function of government is to protect
the weak against the strong is another product of the particularist
point of view. Since most of us are weak rather than strong,
we doubtless feel that we should get more individual advantage
from a government which followed that rule than from one which
did not. Even those who occupy a middle position between the
weak and the strong feel that they have more to fear from the
strong than from the weak; therefore they would be inclined, if
they sought their own advantage, to cast in their lot with the
weak. But if we are thinking not primarily how much profit we
of this generation can get from the government, but how the nation
may grow strong and endure, it would seem rather absurd,
would it not, to protect the weak against the strong? To protect


### ---Economics-1917-0-08.txt---
weakness against strength is to favor weakness and bid it multiply
and replenish the nation. That is one way of building a weak
natioll. It would obviously be better to protect strength against
weakness. As a matter of fact, that comes more nearly being
the policy of any country worth living in than the opposite.
Criminals are weak rather than strong. Somewhere between thirty
and fifty per cenL of them are feeble minded. It is found economical
to protect strength against that kind of weakness at least.
However, the aim of the niation-builder should be neither to protect
weakness against strength, nor primiiarily to protect strength
against weakness. The obvious thing to do is to protect production
against predation, usefulness against harmfulness, virtue
against vice. Whether the predacious act is performed by a
strong or a weak individual does not matter. It must be repressed
in either case. Whether the productive act be performed by a
weak or a strong individual does not matter; it must be protected
in eitlher case. Only thus can the nation grow strong, prosperous,
and fit to survive in the stern rivalry, economic or military,
among national groups.
One of the widest of these divergences of economic opinion, depending
upon the point of approach, is found in the answers to
the question as to how wealth ought to be distributed. From the
point of view of those who are interested primarily in consumers'
satisfactions, especially in the satisfactions of those consumers
who are now living and possessed of voices with which to clamor
for their share, there is much to be said in favor of some approach
to equality of possessions. The weak producers probably have on
the aNverage as muclh capacity for consumers' enjoyment as the
stronig producers. Certainly no very satisfactory argument to the
contrary has yet been presented. If the maximum of consumors'
satisfaction is the object to be sought, the weight of the argumeiit
is in favor of somne approach to equality. It is demonstrated
that among people with equal capacity for enjoyment equality of
consumption yields the maximum satisfaction. It is true that
some concession would have to be made in favor of the strong
producer provided it were found that he would not put forth his
maximum effort unless he received special rewards. Unless the
strong producers did put forth their best efforts at production,
there would be fewer consumers' goods and consequently less consumers'
satisfactions. It would therefore be necessary to allow
the strong producers just enough in the way of special rewards


### ---Economics-1917-0-09.txt---
to iinduce them to use their powers. Aside from such considerations,
the weight of the argument is in favor of some form of
comnmnunism.

From the point of view, however, of those who are primarily
interested in nation-building, the weight of the arguinent is in
favor of distributing wealth in proportion to productive power,
regardless of ability to consume joyfully. In the first place,
they who have shown the ability to accumulate capital by consurning
less than their income are to be considered better guardianis
of that accumulation than they who have not shown such
capacity or willingness. If it were turned over to those who have
been in the habit of consuming all they had, there would be a
strong probability that they would consume it and not conserve it.
In the long run, it is pretty certain that the nation whiclh accumulates
capital most rapidly is the nation which grows most rapidly
in property and power. It is a rather noticeable fact that even
laborers tend to leave those countries where capital does not accumulate
and seek those countries where it does accumulate. So
likewise do scholars, writers, and talkers.
Again, to invest capital is to direct the prodtuctive power of the
community. They who direct that productive power wisely, that
is, they who invest in such a way as to make it yield a large product,
are economizing the productive power of the community. On
the other hand, they who misdirect that power, who invest unwisely,
who direct productive power in channels where it is not
needed-in such a way as to produce less than is used up in the
process-are wasting the productive power of the community. It
is much better for the nation that the accumulations of capital
be invested by those who can do it wisely and productively than
that these accumulations should be invested by wasters, that is,
by those who invest them where capital is not needed or in ways
which use up more than is produced. In the long run, it is safe
to say that the country which manages to put its accumulated
capital under the control of the wisest investors is the country
which will grow most rapidly in prosperity and power. To such
a country even laborers will desire to migrate, and so also will
scholars, writers, and talkers. In other words, it is better for all
of us, in the long run, that accumulated capital should be distributed
in proportion to investing ability than that it should be
distributed in proportion to the power of graceful, elegant, or
even jovial consumption. "To each according to his ability to


### ---Economics-1917-0-10.txt---
use productively, to manage, or to invest," should be the slogan
rather than "to each according to his needs."
If I have succeeded in making it clear that it makes a difference
with our conclusions on many questions of economic theory
and policy whether we start from the national or from the particularist
point of view, my next purpose is to plead for the
national point of view. This point of view is especially needed at
the present time because so many weighty opinions are being expressed
against it. Tolstoi pronounced patriotism to be a vice.
One of the leading moralists of the country has said that nationalism
is one of his pet abominations, having in mind the situation in
Europe at the present time. It is doubtless wrong for a people
to make war under the stimulus of national arrogance; but his
philosophy would make it equally wrong for a nation to fight to
defend its territory or even its existence against the attacks of
national arrogance. It may be said, in behalf of his consistency,
that the moralist just quoted accepts the latter proposition along
with the former. National existence is not worth fighting for under
his theory. From that point of view, Horace Greely's advice
regarding the secession movement was profoundly wise, "Let the
erring sisters depart in peace." There were many in those days
to whom national unity did not seem worth fighting for, and who
opposed the war on that ground. From the particularist point of
view it would be a little difficult to state what class in the North
had a definite economnic interest in the question, or how the nonslave
owning majority in the South had anything at stake.
Neither the laboring classes nor the business and professional
classes were in visible danger of having their incomes reduced.
All classes then living could, so far as any one has ever been able
to show, have consumed as much had the country split up as if it
remained united. The only class that might have suffered economically
was the government officials. They would have ruled
over a smaller country, and the salaries might conceivably have
been smaller, though even this is by no means certain. To be sure,
there were certain large but vague questions regarding the distant
future which may have weighed heavily on the minds of men.
Had the country split then, it was difficult to see where the particularist
tendency would end. The possibility that at some distant
day their descendants would suffer from the weakness of a
divided country may have had its influence; but such considerations
do not have much weight except with those who have what


### ---Economics-1917-0-11.txt---
is called a national consciousness. There was barely enough of
this to save the day against the indifference of the particularists
of the North and the opposition of the secessionists of the South.
The little flame of national sentiment had to be nursed and coaxed
by the persuasive force and mnagnetic personality of the greatest
of all popular leaders.
A distinguished sentimentalist, who can scarcely be dignified by
the name of moralist, has recently said before a large body of
laboring men in New York that even in case of a military invasion
of this country the laboring men would have no interest at stake
and no motive for supporting a defensive war. Quoting the Communist
Manifesto, she exclaimed that the laboring men had "nothing
to lose but their chains." Anyone who believes that believes
that laboring men are swine, that they have no interest beyond
a full belly and a short working day,-that they have no souls.
I refuse to believe it.
If one begins the inquiry as to how incomes and dinner-pails
would be affected by foreign domination, why stop with the laboring
men? They certainly lhave as much to lose as any other class.
Suppose that we were to submit quietly to foreign occupancy, and
the taking over of the government at Washington by a foreign
power, who among us would suffer any diminution of income or of
consumers' satisfactions? It is unlikely that our business men
would suffer as a class. In fact, there is no foreign government
which is strong enough to attempt a conquest which does not treat
business men quite as well as our government, which does not protect
life and property and repress mob violence rather more effectively
than our government is in the habit of doing.
Again, so far as the economic self-interest of those now before
me is concerned, it is difficult to see how you as a class would be
economically injured if another government sent an army and took
possession of our capital and ran its machinery. In any country
which is strong enough to attempt such a thing, scholarship stands
higher, and scholars are better treated, than in this country. If
you have no interest beyond your own incomes and consumers'
satisfactions, why should any of you bestir yourselves to repel
an invasion? And yet, with this argument fully in mind, I venture
to say that at least ninety-nine out of a hundred, even of your
class, would bestir themselves and make considerable sacrifices to
prevent such a thing from happening. The hundredth, if there be
one, would be about as popular as a copperhead was in the North


### ---Economics-1917-0-12.txt---
at the end of the Civil War. The ninety and nine would be
tempted to classify him as a white-livered scoundrel. While the
idea might be correct, the nomenclature would not be strictly
scientific. It would be better to call him the kind of philosopher
to whom nationality is a pet abomination.
There is, however, one small class who alone would lose heavily
by a foreign conquest. This class is made up of sundry gentlemen
in Washington and various other capitals now holding jobs and
receiving salaries which, though not large, are as a rule larger
than those same gentlemen could earn elsewhere. They would
most certainly be turned adrift and their places filled by representatives
of the conquering power. If nobody cared except they
who had something to lose in the way of income, these gentlemen
would naturally be most vitally interested. They who think and
talk only in terms of full dinner-pails and easy hours would doubtless
say that these gentlemen were merely afraid of losing their
jobs.

But should the rest of us care? We should. We do not look
cynically upon those gentlemen merely as the holders of easy jobs
and the receivers of fat salaries, though their jobs and their incomes
do undoubtedly mean as much to them as ours do to us.
We look upon them rather as trustees of our national interests
and the agents for the carrying out of our national aspirations.
The sentiment of nationality is as real as hunger, thirst, or
family affection, and like them it supplies us with a motive which
impels us to a proper functioning. Indeed, there is a pretty close
parallelism between family sentiment and national sentiment as a
motive for functioning. To one who possesses neither it would
appear rather stupid to deprive one's self of consumers' satisfactions
merely to provide means for the support of a family. A
man whose interests do not extend beyond a full belly and a short
working day would see no reason why he should sacrifice these
interests merely in order that his species might survive. The
number of men who desert their families and the larger number
who have no families at all, are proof that there are considerable
numbers who reason that way. There may be some moral philosophers
among them to whom family sentiment is a pet abomination.
Why should not a sentimentalist of the same shallow type as the
one referred to above advise all such men not to sacrifice anything
for such an absurd sentiment as family affection, telling them that
they have "nothing to lose but their chains."


### ---Economics-1917-0-13.txt---
However, it would probably not be'very difficult to convince the
average audience that family affection really has a place in the
economy of nature. It seems to supply a motive which leads men
to do what would, without it, be contrary to their individual or
particular interests, in favor of the interest of the species. The
future members of our race have a vital interest in what we do,
but they have no voice to persuade us, or bribe to offer us. They
have, nevertheless, an advocate with us, to appeal powerfully to
our wills to persuade us to do what is necessary for their salvation.
That persuasive advocate is domesticity.
It seems to have been pretty well demonstrated that the human
race succeeds better when it hunts in packs or works in groups
than when it hunts or works as individuals. In the long run, the
well-being of the species seems to depend about as definitely upon
the existence of some large group, variously called state or nation,
as upon the small group called the family. Without a sentiment
of nationality it would be about as difficult to preserve the larger
group as it would be to preserve the smaller group without a sentiment
of domesticity. They who lack national sentiment find it as
difficult to frame arguments in favor of sacrificing individual for
national interests as they who lack family sentiment find it to
frame arguments in favor of sacrificing individual for family interests.
In neither case do men find themselves wise enough or virtuous
enough to safeguard the future interests of mankind. Lacking
these sentiments, they build only as well as they know; possessing
them, they build better than they know.
Even though we possess the family sentiment, few of us are wise
enough to plan as wisely for our descendants three generations in
the future as we do for ourselves. None of us is wise enough to
plan for those who are to live a hundred, or even ten, generations
hence. The feebleness and shortsightedness of the intellect is here
supplemented by the generous sentiment of nationality. It is
through this sentiment that we are led, "as by an invisible hand,"
to safeguard the interests of that vast majority which never votes
for the excellent reason that it is not born yet. Without this
sentiment we should each of us join in the query, What has posterity
ever done for me that I should do anything for posterity?
Self-interest, even when widened so as to include one's own immediate
flesh and blood, will not lead us to safeguard the interests
of that vast unborn majority. The sentiment of nationality,
the love of country, pride in its growth and prosperity, the desire


### ---Economics-1917-0-14.txt---
to see it grow and hold an honorable place among the nations of
the earth, these are the salvation of those voiceless generations
whose prosperity and happiness for centuries to come depend upon
what we do here and now.
It must be admitted, however, that there are perversions of the
national sentiment as there are perversions of hunger, thirst, and
sex. But it ought not to be difficult to distinguish between the
perversion of an instinct and the instinct itself. "Does not war
proceed from national sentiment?" is sometimes asked by the men
and women who have forgotten, if they ever knew, that wars were
more frequent and more continuous before such a thing as nationality
or national sentiment existed than they are now. It is probably
true, however, that when it does come, a war between highly
organized and powerful nations is more terrific than one between
weak and disorganized hordes with little national consciousness.
If a powerful national sentiment is a factor in building a powerful
and prosperous nation, and saich a nation is therefore capable of
carrying on a terrific war, there may then be said to be a connection
between a strong national sentiment and the terrific character
of a modern war. But shall we surrender the power and prosperity
which come from a compact and well organized national
life, and grow weak and unprosperous, merely in order that we
may not be able to wage war on such a scale and with such destructiveness
as that which the world is now witnessing? Before
a war can be carried on on a vast scale there must be vast power
and resources, both in men and the products of the mind. Before
it can be very destructive there must be something to destroy as
well as something to be used in destruction. To propose to divest
humanity of all national sentiment in order to save it from the
havoc of war is about as reasonable as to divest it of appetite in
order to save it from the perversions of appetite.
"Where there is no vision, the people perish." This is said to
be a bad translation. "Where there is no vision the people become
disorganized, or throw off restraint," is said to be more accurate,
but it may mean much the same thing. If they become
disorganized, if they throw off restraint, if they will not subject
themselves to discipline, they will grow weak. In the eternal process
of trial and rejection, of survival and extinction, by which
every step in progress thus far in this unfinished world has come
about, weakness means death. This applies not to plant and
animal forms alone, but to social institutions, moral systems,


### ---Economics-1917-0-15.txt---
forms of government, tribes and nations of men as well. Can
democracy discipline itself and fit itself to meet this test? If not,
democracy can no more survive than could any of the other thousand
and one organisms that have become extinct through their
inability to meet the conditions. The world has always been ruled
by the disciplined nations, and unless there is a complete reversal
of the process, it will be ruled by them to the end of time. If
democrats can discipline themselves as well as rulers can discipline
their subjects, then democracy may survive; otherwise not.
There is no motive known to any student which will compel a
whole democracy to discipline itself, except a powerful national
sentiment. The individuals must all, with one accord, care and
care intensely for the same thing. This and this alone will enable
each person to subject his interests to the good of the whole, and
the lesser interest of the present to the larger interest of the
future. Only they to whom Webster's words on Union and Liberty
meant something for which they cared considerably were prepared
to hazard their lives for that something. Only they who, like
Milton, see in their minds "a great and puissant nation," have
the vision which keeps men from becoming demoralized, from
throwing off restraint, from becoming undisciplined. Without
this endurance of restraint-without this self-discipline-the people
perish.

The doctrine of laissez faire had a practical and a theoretical
origin. On the practical side was the inefficiency and the autocracy
of government. On the theoretical side, the doctrine of the
Law of Nature and the natural rights of the individual.
It needed no proof in the eighteenth century that government
was incompetent and despotic. The fact stood out in every attempt
of the middle classes to take advantage of the discovery
of America, of the new expansion of markets, and the new inventions
of machinery.

Great Britain, by the accident of her island more than the
theory of her philosophers, proved that, in order to conquer and
settle the New World, to expand her markets, to invent and use
machinery, government does most when it does least. The westward
ho! of Britain's free-booters and discoverers, the eastern
and westward conquests of the Plymouth, the London, the East
India, and other companies of "adventurers"-in short, the private
initiative and private capital of her ungoverned subjectsgave
to England a navy and an empire. Then, when her inventors
and manufacturers escaped from the governmental regulation of
the town gilds to the unregulated open country of Manchester
and Birmingham, it was private initiative and private capital that
gave to England her wealth and a world market.
Finally Adam Smith, borrowing from France the philosophy
of a benevolent law of nature, the rule of Universal Reason, justified
in theory what England had already demonstrated in practice.
And so England, by her happy experiment, got the start of
the rest of Europe by one or two hundred years, but tied herself
to a theory of laissez fatre which assumed that the conditions
would always hold the same. The experiment and its theory have
brought her, indeed, the wealth of nations, but the theory put her
asleep while another experiment and another theory were shaping
themselves to snatch her wealth and perpetuate her sleep.
The theory of the beneficent Law of Nature started from the
hypothesis of both the incompetency and the autocracy of government.


### ---Economics-1918-0-02.txt---
But now we see, not that the hypothesis was false, but
that it was provisional. The most autocratic government remaining
over from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries of Europe
is the most efficient.
The old theory started, too, with the assumption that power
and liberty are two mutually exclusive and hostile principles in
the life of a nation. Power is the power of despotic government,
the force that gives sanction to the personal decrees of a sovereign-
in short, power is arbitrary coercion. But liberty is
freedom from coercion. It is escape from the power of the state
and refuge in the benevolence of nature. So, liberty is conformity
to the laws of nature; power is violation of nature's law.
But the new theory of Germany starts with the hypothesis that
the power of the state is not a violation, but the ripe fruit and
the evolutionary outcome of the laws of nature. Power is the
rule, not of reason, but of will; and nature is not reason, as it
was to the philosophers of the eighteenth century, but, to the
philosophers of the twentieth century, nature is will, and the highest
will on earth is the will of the state. There are, therefore, no
natural rights of individuals superior to the will of the state, and
consequently no corresponding duties of individuals, no morals,
no ethics, no sanctity of private contracts nor of international
treaties-nothing, indeed, that looks for its validity towards any
so-called law of nature, if that conflicts with the highest law of
nature, which resides in the will of the state.
But this culmination of the will of nature in the will of the
state, with its absorption of private will into political will, requires
something to take the place of liberty. Although liberty
finds no support in a fictitious natural law or natural rights, yet
still the greatest thing that contributes to the power of the state
is this very private initiative, private inventiveness, the energy
of the individual. Sweep away his lnatural rights by substituting
the will of the state for the reason of nature, and there must be
substituted, not indeed that arbitrary coercion which provoked
laissez faire, but such a scientific use of the power of the state,
based on accurate knowledge of hurnan nature, as will lead the
individual to exert himself to the utmost. Abolish liberty, but
substitute inducement. Offer rewards, promotions, distinctions,
honors, bonuses, subsidies, establish technical schools and an educational
system that will oversupply the market for brains.
Obtain the maximnum output of human eneigy for the sake of the


### ---Economics-1918-0-03.txt---
state, with the minimum expenditure from the resources of the
state. Govern the people, not by liberty, but by psychology; not
by reason, but by scientific management; not by laws of nature,
but by inducements to human nature.
So we today are seeing the clash for control of the world between
these two great experiments and their two appropriate
theories. On the one side is laissez faire, keep hands off, the doctrine
that weakens the power of the state to enhance the liberty
of the individual. On the other the doctrine of power that
strengthens the state through scientific and economical management
of individuals.

Whatever the outcome, today is a day of reconstruction-reconstruction
of theory and reorganization of practice.
The underlying theory of all the political and social sciences
is the theory of value. I need not say that economic theory rests
upon the laissez-faire philosophy of Adam Smith and the eighteenth
century. It rests upon the isolated and ungoverned individual
seeking the highest net income for himself. Sociologists,
in recent years, have done much towards devising a social theory
of value, and economists have profited thereby. But there is
needed also a political or juristic theory of value.
The latter has already been rising up out of our American
democracy and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United
States. In the decisions establishing the power of the state to
make special assessments on account of the value of special benefits;
then in the so-called unit rule of taxation on the total value
of public utility property; then in the quite opposite valuation
of public utilities for purposes of rate regulation; in these and
other decisions peculiar to our American system the Supreme
Court of the United States goes back to a theory of value as a
contest of power between individuals and classes in the community.
A court of law, unlike the economist, begins its theory of value
from the standpoint of two opposing litigants, representing two
opposing classes, with opposing rights and duties, instead of an
isolated individual exploiting niature wlhich is the state without
rights or duties. Out of these contests of legislatures with courts,
and of litigants with litigants, over value as power has come, not
a laissez-faire theory of value resting oni the psychology of business
in a state of nature, but a juristic or political theory of value,
resting on the struggles of American democracy for economic
power and liberty through politics. It is a theory whose starting


### ---Economics-1918-0-04.txt---
points are the constitution, the bills of rights, the definitions of
private property, the sovereignty of the state, and which seeks
its standards of value through notions of equal opportunity,
equality of bargaining power, solidarity of interests, and public
utility.

Again, the American theory of laissez faire springs, not from
the autocracy of government, but from its inefficiency. There
was, in our early history, no effective a priori objection to the
state undertaking anything that the people wanted. But when
the experiments broke downi thlouglh bankrup-tcy the same people
wrote laissez faire into the constitutions.
On the other h-land, our tlheory of natural rights has not been
a theory of laissez faire. It appeared in our Declaration of Independence,
not in order to foreclose anything from governments
controlled by ourselves, but in order to justify our escape from
the autocratic governuient of England. Rather has our theory
of natural rights been a theory of the equal right of anybody to
get all he can out of the government. It did not stand in the
way of a high protective tariff, but rather helped along a logrolling
tariff.

So with ouir natural resources and public domain. The homestead
law and its many collateral timber, desert, and mining acts
were a conclusion from the natural right of anybody to get anything
that belonged to the government. I need only mention
the river and harbor and the public building appropriations.
They, like the tariff, logrolled the taxing power of -the state. And
even the public offices in federal and state governments came to
be the natural and equal right of any individual.
No, our theory of natural rights has not been a laissez-faire
theory of governmenit, but a pork-barrel theory. Not a let-alone
theory but a let's-grab theory. And it is embedded deep in our
every relation to the government, while the river and harbor bills
are its picturesque outcropping.
And this theory was roughly suited to the nineteenth century
of America. It was the century of conquest of Indians and Mexico,
of expansion and occupation westward, of civil war that
centralized power. But, unlike the theory that the state is power
for the sake of more power, it is a theory that the state is power
for the sake of individuals. UTnlike the theory of laissez faire that
the state is a necessary evil, it is a theory that the state is the
political method by which individuals unite to use the sovereign
power for their own purposes.


### ---Economics-1918-0-05.txt---
The weakness of the theory is its i;maturity and its inefficiency.
The pork-barrel theory is not wholly false. It established for the
nilleteenth century the truth, as we see it in America, that the
state exists for the sake of its individuals.
But the theory is a half truth. Nature may endow the individual
with rights, but she does not seem to burden the same
individual with duties. The duties are imposed on other persons.
But if rights proceed, not from nature, but from the state, then the
very act that grants a right imposes an equivalent duty in contemplation
of it. This we now have begun to recognize. The
equivalent duty is not only on other persons to respect the right,
it is on the person who has the riglht to vindicate himself.
This is the missing half of the pork-barrel theory. It was not
missed particularly in the nineteenth century, when those who did
not have rights of property could move west and get them. It is
missed in the twentieth century when those who are short on rights
are compelled to make terms with those who have them. And it
is this other half of the doctrine that has already begun, in the
nineteenth cenitury, to force its way up and to offset both the
natural rights of the individual and the pork-barrrel theory of
the state.

At the very height of the victorious westward sweep of the doctrine
of natural rights, the Supreme Court of the United States,
in the "Granger" railroad cases, went to an extreme limit in
denying it, for, according to that decision, the property of individuals
affected by a public use rests, not on their natural rights,
but on their power to persuade the voters at the elections. Since
that time almost every class of property, in one direction or another,
has become affected by a public use and the election returns.
Along with these decisions have come those which established
the so-called unit rule of taxation. A public utility corporation
is no longer assessed merely on its physical property, such as
buildings, lands, and houses, but on the capitalized value of its
total earning power as a unit-on the market value of its stock
and bonds.

Likewise with the theory of assessment for special benefits.
This peculiarly American doctrine springs from the instinctive
practice of American democracy. When a local governmenta
city, town, or village-constructs a public improvement, say
a street or a highway, the cost of construction may be assessed,
not against all of the taxpayers, but against those whose property


### ---Economics-1918-0-06.txt---
is especially augmented in value by the improvement. The special
assessment, as pointed out by T. S. Adams, is a kind of excessprofits
tax. It is a tax on the unearned increment, and large
sums of money for public improvements are raised in this way.
In every case of a public improvement we see a contest, or at
least a contrast, between the special-benefit theory and the porkbarrel
theory. The state and federal governments are still in
the pork-barrel stage. Rivers, harbors, and public buildings are
paid for out of taxes upon the nation as a whole, instead of by
assessments on the local real estate owners who are benefited.
These three classes of decisions regarding the value of property
have changed the definition of property itself. Property is no
longer the eighteenth century notion of holding a physical thing
exclusively for one's own use, but property is value; value is power
over others; and the court protects not necessarily the unregulated
market value, but the reasonable value of property, against
confiscation by the voters.
The political and judicial contests of the future, as in the
recent past, turn on the power of the state and the power of
private property; and their issue is the kind and extent of state
control over the values of private property. It is this issue that
is forced upon us more acutely by the world war.
In the westward movement of our population during the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, the pioneers and settlers were
led on, not mainly by the expectation of daily earnings, but by the
expectation of future increments of land value. The pioneers
were speculators. The same principle underlies all business. The
so-called watered stock which promoters and financiers give to
themselves and sell to others in starting a business is their claim
to the speculative value, which they expect the business eventually
to make good. Without this speculative element, in one form
or another, private enterprise will not take hold of an investment.
But speculation acquired a new importance in the latter part
of the nineteenth century. During three-quarters of the century,
as has often been pointed out, there remained free resources to
the west, and private enterprise was busy in occupying these resources.
During the latter part of the century these resources
were occupied and investors turned back and bid against each
other for the resources already occupied.
So, in the early period, the increase in value of the occupied
resources was limited by the opportunity to go elsewhere, and


### ---Economics-1918-0-07.txt---
consequently the expected reward to speculation could not be
excessive. In the later period the increase in value of resources
comes to be limited only by the low rates of interest that investors
are willing to accept. The lower the rate of interest the higher
the price the investor is willing to pay for the property that
yields the interest. In the early period speculation served to
develop new resources. I'he nation could afford the high exceptional
rewards, for they added to the national wealth. In the
later period it served to force up the values of resources already
ownled, and in so far does not add to the national wealth, but to
the power of owners to extract a share from the national income.
Yet there remainied still another source of speculative profits.
It was the consolidations, under combinationis and trusts, of resources
already developed. 'the trust financing of later years
could afford to pay high prices for established plants and still
leave a speculative profit, by reason of their new economies and
their new power over prices.
But now this source of speculation is also closing. The former
low speculative values, with their expectation of high profits, are
swallowed up by high investment values satisfied with relatively
low rates of interest. Consequently, within the past decade or
two, it is towards Mexico, Canada, China, Central and South
America, Africa or Russia, where the speculative investment is
low, that American capital has begun to look for high profits and
future increases in the value of property. The frontier has moved
out of our own country and the speculative values of the future
are in the backward countries of the earth.
Here the government again is brought in. If these speculative
values are to be realized, it will be because they are protected by
the diplomacy and ultimately by the military power of the state.
If thus protected, then the stocks and bonds that represent the
low speculative values of these foreign holdings will be sold to
our own people at high investment values based on the lower rates
of interest which investors get at home. Thus the vested right
to military protection abroad will grow with what it feeds upon.
Surely, our government rightly hesitates before it ventures out
on this new frontier. It may be that our demand for the "open
door" will force us hereafter to join with Europe in the protection
of investments in backward countries. An enduring world peace
can scarcely be looked for without both the open door and military
protection for such investments. And this, of course, means opportunity


### ---Economics-1918-0-08.txt---
for American speculation to collect the savings, the
surplus capital of Americans, for investment abroad.
Yet our land differs from Europe. Europe is both overpopulated
and overinvested, compared with ourselves. Germany could
be crowded into one or two of our greater states. From the national
standpoint we need to keep American capital at home.
From the speculative standpoint it will not stay at home. We
may refuse to protect it abroad, with the idea of forcing it to
stay at home; but that will not suffice. It will then merely seek
the cover of that flag, or that alliance of flags, which comes out
victorious in the present war.
This, then, is the momentous issue into which our surplus capital
and our high investment values with their corresponding low
rates of profit have brought us. Wars in the past have been
fought over exports of products and annexations of territory.
These issues are, of course, present in this war, but, more important
for the future is the issue of investment in backward
countries, of lending our savings to foreigners-the export of
capital as well as the export of products.
Yet our country needs our surplus capital. We cannot prohibit
it from going abroad. We can only compete with the international
speculative financier who invites it to go abroad.
And this competition can be met only by the state in its several
divisions of local, state, and federal governments. Already the
federal government has begun to compete. The irrigation and
reclamation projects, the subsidies to industrial education-in
these cases the state is using its taxing power in such a way as
to divert the possible savings of the people away from the international
financier and into the development of our own resources.
The government has this advantage over the financier-it can
force savings to be diverted by means of the taxing power, and
it can induce them to come at lower rates of interest on its own
bonds or on the bonds that it guarantees. And with the high
values and consequently high initial investments now required it
is only this power to get capital by taxation or at low rates of
interest that can make possible, on a sufficiently large scale, these
internal improvements.
Not only a far-reaching system of rural credits, of land reclamation,
and of local highways, but also a huge extension of railways,
is a pressing need. It is estimated that the railways will
require, within the next ten years, over a billion dollars a year of


### ---Economics-1918-0-09.txt---
new capital. Private capi-tal will not invest at the low rates of
profit allowed under government regulation. Rather should we
say, private financiers will not undertake to collect the needed
capital from investors unless they are allowed the speculative
values of future unregulated profits.
I need not enlarge upon the reasons for which government hias
eliminated speculation in the railroad business. I-t was closely
connected with tlhe effort to do away with discriminations. Private
speculation does not go where service is needed the moLst, but
where the returns are highest. Consequently the private financier
seeks the business of the great corporation or the great city; and
this, instead of mainly developing the country, mainly adds to
the values already developed.
The next step was inevitable: that of limiting the profits as a
whole by regulating the entire schedule of rates. And it is this
that stands in the way of obtaining the one or more billions of
capital needed every year in order to catch up witlh the growth
of the country.

Our experience in this respect is not different from that of
otlher countries. It has been mainly the fact that privsate finanlciering
could not get the capital needed for the national necessities,
whether military or industrial, that has forced other
countries either to subsidize railways, or to guarantee tlheir stocks
and bonds, or to purchase them outright.
One or another of these methods we must look to as inevitable.
A general increase in freight rates offers no assurance either tlhat
the new capital will be obtained, or, if obtained, that it will be
used where it is needed for the development of the country.
The same is true also if the railroads are subsidized or if interest
on the new capital is guaranteed. The mnain objeet is to
take out of the hands of the speculative financier the power to
(decide where the new extensions shall be built, the new terminals
be provided, the new rolling stock be furnished. This is already
clone in some states in a negative way by giving to the state commissions
power to vcto issuess of stocks and bonds, or to prohibit
duplication of lines. Buit it is not done in the positive and necessary
way of ordering new lines to be built where the country most
needs them. Whether the state subsidizes or guarantees or owns
the railroads, it must be the government that decides positively
wlhere the money shall be spent.
Buit in all of these cases of proposed internal development, the


### ---Economics-1918-0-10.txt---
pork-barrel theory of government threatens governmental bankruptcy
by diverting the benefits of national taxation and low rates
of interest into further increased values of local real estate.
Already certain reclamation projects have pushed up the investment
values of land and burdened the actual settler with fixed
charges which drive him in turn to demand relief, not of the speculator
who has benefited, but of the government that has advanced
the capital. In these reclamation cases there was no theory of
value to guide the engineers who laid out the projects. Almost
the entire increase in value which the government added to the
property went to the speculative owners instead of to the actual
farmers. And now the government is asked to forego even its
low rate of interest, and perhaps the principal itself, so that the
farmer can make a living after having paid the speculator. The
alternative is bankruptcy for the farmer or more taxes for the
people.

Likewise with the subsidies to rural highways. In every state
we see the unseemly struggle between localities to get hold of this
state and federal taxing power which gives a special and permanent
benefit to local real estate. Had the special-benefit theory
been adopted, then the states and federal government would first
decide what highways are needed in the public interest and then
require the benefited property to refund the expense, to the extent
of the benefit.

More serious is the case of railways. The weightiest objection
to the government ownership of railways is the dreaded scramble
in Congress to get local extensions, terminals, and new lines
whether needed or not by the nation as a whole. The imagination
is stunned by the possibilities of logrolling and national bankruptcy
from this source, if the government owns the railways.
But with the doctrine of special benefits, namely, that the benefited
property of each locality and not the taxes of the nation should
be required to pay the expenses of permanent irnprovements, the
government might advance on a policy of public ownership without
fear that local private interests would logroll the general
public interest. Indeed, here again, as in the case of government
subsidies for rural credit, for reclamation and for highways, the
special-benefit theory is a specific against the fatty degeneracy of
the pork-barrel theory. The inducement to logroll for special
benefits is reduced if those who get the benefit are required to pay
for it.


### ---Economics-1918-0-11.txt---
The problem of getting new capital for economic reconstruction
after the war is the serious problem thrown upon us by the war.
Already the warring nations have begun to stagger under the
load of debt for military purposes. The burden of debt means
heavy taxes. New sources of revenue must be found. These
taxes may be levied in such a way as to burden industry and
handicap private enterprise, or in such a way as to place the
burden on various kinds of excess profits, unearned increments,
and special benefits. The latter tends to reduce the taxes on new
capital, going as far in some cases as to exempt it altogether
from taxation, and so to unburden industry and invigorate private
enterprise. This is the lesson taught by the American system
of special assessments on account of special benefits. Capital is
raised for public improvements, not by burdening the investor, but
by taxing an unearned increment.
But it is not only new sources for obtaining capital that the
war has forced us to seek; it is also a new way of telling where
it shall be invested when found. Here the war has also forced
the method upon our attention. It notifies us that the doctrinie
of laissez faire is dead. The nation that killed it now threatens
to build world empire on the others that did not know it was dead.
In whatever direction we look, even in our own country, we see
interested parties arranging its funeral. And it is dead just because
it cannot secure new capital to be invested where either
the nation or those directly interested want the investment to be
made. If it is the foreign export of products that we want, then
the nation must provide a merchant marine by means of taxes
or subsidies. If it is the open door for foreign investment and
export of capital to backward countries that we want, then the
nation must tax or bond itself for armies and navies to protect
those investments. And if it is the development of our own resources
that we want, by means of highways, railways, rural credit,
reclamation, or industrial education, then the nation again must
tax itself or bond itself or guarantee private bonds in order to
subsidize the needed improvement.
Laissez faire is dead, and the only question is, where shall the
state employ its taxing power and its borrowing power in order
both to get and to invest the new capital?
If the foregoing analysis of American theories of value, of
property, and of sovereignty, has significance, it lies in this: that
American democracy and its Supreme Court have already given


### ---Economics-1918-0-12.txt---
an answer, and the answer is a kind of specific against the very
evils of the pork-barrel that drove America into the lap of laissez
faire. The answer is that the new capital be raised by various
kinds of special benefit assessments on all kinds of property or
income that are specially benefited by the activities of local, state,
and federal governments; that taxes be reduced or discontinued
on those forms of industry that are not specially benefited and
that therefore must compete with the international financier for
new capital that can flow anywhere on the world market; and,
finally, that the state employ its borrowing power, backed by its
taxing power, to buy and operate those essential and basic industries,
whether higlhways, railways, mines, forests, or waterpowers,
upon which all industries depend for materials, for mechanical
power, and for markets.
These may rightly be said to be the lessons both of the war and
of American democracy.
I do not overlook the fact which originated and now supports
our laissez-faire theory, namely, the incompetency of government
to administer a public business. Just because our pork-barrel
theory encourages individuals and classes to logroll and get all
they can out of government without giving much in return, it
follows that they wish to see an inefficient government that cannot
protect itself against them. But when we realize that our liberty
and property depend upon a competent civil service and an expert
administration of government, then we make sacrifices and pay
attention in order to strengthen that administration. Thousands
of our successful business men, professional men, and labor leaders,
through their service on councils of defense and other public bodies,
are now learning both the vital importance of public business and
the reasons for its incompetency; and government officials are
learning that they cannot administer public business without the
assistance of these same representative private citizens.
Our inefficiency is a state of mind, a pork-barrel theory; a
laissez-faire philosophy. By reason of it we have built up great
private interests whose speculative profits render them hostile to
a strong and efficient government, except wlhere it helps them.
By a different state of mind we are already building up great
public interests that require and are beginning to get tlhe co6peration
of private interests.
But it is also objected that these are the teaclhings and devices,
not of American democracy, but of German auitocracy, whose


### ---Economics-1918-0-13.txt---
example we must avoid., Rather are they the processes by whichl
Germany is mastering the world. Germany is forcing us to become
a great military and naval power. What if she forces us to
becomie an efficient industrial power?
It depends on the purpose. Modern industry is much alike in
all countries and its conditions of efficiency are much the same.
But the purposes for which it is used may differ. If our purpose
is to make use of our people in order to gain more power for the
state over other nations, then, as contributing to that purpose
we shall raise capital by taxation and invest it in navies and armaments
and shall back up speculative investments abroad. If our
purpose is to open up our own resources for future billions of
surplus capital and for future millions of population, then we
shall raise capital, also largely by taxation, but shall invest it
in those basic industries which no longer can be left to speculation.
Only government can choose which of these purposes shall be
first. The will of the state decides. And already have American
democracy and the Supreme Court begun to point out both the
theory and the practice by which the American government may
give a preference to domestic investment over foreign investment.

### ---Economics-1919-0-01.txt---
men, one of the most notable is the keener desire which we all now
feel to be of genuine public service. During the war hundreds of
our members have done "war work." In Washington alone one
hundred and twenty of them have been in public service.
During the impending world-reconstruction, economists will
probably have more opportunity to satisfy this impulse than
most students in other departments of human thought; for the
great problems of reconstruction are largely economic.
It therefore becomes each of us, as we pause on the threshold
of a possible "new world," to consider what are the new opportunities
and what the new duties which lie before us. That new
world of which we are all speaking is still unbuilt. Is it to build
itself, unplanned, or is it to have architects? And are we to be
numbered among the architects? These are undoubtedly some of
the thoughts and hopes and fears which stir us today.
How different they are from those of our own economic teachers
a generation ago! Then many economists thought it beneath their
dignity to engage at all in practical affairs except to cry: "Laissez
faire." They believed that a scientist should be simply an observer,
compiler, and interpreter of facts, not a guide, counsellor,
and friend of humanity.
It is noteworthy that their attitude of academic aloofness not
only failed to give to economic study, in the eyes of the world, that
status of a "true science" which they claimed for it but, on the
contrary, brought it into disrepute and provoked a vigorous reaction.
The world demanded that economics should become something
more than "the dismal science."
Accordingly, a new economics sprang up, intent on "doing
something." This new school was centered in Germany as the
older "Manchester School" was centered in England.
When the American Economic Association was founded thirtythree
years ago the antagonism between these two schools was at
its height. In fact, we owe the formation of this Association
clhiefly to that antagonism. A number of young American economists,


### ---Economics-1919-0-02.txt---
fresh from the inspiration of study in Germany, were eager
to conivert American economists to a new and more optimistic
point of view.

The chief American economists of that time, however, regarded
the young enthusiasts just back from Germany as upstarts, meddlers,
and propagandists, unworthy of any standing in the hierarchy
of true economic science. Some of them, like my own revered
master, Professor Sumner, even declined to join the American
Economic Association for fear of lending aid and comfort to
a propaganda with which they were wholly out of sympatlhy.
It was doubtless in viewv of this strong feeling on both sides that
the Economic Association when formed was strictly limited as to
its functions. As our constitution says, its object is:
"The encouragement of perfect freedom of economic discussion.
The Association as such will take no partisan attitude, nor will it
commit its members to any position on practical economic questions.
"

A year and a half ago, after America entered the war, some of
our modern enthusiasts proposed that the Association should endeaver
to find, and do, its "bit" for the country. The objection
was promptly interposed that, as an organization, we had no
"bit" to do; for we were apparently prohibited by our constitution
from taking any "partisan attitude" or committing our members
to "any position on practical economic questions." But a
few moniths afterward, that is, a year ago, after much debate a
proposal to appoint a Committee on the Purchasing Power of
MIoney in Relation to the War was adopted, and later the Executive
Committee appointed a number of other committees on war
problems, including committees on War Finance, Foreign Trade,
Price Fixing, Marketing, and Labor. Some of these committees
have done work of great service to the country.
I mention tlhese incidents in our history, as a text from which
to draw certain lessons. What I most wish to point out concerns
not so much the attitude of the Association as such but the attitude
of its members as individuals.
The conflict between those economists who were conservative
and those who were radical in regard to applying academic study
may be resolved into two separate questions or issues. The first
is: Should economists remain in academic seclusion, concerned
principally with pure theory and leaving the vulgar world to take
care of itself, or should they seek practical applications for their


### ---Economics-1919-0-03.txt---
principles? The second is: Granted that we should serve, exactly
whom should we serve?
To the first of these questions the radicals have, in my opinion,
given the better answer. Even the economic recluse selects, if he
can, some theme related to human affairs and fondly hopes that
his work may be taken up and utilized by practical men. It must
be admitted, however, that most economists even yet depend too
much on books and official reports and too little on personally
feeling the pulse of real events.
But it is the second question which most needs our attention
today: Whom are we to serve? To this, I believe, the conservatives
have given the better answer.
Economics may be applied for the benefit of the whole world
or for the benefit of one country alone. Again, within a country,
economics may be applied for the general good or for a
special commercial interest, special class, or special locality.
I have referred to the curiously interesting fact that this Association
largely owes its birth to German economics. Undoubtedly
German economics brought us a new and altruistic impulse.
In particular we received from Germany the idea, close to the
heart of every German economist, of making economics of service
to "the state."

But in the last two years the war's revelations have made us
realize, to our horror, that "tthe state" served by the German
economists, or, at any rate, the German economists of today, was
simply the Hohenzollern dynasty. We now know that German
professors in general, from theologian to chemist, have prostituted
their professional services to serve Germany's criminal purposes.
Frederick Scott Oliver in his "Ordeal by Battle" called the
professors the "Priestcraft" throuigh whom the German Governnent
indoctrinatedl the German people. Professor Emnery called
the war a war of the economic interpretation of history. Others
have called it a professors' war and especially an economic professor'
s' war. Some among the very group of German teachers
who stirred the enthusiasm out of which this Association grew, and
more among their successors, in their service of "the state," lhelped
to lay the foundation for the war. That foundation, or the part
of it which they helped to lay, was a predatory economics, the
economics of a beast of prey, the economics of loot by war. In
this species of economics, property rights had existence onNr
within the state, not between states.


### ---Economics-1919-0-04.txt---
Even before the war Germany's policy of foreign trade was
thoroughly selfish. Transportation and manufacturing interests,
backed by the German banks and the German army and navy had
gone into the foreign markets to expel the commerce of other
countries by fair means or foul, all for the national aggrandizement
of Germany.

In view of these facts it clearly behooves us just now to undergo
a searching self-examination lest this same fatal taint may
lurk in our own American economics which we have taken, in part,
from Germany. If we contrast German and English economics,
we cannot but be struck by the narrowness and selfishness of the
former as contrasted with the breadth and liberality of the latter.
The contrast is exemplified by the difference between the spirit of
"Free Trade" and "Protection." Though the English policy was
dictated in large part by the conviction that it represented England'
s own interests in the long run, the great fact remains that
these interests were not sought at the expense of other peoples
but on the principle that both parties gained by a trade, and in
the thought that nothing more than free, fair, open competition
ought to be sought. This doctrine of "live and let live" has in it
few seeds of war.

If, now, at the final peace negotiations, the German style of
economics is to dominate, the settlement will degenerate into a
race for position "and the Devil take the hindmost." If the Allies
should repudiate their own ideas, namely, the ideas of international
reciprocity in trade relations and of the open door, and
each should merely seek to secure all it could of territory, colonies,
trade concessions, special investment rights, exclusive ports,
coaling stations, canals, railway routes, and discriminatory tariffs,
the Peace table will turn into a gamblers' table, on which will be
dealt out the cards for the next great game of war, and, as often
happens after a war, the ideas and ideals of the conquered will
have made conquest over those of the conquerors.
America has a special opportunity, a special mission-to uphold
humanitarian and democratic economics. The very fact that
Germany once inspired us toward an economics in the service of
the state should spur us now to avoid the nationalistic perversions
of that idea which befell our German colleagues. Any American
economist who hereafter lends his talents to serve and inflame a
hoggish chauvinism, is betraying the high ideals and purposes of
America in this war. For instance, even if a more liberal tariff


### ---Economics-1919-0-05.txt---
policy than that existing before the war were not mutually advantageous,
even if such a trade involved an econiomic sacrifice to
us as a nation, it would none the less truly be required of us today
in order to continue and establish on a permanent foundation that
chivalry which has characterized America's part in the war. The
call of the hour is to be just and generous. The concept of international
obligation has been born. Henceforth any international
arrangements must find their justification in international fairness,
not in unfair national advantage. Whatever "place in the
sun" we seek for ourselves, we must accord to every other nation,
small and great, weak and strong, new and old. The golden rule
must be the rule between nations as well as within a nation.
The proposed League of Nations is part and parcel of this
great idea of international justice now having its new birth and
baptism. Such a league is not only a political necessity as a preventive
of war; it is also an economic necessity as a preventive of
the economic burdens of militarism.
Like our own league of forty-eight states, it would obviate the
necessity of great armaments. Without such a league we must
resume competitive armaments-must, for instance, as our naval
men tell us, compete with England in naval strength; and further
competition in armies and navies would mean economic ruin to
Europe and great impoverishment to the United States. There
are two important special reasons why this would be true. One
is that the world, especially Europe, is so nearly exhausted economically
that even the old military burdens would now be far
harder to bear than before the war. The other is that the renewed
competition would be far more costly than the old, since
we would start off with all the huge equipment which the war
itself has brought.

Secondly, we must be on our guard against the bias of special
interests. This bias enters largely into much thinking on the subject
of the League to Enforce Peace, for there are interests which
would thwart this new and great idea, fearing that the new regime
may upset the old to which they and their private purses had become
well adjusted.

The great question, then, is: Are we, in our internal economics,
to serve the nation as a whole or are we to serve a special group
within the nation?

There can be no objection to an individual economist associating
himself with a special business and putting his talents at its


### ---Economics-1919-0-06.txt---
disposal, provided, of course, he does so openly, and provided the
business is legitimate, that is, provided his activities are not inconsistent
with the general welfare.
Academnic economists, from their very openmindedness, are apt
to be carried off, unawares, by the bias of the community in which
they live.

Economists whose social world is Wall Street are very apt to
take the Wall Street point of view, while economtists at state universities
situated in farming districts are apt to be partisans of
the agricultural interests.
The economists of a century ago were unconsciously writing
from the standpoint of the employer rather than from that of
the employee, as was shiown by their references to labor as an expense
of production. Today, on the contrary, as labor is increasing
in power, we find many economists are, consciously or unconsciously,
taking the point of view of the laborer. This comes
closer to being the democratic, humanitarian, or public point of
view, but is often in real antagonism to it. Trade unionism, socialism,
and even Bolshevism, syndicalism, or I. W. W.ism have
occasional champions or apologists among economists. Socialism
especially h-as enlisted under its banner a motley group of theorists
eager for some realization of their humanitarian intentions.
In a sense, of course, "we are all socialists nowadays." But what
should give us pause before enrollilng under that banner is that, in
reality, it is the red flag of class war. Whatever we may say
of theoretical socialism of various types, and however muclh we
may and ought, in my opinlion, to favor in some form an increase
of socialized industry, the great fact remains that the socialist
group derives its real strengtlh from class antagonism. This is
even truer of the I. W. W. A few weeks ago a workman in the
I. W. W. wrote me: "Nothing could give me a greater pleasure
than to have an opportunity to exterminate from the globe every
capitalist. That time is coming, thank God !" The Dutch minister
at Petrograd recently said: "Translated into practice, the
Bolsheviki principles are 'high wages for no work, the taking of
others' property without punishment, and no taxation.'"
There can be little doubt that we are facing a great peril today,
the peril of perverting the democracy for which we have just been
fighting with such devotion.
It is our opportunity and our duty to dedicate ourselves to the
task of working out economic ineasuires in the interests of humanity


### ---Economics-1919-0-07.txt---
and democracy as against the selfish interests of either the
capitalist or the laborer as such.
If we jealously guard our independence and impartiality we
snall gain for our profession the enviable position of being the
logical arbiters of the class struggle now beginning-arbiters
which both sides can trust. We may, and should, take sides, but
only as a just judge takes sides when he renders his decision and
only after a fair weighing of the evidence.
WATe may be sure that there will be a bitter struggle over the
distribution of wealth until a more or less definite readjustment
has been found. Professor King of the University of Wisconsin
has shown that something like two-thirds of our people have no
capital except the clothes on their backs and a little furniture and
personal belongings, while the major part of our capital is owned
by less than two per cent of the population. The income-distribution
is not quite so unequal. About lhalf of our national income
is received by one-fourth of our population. There is evidence to
show that this striking inequality of distribution of capital and
income is increasing and that it is greater in cities than in the
country. Still more distressing is the fact that, since the twentietli
century began, wages reckoned in commodities, not money,
have been actually decreasing while profits have been increasing.
The purchasing power of wages over food in 1917 was only a little
over two-thirds of what it was ten years before. The extraordinarily
high wages of 1918 among certain forms of skilled labor
are, of course, not representative.
The real scientific study of the distribution of wealth has, we
must confess, scarcely begun as yet. The conventional academic
study of the so-called theory of distribution into rent, interest,
wages, and profits is only remotely related to the subject. This
subject, the causes and cures for the actual distribution of capital
and income among real persons, is one of the many now in need
of our best efforts as scientific students of society. I shall here
merely throw into the discussion a few tentative thoughts which
seem to me to be now either completely overlooked or only dimly
appreciated.

There are, I believe, two master keys to the distribution of
wealth: the Inheritance system and the Profit system.
The practices which happen to be followed by men of great
wealth in making wills is certainly the chief determinant of the
distribution of their wealtlh after their deatlh. Mr. Albert G.


### ---Economics-1919-0-08.txt---
Coyle, one of my former students, has estimated that four-fifths
of the one hundred and fifty or more fortunes in the United States
having incomes of over $1,000,000 a year have been accumulating
for two generations or more. It is interesting to observe that, although
the formulae expressing distribution by Pareto's logarithmic
law are similar for the United States and England, the number
of wealthy men at the top is two and a quarter times as great,
in proportion to population, in England as in the United States,
presumably because the number of generations through which
fortunes have been inherited are much greatL- there than here.
Yet the man who wills property does so without regard to its
effect on the social distribution of wealth. In fact even from the
private point of view careful thought is seldom bestowed on the
solemn responsibility of bequeathing property. The ordinary
millionaire capitalist about to leave this world forever cares less
about what becomes of the fortune he leaves behind than we have
been accustomed to assume. Contrary to a common opinion, he
did not lay it up, at least not beyond a certain point, because of
any wish to leave it to others. His accumulating motives were
rather those of power, of self-expression, of hunting big game.
I believe that it is very bad public policy for the living to allow
the dead so large and unregulated an influence over us. Even in
the eye of the law there is no natural right, as is ordinarily falsely
assumed, to will property. "The right of inheritance," says Chief
Justice Coleridge of England, "a purely artificial right, has been
at different times and in different countries very variously dealt
with. The institution of private property rests only upon the
general advantage." And again, Justice McKenna of the United
States Supreme Court says: "The right to take property by
devise or descent is the creature of the law and not a natural
right-a privilege, and therefore the authority which confers it
may impose conditions on it."
The disposal of property by will is thus simply a custom, one
handed down to us from Ancient Rome. It is no more inviolate
than the custom of the disposal of the body of the dead by burial.
Just as, in the interests of the living, we are substituting cremation
for burial, so-likewise in the interests of the living-we may
substitute a new for a traditional method of disposing of the
dead man's goods.

Numerous limitations of the right to will property do, in fact,
already exist in each of our states-some under common law, others


### ---Economics-1919-0-09.txt---
under statute law. There are, in particular, restrictions
against tying up property (except in charitable bequests) in perpetuity.
These restrictions have, undoubtedly, restrained the accumulation
of swollen fortunes. There is no reason why we cannot
continue to, add to such limitations so far as seems wise.
For instance, Rignano, the Italian economist, suggests making
the state co-heir of all bequests so that it will receive one-third of
the estate on the first descent, two-thirds of the remainder on the
second, and the residue on the third descent.
So much for the first great factor responsible for an undemocratic
distribution of wealth-the inheritance system. It has to
do with the transmission of fortunes from one generation to another.
The other great factor, the profit system, has to do with
the mushroom growth of a fortune in a single generation.
When fortunes are made with prodigious speed, it is usually
wholly or chiefly through profits. Accumulation by compound interest,
though amazing in its possibilities after a fortune is large,
cannot in a single lifetime make a large fortune out of a small
one. Every "self-made" millionaire, so far as I know, became
such, if honestly, primarily through profits. Profits are the
chance part of distribution, the part which is the uncertain, and
therefore extremely variable, margin left after the more fixed and
known parts of the distribution-rent, interest, wages, and salaries-
have been deducted.

Profits are, next to wages, the most importaiit element of our
national income, comprising over a quarter therof and being more
important than rent and interest combined.
My query here is: May we not find ways, by legislation and
otherwise, of modifying more or less profoundly the present profit
system? I have in mind not only profit-sharing plans, plans for
co6perative producing, buying or distributing, and schemes for
allotting common stock to employees by which the worker may
feel a stake in the business in which he is engaged; but also, and
more particularly, possible participating by the public itself
through the government.
I am aware, of course, of the obvious and real objections to
such plans and I am not offering a solution of this problem, but
su,ggesting what seems to me a promising line in which we economists
may seek!a solution. Perhaps there are many different solutions,
varying according to circumstances. It may well be that
a place will always be left for pure private ownership and management,


### ---Economics-1919-0-10.txt---
as well as a place for pure government ownership, even
though a mixed system or systems, such as I have in mind as possible,
be placed between.

We already have some examples of mixed types, such as government
regulation; leases to private capitalists with reversionary
rights to the city, state, or nation; subsidies; price fixing; guaranteeing
prices; underwriting against loss; taxes on profits or on
excess profits.

The important point is that, under the present private-profit
system, the chance of profits and risk of losses as well as the management
are entirely in the hands of one only of the three classes
interested in the success of the enterprise. The other two classes,
namely, the workers and the public, do not ordinarily participate
much, if at all. The enterpriser or chance-taker has, under this
system, come to think and to speak of his industry as "my business"
and gets quoted even as saying "the public be damned."
For instance, we entrust the great public function of conducting
our public press to irresponsible private capitalists who in turn
are largely controlled by their advertisers, even more irresponsible.
Fundamentally the question is one of adequately representing
the parties whose interests are involved. Only incidentally is it a
question of efficiency. Yet I believe the two are not so far apart
as is often supposed. An efficient autocracy in industry is as
suicidal in the end as an efficient autocracy in politics has shown
itself to be. Either is unstable because unrepresentative. The
most enduring of great banks is the Bank of England because it
is based not on a narrow money-making efficiency, but on the idea
of efficiency for public service. Even its governor represents not
the banker in the English sense but the "merchant," a merchant
banker who stands partly for the public whom the banker serves.
Yet the Bank of England is technically a private bank. Its great
merit is that the bank's customers, including the government, participate
in shaping its policy.
While government enterprise has glaring defects, the present
system of private profit is zalso defective. It is even very costly
to the public in that the enterpriser requires the chance of large
profits to compensate for the large risks he asssumes. Two unfortunate
consequences follow. One is that in this great game of
chance the lottery winnings make multimillionaires out of millionaires,
which is inconsistent with democratic ideals and democratic
progress. The other is that it creates hostility on the part


### ---Economics-1919-0-11.txt---
of the other two classes. The workman therefore is over-ready to
strike, shirk, or commit sabotage. The local public often cordially
hate a great railway like the Pennsylvania system or the Southern
Pacific at whose mercy they are, or a great corporation, trust or
bank, which they call an "octopus." From such hostility comes a
contest for political power and, too often, corruption. This corruption
should not all be charged up to politics as such; for much
of it is due to private industry struggling for private profits in
disregard of public usefulness.
The government, representing the public, is, with all its faults,
in a better position than the private capitalist to underwrite great
industrial undertakings, both because its resources are greater and
because the chances iof gains and losses in many different directions
would tend, more fully, to offset each other. Government
underwriting of industry is thus in the last analysis simply a
species of social insuriance.
It is interesting to observe that such social insurance as we are
now familiar with-workmen's compensation, health insurance,
etc.-usually provides that the cost and management shall be
shared by the three parties interested, employer, employee, and
state.

Nor is such an extension of the principle of social insurance as
I am now tentatively suggesting so strange as it may at first appear.
It is just what we have seen happen under the stress of
war. Early in the war the profit system by which the government
let out to contractors the making of munitions and other
supplies was found to be not only very expensive but to work very
badly. We therefore hastily improvised many kinds of government
regulation to meet the situation. The important point for
us to note here is that the government thus assumed some of the
commercial risks and insured others against them. To secure an
adequate wheat supply it guaranteed to the farmer the price of
wheat, while, at the same time, it protected the public against
"Cprofiteering" in prices of bread. In taking over the railways it
guaranteed certain minimum profits. It assumed the most of the
risks in shipbuilding. It supplied a revolving fund to loan to essential
industries which would otherwise run the risk of not securing
needed capital. It put government officials in charge of
munition works which, under private management, were in danger
of failing to give the needed service to the country. It did all
these things clumsily; but it had to do something because private


### ---Economics-1919-0-12.txt---
enterprise failed or could not be depended on to render the service
to the country which the country needed and demanded.
Even before the war there were many examples of some sort of
government participation. Railways were often built in part by
subsidy of nation, state, or locality, in order that the public interest
might be served. Irrigating, forestry, and water power development
have had government ownership or participation in
various forms. Abroad, both town and nation are sometimes coowners
with individuals in the forests.
I may add that, in my opinion, the rather common idea that
profits should be limited to a "fair rate of interest" is not a solution
of the difficulty. It is as absurd and unfair as the socialists'
dictum that profits are essentially stolen from workmen's wages.
Nothing would serve so effectually to kill enterprise as to forbid
the enterpriser from securing more profits than he could get by
lending his money, unless at the same time we protect him against
losses. Some one must assume the risks of enterprise, and he
who assumes the risks of loss is entitled to the chance of profits.
As long as we keep the system by which the private capitalist is,
single handed, to struggle to win wealth from natural resources,
we must give him the chance of winning big prizes together with
the chance of great losses.
Needless to say, therefore, I am not attacking the man who
takes profits under the present system. He ought not, or not
always, to be stigmatized as a profiteer. Nor am I attacking the
man who wills his property in the ordinary way. Both are playing
the game according to the present rules. My criticism is not
of the players, but of the rules. New rules may be found-rules
better for both the players and the onlookers.
Our society will always remain an unstable and explosive compound
as long as political power is vested in the masses and economic
power in the classes. In the end one of these powers will
rule. Either the plutocracy will buy up the democracy or the
democracy will vote away the plutocracy. In the meantime the
corrupt politician will thrive as a concealed broker between the
two.

On the face of it, we should expect that all the evils mentioned
would be relieved if we had more democracy in industry, that is,
if the workman and the public felt that the great industries were
partly theirs, both as to ownership and as to management.
As to the representation of workmen in the management, some


### ---Economics-1919-0-13.txt---
industries have introduced a "Senate" to represent the office staff
and a "House of Representatives" to represent the shop workers.
These, with the executive, exercising a veto power, manage the industry
after the pattern of our political republic. This and
other plans for a more representative control are worth careful
study. A large part of our present dissatisfaction with industry
comes from its autocratic control, which is growing more rapidly
centralized even than is the actual ownership. The device of the
corporation, especially the holding corporation, has put a large
fraction of the capital of the country into the hands of a small
group, of magnates mostly in New York City.
So much for the distribution and control of wealth. There are
other subjects equally worthy of our attention. Even if the,distribution
of wealth could be ideal, the industrial world would find
abundant reason for discontent. Just as the political freedom
sought by the French Revolution proved insufficient and disappointing,
so will what is now called economic freedom be found
insufficient and disappointing.
When we speak, however figuratively, of wage-slavery, we ought
to think not only of low wages, but also of the repulsiveness of
the work itself. The great reason why an industry fascinates the
employer but bores the employee is, in my opinion, that human
psychologic laws are neglected.
I hope that psychologists may some day, in cooperation with
economists, help to a truer understanding of the nature of human
freedom. What we liberty lovers are really groping for is, apparently,
not to do as we think we please but to do what will
actually please us after it is done; that is, to satisfy fairly well
all of the great fundamental human instincts, of which there are
many besides the instinct of self-preservation or of making a living.
The workman not only longs for more pay, but he hungers
and thirsts for other things which he cannot formulate, because
so largely unconscious.
The problem of making manual workers contented, or as contented
as the rest of us, or as contented as they can be, is not,
therefore, a problem simply of the distribution of wealth. It is
one of introducing, or re-introducing, certain fundamental motives
into industry. Just as the large capitalist does not usually
accumulate for his children but for the love of accumulating, and
just as inventors (as Professor Taussig has shown) do not usually
invent merely, or even chiefly, for money but for the love of


### ---Economics-1919-0-14.txt---
inventing, so the workman can be motivated also by quite different
motives from the ordinary pay-envelope motive. I refer to the
creative and other impulses emphasized at this session by Mr.
Robert B. Wolf and others, and by Miss Marot and Ordway Tead
in their books, as well as a year ago in our Philadelphia meeting
by the late Professor Carleton Parker (whose important pioneer
work will, I hope, never be forgotten).
The war affords us a great object lesson here. Men previouslv
apathetic in the shop, under the money motive, have exhibited a
wonderful eagerness to fight for their country with no wages to
speak of and with no money bonus whatever. Again, when the
armistice was signed, this wonderful "morale" shrank appreciably
overnight. Still again, we find that many of the soldiers who return
to work after the excitements of military life are actually
spoiled as workmen. We must find ways of putting real "pep"
into the worker-for his sake as well as others'. Perhaps a wiser
employment management can and will spread over the country as
a result of the war and, in particular, of the studies of the War
Industries Board with its 13 courses and 275 graduates fitted
thereby to become employment managers. Perhaps the labor men
can take the initiative. Either or both might happen through
several agencies, including the Industrial Department of the Y.
M. C. A.

We economists ought to be able to play an important
part, in co6peration with psychologists, employers, and employees,
by studying this new movement, distilling out the essential truths
it represents, and contributing constructive suggestions of our
own. The psychologist and the religious workers helped vastly in
creating our soldiers' morale. Cannot the morale needed in industry
be secured with equal success? If we can and do secure it,
it will be by making industry really democratic. And if we do
secure it, the productivity of industry will be greatly increased
because those who have its success at heart and put their own interest
and initiative into that success will include the millions of
workers and not merely the thousands of employers.
Here again the war teaches us a great lesson. The miraculous
accomplishments of the United States were due not to a centralized
organizing genius, such as created German military power in forty
years, but to a decentralized cooperation whereby each citizen, of
his own initiative, tried to do his "bit." Not only was the war a
triumph of democracy over autocracy but it demonstrated the efficiency


### ---Economics-1919-0-15.txt---
of the democratic method, that is, the method which relies
on enlisting the active initiative, the enthusiastic interest and will
to help, of the people. The Prussian method has failed and the
Prussian method in American industry has failed and always will.
These problems of industrial discontent are only some of the
great problems now before us.
There is not time even to sketch the others. One of them concerns
the rehabilitation of monetary standards, including not
simply resumption of specie payments and restoration of pars of
exchange but maintenance of purchasing power. I have often
spoken and written on this theme. Here, as always, we must beware
of the bias-and I am sorry to say, I know of one economist
who has not escaped it-of special interests, whether of the gold
miner or silver miner or of the creditor or debtor-interests.
The great field of social insurance for workingmen and especially
the next step-Health Insurance-should also engage our
attention. Here, likewise, we must steer clear of the bias of the
employer, the trade union, the insurance company, or the medical
profession.

The problem of demobilization, especially the problem of preventing
unemployment during the period of readjustment and the
problem of the future occupation in industry or settlement on
land of our soldiers, especially those invalided, are also before us.
These and other problems of reconstruction are the basis of our
meeting this year, as our program shows. The thoughts we receive
at this annual meeting should help all of us who are in earnest
to reach conclusions on these topics, if not here and now, soon
afterward, and so be of service in shaping American policy in the
immediate future.

In order that our influence may be fully exerted, I believe two
new agencies are needed-one designed to diffuse such economic
knowledge as we possess among the people who do not possess it,
and the other designed to increase that knowledge.
At present we college men are, in a sense, teaching the wrong
people. We reach a college audience which is not only small but
is, I think most teachers will agree, less in need of our elementary
teachings than the general public.
An urgent need, in my opinion, is some organized machinery for
diffusing economic principles among the masses of our population.
The common people, whose ideas will, more and more, rule
the world, are in crying need of competent instruction in economics,
simplified and reduced to its lowest terms.


### ---Economics-1919-0-16.txt---
In a democracy the people express their opinion on economic
problems, but without much opportunity, in the first instance, to
make that opinion intelligent. Workmen now act on the ideas,
often fallacious even from the standpoint of labor alone, of labor
leaders woefully ignorant of the fundamental principles of economics.
It is for lack of economic enlightenment that they approve
of limitation of output, extravagant expenditure on public
works, slackness and inefficiency !of workmen, exclusion or destruction
of "labor saving" machinery, sabotage, limitation of apprentices,
cessation of trade schools, etc. In so doing they are
laboring under a "make work" delusion. Likewise, they are apt
to cry out for more money in times of inflation, under a money
delusion. It is encouraging to note, however, that recently some
labor elements, especially the English, as indicated by their recent
manifesto on Reconstruction, have become emancipated from most
of these doctrines.

The second suggestion is that there should be created an endowment
for economic research, in the management of which labor,
capital, and economists would, all three, share and which would be
a sort of laboratory for the study of the great economic problems
before us. Today the physical sciences have their great laboratories,
as a matter of course. But the economist is expected to
secure his own facts and statistics and make his own calculations
at his own expense. Expensive research, far beyond the reach
of the professor's purse, is necessary if the economist is to be of
any important public service in studying wealth distribution, the
profit system, the problem of labor unrest, and the other many
pressing practical problems. Harvard University, through its
Committee on Economic Research, and other Research Bureaus,
are now making a beginning in this direction.
Such an endowment as has recently been suggested might be
under the auspices of this Association or otherwise guarded
against narrow or partisan control.
Certainly if we are to serve the great world democracy which
we hope to see arise from the ashes of this great world conflagration,
we must see the problem whole.
Our present opportunity is one which, if now missed, may never
come again. The war has kindly lifted us, for a time, out of the
old ruts. Consequently the world is far more open-minded, more
expectant, and more desirous of getting at the real truth of things
today than ever before. But as the years roll by ruts will be worn


### ---Economics-1919-0-17.txt---
again and, once worn wrongly, may be harder than ever to efface
or correct.

It is given to us as to no previous generation of economists to
share in fixing the foundations for a new economic organization
and one which shall harmonize with the principles of democracy.
If we are to succeed it will be because we perform our task with
wisdom, unselfishness, and impartiality. As economists in public
service in a democratic world we are pledged not to serve simply
our local community, our own country, or our own time, but to
serve rather all humanity throughout the world and throughout
future generations.

There can be no question that for the student of economics the
war has been a distinct boon. The strain to which our economic
system was suddenly subjected has thrown new light on its structure
and working, has revealed weaknesses in current economic
reasoning, and suggested new evaluations of the forces at work in
economic life. Such an experience is bound to add to the body of
economic knowledge and suggest new methods of approach to
economic problems. That suclh has been the case there is abundant
evidence in the papers and discussions at our annual meetings.
Some economists, indeed, seem to have lost faith in the general
validity of the principles of economic science as it has been gradually
built up since the time of Adam Smitlh, to believe that it must
be in large measure discarded and an effort made to build on new
foundations. There are various reasons for this feeling: the failure
of economists to predict accurately the effect of the war upon
the course of economic events; the progress made in the study of
psychology and its bearing upon the understanding of the motives
of human action; the feeling that economic reasoning has been
based upon the assumption of the permanence of existing institutions,
failing to recognize both that these institutions are subject
to change and that they are themselves the controlling factors
in economic life and should therefore furnish the main body of material
for economic science. None of these criticisms is new but
the proceedings of our recent meetings show that they are being
urged with special force at the present time.
While no economist would for a moment suggest that his science
has reached, or ever will reach, its final form, while the experience
through which we are passing and the criticisms to which reference
has been made may contain contributions of great value to its
progress, it may be questioned whether they are as destructive in
their effect as some would appear to believe. Prediction is the
severest test to which our knowledge can be put. It is possible


### ---Economics-1920-0-02.txt---
only when the forces at work are few and their action thoroughly
understood, i.e., within a narrow range of the phenomena of the
external world. It is and always must be extremely uncertain in
the field of human action where the forces at work are indefinitely
numerous and but partially understood.
It is true that many economists as well as others underestimated
the reserve labor power which modern nations can call into action
and the extent to which they can readjust their economic machinery
when the spirit of self-sacrifice and patriotic enthusiasm has
been strongly awakened among their peoples, and that they therefore
predicted that financial and economic exhaustion would end
the war sooner than it did. But Europe was practically at the
end of its resources, financial and economic, when the war closed.
Fortunately the resources of our own country, when under these
conditions they were thrown into the scale, turned the balance
decisively and we were not called upon to undergo the test of endurance.


It is true that economists for the same reasons and because they
failed to make proper allowance for the temporary effects of inflation,
the influence of the newly established federal reserve system,
and the possibilities of organized appeals to patriotism, predicted
a rise in the rate of interest earlier than it actually occurred
in this country, but they were right in their analysis of the fundamental
influences at work. The rise has begun in the case of longtime
investments, although in the case of short-time loans it is still
retarded by the increase in our facilities for discount due to the
establishment of the federal reserve system, the great importation
of gold during the early years of the war, and the creation of some
25 billions of new securities in the form of public debt which have
been made available as collateral for loans at low rates of interest.
But even under these conditions the capacity of banks to loan is
not inexhaustible and there are indications that this fact is beginning
to be realized.

In 1914 I suppose practically all economists would have agreed
that a war such as we have been through accompanied by a great
expansion of money and credits and the destruction of wealth
would cause a rise in prices to be followed by a fall after the close
of the war. As a matter of fact, prices have continued to rise and
today, in the ligllt of experience with new forces, brought into
operation by the war itself, many seem to doubt whether the fall
will come. I venture to predict that here too, unless there is to


### ---Economics-1920-0-03.txt---
be a permanent decrease of production or the abandonment of all
at-tempt by the wNorld at large to escape froimi a (lepreciated paper
basis, the error of the economists of 1914 will prove to be in the
time required for fundamnental economic forces to work out their
result and not in the ultimate result itself. The influences which
retard the fall in prices are the same influences which retard the
rise of interest rates. When these influences are exhausted and the
fall in prices occurs, it may also be found that what we might
term the real interest rates, the burden imposed upon tlhe borrower,
the per cent on value actually received which he has contracted
to repay, have risen more rapidly than nominal rates.
In the face of what I have said concerning the danger of prophecy,
and of what seems to be the tendency of events at the moment,
I will venture one more prediction strictly in accord with
the current theory of econolmiics. As a result of the war the
United States has changed from a debtor to a creditor nation
and bids fair to again take its place in the ocean carrying trade.
For ne-arly fifty years we have had a so-called favorable balance of
trade which has been tremendously increased by the war.
The permanent as distinguished from the temporary influences
set in operation by the war are working, however, towards an increase
of imports relatively to exports. We cannot expect permanently
to maintain the great excess of exports over imports
which has characterized our commerce since 1873. This readjustment
of our trade balance may be teinporarily modified and
postponed by continue(l grants of foreign credits, by investments
in foreign securities, and large expenditures by American travellers
abroad. It is bound to come in the end. I make no predictions
as to the time involved.
But if the war has made clear that economic science has not
yet reached a stage of conmpleteness which affords a secure basis
for prophecy, so far at least as the timne required for its fulfilment
is concerned, it has without question confirmed the truth of certain
fundamental facts and principles which lie at the basis of the
current teaching of economics. Nothing could have brought out
mnore clearly than did the war the truth, taught in every class in
elementary economrlics, that the fundamental economic facts and
processes are the same uinder our higlhly organized industrial system
as in the most primitive coinmunity, that the measure of man's
economic power is hiis ability to produce the goodls whieli le needs,


### ---Economics-1920-0-04.txt---
and that the elabora-le system of exchange and finance which has
been built up is but a piece of mechanism for the furtherance of
this end.

On the basis of our war experience it is easy to make clear that
our power of productioni is limited; that if we would increase the
production of certain goods, we must economize our consumption
of others; that economy in consumption, saving, is the essential
condition of the creation of capital; that war finance is the placing
of the labor and capital of the country at the disposal of the government;
that financial operations are not an independent means,
but merely the mechanism for accomplishing this purpose; and
that the slogan, "business as usual," in the face of a great national
emergency which diminishes our labor force and requires the diversion
of labor into new lines of industry is an evident fallacy.
On the whole, economists need not be discouraged by results of
the test to which generally accepted principles of economics have
been subjected by the war.
It is certain that we have much to learn concerning the influences
which govern human action, but there seems no reason to believe
that we have erred in assuming that laborers prefer the job
that yields the highest pay; that sellers desire to sell in the dearest
and buyers to buy in the cheapest market; that the organizers
of business seek the industries which promise the largest returns
over expenses of production; that men desire to escape, if possible,
the competition of others supplying or consuming like goods and
services; that the utilization of limited natural resources is subject
to the law of diminishing returns; or that goods or services
are valued on the basis of their marginal utilities.
So long as these assumptions remain true, and men are allowed
free choice of occupations and left to determine their relations
to each other by mutual agreement among themselves, the outline
of the theory of exchange and distribution will remain what it is
although additional knowledge will enable us to fill in the outline
more completely than is now possible.
Our social institutions are subject to change and these changes
bring changes in the structure and working of our economic system.
It is of great importance to understand the course and effects
of such changes, but it is equally important to understand
the working of the economic system under the institutions that
exist. Except for considerations of stability and uniformity in
our economic nomenclature it does not seem to be of vital importance


### ---Economics-1920-0-05.txt---
whether we designate as economic theory one or the other
body of knowledge or the -two combined.
There remain many tasks for the student of economic theory,
but I doubt whether as a result of the experience of the war, or of
the progress which has been made in other branches of knowledge,
he is called upon to tear down the structure which has been gradually
built up during the last one hundred and fifty years anid begin
anew. The great problem which faces us today is not the problem
of reconstructing economic theory, but the problem of adequately
developing the art of economics or of what may perhaps be termed
economic engineering.
It is a familiar fact that the economic system which grew out
of the Industrial Revolutioni contains elements of great strength
combined with elements of serious weakness. No onle can deny that
under this system remarkable results have been achieved in extending
the industrial area utilized by people of European origin,
in supplying the world with efficient instruments of production,
and thereby enormously increasing productive power in the aggregate.


The population of Europe in the middle of the eighteenth century
is estimated at 130 millions. At the outbreak of the war the
same region supported over 450 millions in a condition of individual
well-being superior to that of the earlier period, while over 125
millions had been added to people of European descent living in
other portions of the globe. In large measure this achievement
must be attributed to the progress of physical science, but we
can easily pick out elements in our social and political institutions
to which credit is also due.
The principle of individual responsibility of each man for the
support of himself and his family has exerted a force of tremendous
power, compelling to work and tending to preserve a balance
between earning power and the growth of population. The system
of free choice of occupation, combined with freedom of contract
and private property, including the right of inlheritance and bequest,
while it has doubtless been accompanied by great waste, and
produced great inequalities in the distribution of wealth, has also
offered tremendous inducements, not to those confined, by their
lack of initiative or the limitation of their opportunities, to manual
labor, but to those who could succeed in the organization and managemen-
t of industry. These are strong points in an economic
system and are not to be lightly discarded.


### ---Economics-1920-0-06.txt---
There are equally evidlent weaknesses; the waste involvc(l in competition;
the in equiality of opportunity and bargaining power, due
to the unequal distribution of wealth, wlich tends to the formation
of econiomiiic classes and leaves potential capacity undeveloped;
the conflict over the distribution of the product of industry aind
the consequent sense of opposition of interests between those upon
whose hearty cooperation the efficiency of industry depends; the
opportunity to gain wealth through the suppression of competition
and the establishing of monopoly rather than by economic
service; the more or less haphazard character of our industrial adjustments,
involvinig waste and giving rise to alternating periods
of prosperity and depression; the lack of motive in the present
generation for safeguarding the interests of future generations;
this is but a partial list of weaknesses long recognized.
That muclh lias been done to eliminate these weaknesses and mitigate
their evil results I hlave no thought of denying, but, unfortunately
or not, neitlher individuals nor nations are incline(d to
face the serious problems of life until they are forced upon them;
anid it may be truly said that those who have had a controlling
voice in our indcustrial affairs and have prospered most under the
existing system. have been content to let matters drift so far as
the imiost serious probleims of industrial organization are concerned.


There is nothing new in the fact that great nmasses of meen in all
countries are (lissatisfie(d with the structurc- and working of the
existing economic systemrl; what is new, what the experience of
the war lhas mlade clear, is thlat witlh the extension of the suffrage,
education, and organization, these masses have acquired a definiteness
of purpose atnd a power which compels a thoroughgoinig considerationi
and possible reconstruction of our industrial systein, if
its stability is to be preserved.
Aimid the flood of radical proposals which abouind in a period
of world disorganization such as the present it is doubtless easy to
exaggerate the strength of the tendency to fundamental changes
in our social system. Those who are agitating for change are
articuilate and insistenit, but it is difficult to estimate the power
by whiclh they are backed in comparison with the inertia of the
kess articulate masses of the population. It would be foolish, however,
to close our eyes to the possibility of raidical changes in ouir
in(lustrial structure. Outr econom-ic system is exempt from clhange


### ---Economics-1920-0-07.txt---
no more than our political system. The political structure of the
western world lhas undergone radical changes during the last hundred
years and it is clear that democracy carries with it the possibility
of radical changes in industrial structure, brought about
through legal procedure. We are equally blind if we fail to see
that the hundred years which have placed political power in the
hands of the masses of the population have also changed in their
favor the balance of industrial power. These changes clearly foreshadow
chaniges in the structure of our industrial system. The
question is as to the lines which such changes must follow if they
are to be constructive ratlher than destructive and accomplish their
purpose of improving the economic condition of the masses of the
people.

Time is lacking, even had I the ability, to outline in detail the
course wlhiclh we should follow in our industrial readjustments.
M\y purpose is sinmply to call attention to certain facts wlhicl
must be recognized if we are to realize the true nature of our
problenm andcl thus avoid the mistakes and disappointmnent whicl
will follow at!liepts to solve it by methods foredoomed to failure.
There lhas been a general inclination, evident even in the case
of some economiists an(d sociologists, to assume that the problemn of
the production of wealth lhas been solved by the introduction of
power maclhinery and that the only problem wlhiclh remains is the
problem of distribution. This is due I believe to an exaggerated
estimate of the increase of productive power based on a superficial
examination of the facts and to a failure to recognize that
the enormous inicrease in aggregate productive power, which has
undoubtedly taken place, hcas to a considerable extent been absorbed
in the suipport of a popuilation increaising far more rapidly
than at any othler period of the world's history, far more rapidly
in fact than under any coniceivable condition it can continue to
increase.

The tendency to overestimate the increase in per capita productive
power during the last hundred and fifty years results from concentratinog
our attention on the more obvious and overlooking the
less obvious facets in the changes which lhave taken place.
We compare the quantity of cloth turned out in a modern cotton
mill witlh the quiantity wlich could be turned out by the same
numilber of laborers using the spinning wheel and the hand loom,
forgetting the labor whichl has gonle into the construction of the
mill and its equipmenlt and the fact that a large part of the labor


### ---Economics-1920-0-08.txt---
required for the production of cloth is employed on the plantation,
where the increase of productive power has been comparatively
slight. We compare the cost of moving a ton of freight by railway
and by wagon, but we forget that owing to the growth and
expansion of population and to its congestion in limited areas,
devoted to manlufactures and trade, goods must be carried much
longer distances than a century ago. We forget that the increase
in productive power lhas not been uniform throughout the
whole field of industry, that it has been greatest in manufactures,
mining, and transportation, and least in agriculture aiid the handling
of goods in trade, in which branches of industry is employed
a large part of the labor required in the production of the necessaries
of life. Furthermore, our industrial development, accompanied
as it has been by the growth of city life, has imposed upon
us the necessity of providing new forms of wealtlh and services
not required by a less densely settled population, such as paved
streets, sewage systems, costly plants for supplying water, police
service, and protection from fire, and has immensely increased the
difficulty of providing adequate housing.
The instances of increased power of production are striking and
appeal to the imagination. The offsets are not so obvious and are
apt to be overlooked.
Furthermore the great mass of the population which supplies
the manual labor factor in production has not benefited, and in
the nature of the case could not benefit, to the full extent of the
increase in per capita production which has taken. place. This
increase has been mainly due to invention, organization, and the
increase in the per capita equipinent of capital, none of which
would have been forthcoming in anything like the quantity actually
available except on condition of receiving a, share in the product.
Nlo matter what changes we may make in our industrial
organization, we must provide a return to these factors of production.
We may cut down their allowance but we cannot abolish
it except at the cost of industrial progress. That there has
been a substantial increase in real wages during the last hundred
years, with corresponding improvemen-i in the living conditions of
the mass of the population, there can be no question, although it
has probably been less, in this country at least, than would be indicated
by a comparison between money wages and average prices.
The major portion of the laborers' expenises are for food and rent.
Rent is not included in the general price average and has undoubtedly


### ---Economics-1920-0-09.txt---
greatly increased for city laborers, while food lhas risen
relatively to the average.
In certain directions even the lower paid portions of the manual
laboring class have made great gains. Their freedom of movement
and comiiiunication have been immensely increased. They
can acquire the foundations of an education. Through the unification
of the industrial system of the world they have escaped the
danger of recurring periods of extreme hardship due to local
scarcity. They are offered a much larger varie-ty of goods from
which to choose and enjoy certain comforts and luxuries unknown
a century and a half ago. But the iincrease in their productive
power measured in the goods essential to life has been comparatively
small.

The rapid expansion of the industry of the world has been
made possible by an apparently inexhaustible supply of low paid
labor, constantly keeping pace with the demyiand, with the result
that a large par-t of the population of even the wealthiest countries
is living close to the margin of existence. Owing to their
number and the lack of individual efficiency their marginal productivity
has been low.

So far as this low marginal productivity is attributable to excessive
numbers, conditions haive been temporarily, at least, altered
by the war. There are probably ten mnillion fewer laborers in the
western industrial world today than there would have been if
there had been no war. This condition, particularly if it is accompanied
by an increase in individual efficiency, a rapid accumulation
of capital, and a stimulus to invention, offers the possibility
of the creation of a new standard of life sufficiently strong
to control the birth rate and a consequent permanent increase in
the marginal productivity and earning power of manual laborers.
As yet, however, this is only a possibility.
Apparently before the recent fall in the value of money only
about 4 per cent of the families in this country received an income
in excess of $3,000 and seven tenths of one per cent an income
in excess of $10,000.
The success of this small minority and the very large incomes
received by a very few have raised the standard of what is regarded
as a decent and healthful condition of life, have emplhasized
inequality and bred unrest and discontent. More tlhan this,
it has set standards of extravagant expendituire all too readily,
even if naturally, imitated by the manual laborer whenever his


### ---Economics-1920-0-10.txt---
earnings exceed wlhat is required for the necessities of life. But
the fact seems to be thCat the productive power of the nation, offset
as it is by waste and misdirected energy, is still insufficient to
provide very miuch nmore than the means of a bare livrelihood for
all, even if incone were equally distributed.
We must admit that the evidence on this point is not decisive,
for our knowledge of the amoount and distribution of the national
income is far from complete. It is sufficient, however, for estimates
in the approximate accuracy of whiclh we may place considerable
confidence. The most carefully worked out estimates
are those made by King for the United States and Bowley for the
United Kiingdom, both for the period a few years preceding the
war. The results reaclhed in these two independent investigations
tend to create confidence in the substantial accuracy of each, and
both confirm the statements I lhave miade.
King estimated the an-nual product of the United States at
$30,530,000,000, a per cm pita product of $33S2. Bowley es-timate(
l the per capita productt of h-ome industry in tbe Uniite(d
Kliingdomi at about $220, which would be increased to $2140 if we
include t-lie earni-ings of British investmiients in foreign-i countries.
rj1.'e wlhole of this product is, of course, not available for living
expenses. We must deduct the savings require(d for tl-he mnaintenance
an(l development of industry and such portion of taxes
as is not shifted to the consumner and tlhus incluidedI in living expenses.
Kiing estimnated the aninual savings in the United States
at two billions, using as a basis the increasc in the census figures
of wealth between 1900 and 1904, tbe,latest figures then available.
The fgures for 1912 showed that between 1904 anid 1912 the, increase
lhad been at the rate of four billionis. Dedtucting this sum
an(ld an allowance for taxes from the total would leave about 26
billions av(ailable for living expenses. This sum evenily distributed
with due allowance for age distribution, according to the scale
usually employed, wouild yield about $1300 for a famiiily of fathler,
mother, an(l three childrenl under fifteen years of age. According
to Chapin's estimate of 1907 it took $900 to provide for tlme physical
necessities of a lhealthful life for such a family in New York.
To quote bis exact words:
Tt s,'eems safc to conclusde from all the data we have been considerin(r
that an inicomie of under $800 is not enoighm to permit tlie mlaintenance
of a norimial standard. . . . An examination o-f the iteims of thie budget
sliows that the families laving from $900 to $1,000 a year are able, in


### ---Economics-1920-0-11.txt---
general, to get food enough to keep soul and body togetlier, and clotlhingr
tnd slhelter enouglh to iiect the mYlost urgcnt demands of decency.
Apparenitly even in the wealthiest country in the world the annual
product is not sufficient to providle nmore than a very moderate
surplus above whiat is required for the physical necessities of its
people as a wlhole.

According to King's estirnate there were in 1910 over nine million
families, excluding single individuals without dependents, with
incomes of less than $900, about one half of the total of such
families in the country. As already stated, the farmilies with incomes
in excess of $3,000 constitute(l not more than 4 per cent of
the total. From these families niust lhave come the major part of
the savings of the nation. If we lhald taken the whole surplus above
$3,000 froni these families, less their savings, and distributed it
among the poorest classes of the populationi, it might conceivably,
for the moment, haive es-tablished a minimum family income of
$1,000; but it is hardly necessary to argue that nio suclh radical
redistribution of income could be accomplished, eitlher througlh
taxation or an increase of wages at the expense of the other factors
of production without a falling off in production which would:
far exceed the sum distributed.
The production of a large portion of the income in excess of
$3,000 per family was undoubtedly due to the efficiency and savings
of those into whose hands it passed, Avas an essential factor
in stimulating their efficiency and savings, and could by no process
of reasoning be attributed to those among whom we have assume(
l it to be distributed.
I am, of course, aware tLat these figures do not apply today.
Not only have mioiney values doubled, but war lhas affected the
distribution of the national income probably to the advantage of
the well-to-do. Present condlitions are, however, abnormnal. The
war gave a treimen(lous stimulus to productive energy. We called
on h-itherto unused labor power an-d we worked overtime. Tr1here
is bound to be a reaction from. these concditions. It is still too
early to estimate wha-t the permanent eiect of the war will be,
but there can hardly be said to be as yet clear evidences of permanent
increase in per capita produiction.
I do not wislh to minimize the importance of the problem of distribution
or the evil of extrav.agant expeniditure. The smaller tlle
augregate inlcomile, the more im-1portant its equiL ble distribution
and the more reprehiensible extrava,iga,tnt and wastefuil expenditure.


### ---Economics-1920-0-12.txt---
It goes without saying that we should endeavor to cut off every
source of inconme wlhich corresponds to no benefits received by society,
being careful not to overlook the less obvious ways in which
benefit may be derived; but it is clear tlhat if the figures which I
have used at all approximate the truth the remedy for the unsatisfactory
conditions of life of the poorer portion of the population
of even the wealthiest countries must be chiefly sought, not in a
forced redistribution of national income but in the increase of their
marginal productivity, brouglht about by a diminution in their
number, relatively to the other factors of production, an increase
in their efficiency, and in a more intelligent use of the wealth
available.

In so far as a more equal distribution of income is effected by
methods, and the opportunities which it offers used in ways, which
increase the efficiency of those who benefit by it, without corresponding
loss of efficiency elsewh-iere, it is a distinct gain. Otherwise
it is merely a palliative, and, as the figures which I have used
indicate, a palliative of ciomparatively small potency. Palliatives
may be useful, even necessary, if they do not undermine the constitution,
but they are not a cure.
Our problem is not merely a problem in distribution. It is far
more extensive and fundamental. It is a great constructive problem
in social engineering, comprising many elements, and must be
attacked along manv lines of approaclh.
We may distinguish at least five phases.
1. The problem of individual efficiency. This is primarily a
problem of health and education in the broadest sense of the term,
involving not only our school system but the continuation of training
within the shlop and on the farm. Our industrial development
has been so rapid that our educational system has failed to keep
pace with it.

2. The problem of industrial organization of the readjustment
of our industrial mechanisnm in a manner to eliminate waste of
energy and goods, while preserving in their full strengtlh the motive
forces upon which economic progress (epends.
It is in connection with this element of the problem that the
economist canl render Iis greates-t service. The chief difficulty
which faces hiim is the incompleteness of his knowledge of the
actual working of the existing system. A vast inass of information
lhas been gathered in connection w^ith the administration of
our war activities. It is of tl-he first importance that this should


### ---Economics-1920-0-13.txt---
be made available and systematically utilized. In connection with
the administration of the income and excess profits taxes there is
also being gathered information which promises to be of great
value. But we must go farther than this. In co6peration with
the statistician we must work out a more adequate and better coordinated
statistical service, and those in whose hands lie the control
and direction of our industrial system must furnish much
more complete information concerning the operation and results
of the enterprise which they direct. We now require such information
based on prescribed and uniform systems of accounting
from certain enterprises regarded as quasi-public in character.
The field covered by such reports, as well as their scope, must be
gradually extended. Information regularly collected over a
series of years is far more valuable than that furnished by spasmodic
investigations of particular industries, conditions in which,
for one reason or another, attract public attention at the moment.
If there is one fact rather than another which the war has made
clear, it is the fact of the solidarity of our industrial system. Industry
has become socialized, not as the result of any conscious
purpose but by the working of economic forces. As it is organized
today, there is really no such thing as private industry in
the sense in which that term has been used in the past. What we
call private industry is privately managed public industry and
if that system is to endure those who hold positions of responsible
control must be willing to render a full and regular account
of their stewardship.
We need also special investigations which will be valuable in
proportion as they are scientifically conceived and carried out
and are directed to the solution of specific problems.


### ---Economics-1920-0-14.txt---
to command, again an educational problemi, and one of the greatest
(lifficulty.

The thiird phase of the problemn, that of securing lharmonious
and effective cooperation between the factors which make up the
individual industrial establishment, is, I take it, the constructive
aspect of what we term the labor problem.
The labor problem has in the past been commonly discussed as
a problem of distribution and of the control of the conditions under
which laborers work. The reasons why the problem has assumed
this form are evident. The industrial and legal system
which grew out of the Industrial Revolution place authority and
responsibility in the management of industry, and offer the reward
of success, to the entrepreneur class, closely associated with
the capitalist class. The laborer as a human being is left outside
the industrial sclheme. He has neither authority, responsibility,
nior hope of reward beyond his daily wage and the possibility,
open to very few, of escape from his class into the entrepreneur
class. With the rapid increase in the nurrmber of laborers made
possible by the increase in aggregate productive power, the increase
in the size of business units, the lack of continuity in employment,
due to the lack of adjustment in our industrial system,
and the necessity of making an immediate sale of his labor power,
the laborer has become as an individual ever more insignificant.
It is inevitable under these conditions that laborers should organize,
nlot as a constituent element witlhin the system, but for
the purpose of developing a figlhting power which shall enable
them to force from the system an increase in the price paid for
their services, a shortenincg of their hours of labor, and an improvernent
in the conditions under whichl they work.
That good h.as come from the increase or power which laborers
have secured through organization, that it has forced a more
equitable distribution of income than would otherwise have existed,
that it has improved the conditions under which the nasses of
men labor, that it has force(d more efficient methods of production
on the employer, and tlhat experience in the work of organization
and negotiation has exercised a valuable educational influence on
the laborer himself cannot be denied.
The fundamental weakness from the point of view of production
has, however, continued to exist. Those who control one of
the essential factors of production remain cutside the system as a
meclhaniism for the production of wealtlh, organized not for cooperation


### ---Economics-1920-0-15.txt---
in the increase of the commnron product but for the imiprovement
of their own condition regardless of or even at the expense
of such increase, for wlhiclh they feel no sense of responsibility.
Where harmony and cooperation are essential for production,
dislharmony and conflict prevail, a conflict which, with the
growing complexity of our industrial inechanism and the growing
strength of labor organizations, threatens the stability of our
whole economic system.
To state the case is to suggest the remedy. Laborers Imlust be
incorporated into the industrial scheme. They miust be given the
voice and responsibility in management, and the hope of reward
for successful effort, which they have h:itherto lacked. Harmony
between men engaged in a conmmon enterprise depends upon personal
contact and conference with full knowledge of the facts by
all concerned, a willingness to sacrifice momentary personal advantage
to the promotion of the common interest anid to submit
to discipline. Interest and a feeling of responsibility exist only
with a sense of power, of having a voice in the determination of
the methiods employed to bring ablout the rc-sult achieved.
These statements may indicate a very inadequate social psychology.
Our social psychlologists can fill out the picture anil
teaclh us the nature of the lhuman instincts with wllich we have to
deal. Our efficiency enigineers can instruct us in the methods of
the organization of work and the adjustmpent of earnings; but
they must study their problem from the point of view not merely
of profits but with consideration of the perinanent well-being and
harmony of interest of all concerned.
This incorporation of laborers must take place first in each industrial
unit. The laborer's sense of responsibility an(d interest,
if it is to be a vital force, must attach itself to tle establislhment
in which he works. There will always remain, however, questions
affecting wlhole branchles of industry whiclh must be settled by conference
between the representatives of the employers anld employees
in the industry as a whole, and questions affecting the relations
between different branches of industry calling for conference
between the representatives of these classes in the nation at large.
We accomplished much in the way of temporary adjustments
along these lines unrder the impulse of the war spirit. The peace
problemn is more difficult, but if our peace spirit is equal to our
war spirit it is not insoluble.
Laborers cannot be expected to give up the advan-tages of organization


### ---Economics-1920-0-16.txt---
and collective bargaining won tllrough long years of
struggle, but they inust be educated to realize that only through
cooperation with the employer in tbe increase of production can
laborers as a body acquire their maximumn earning power, that
any advantage obtained by a special group in the form of higher
wages accompanied by decreased per capita production and the
spreading out of work is obtained at the expense of the rest of the
community and is negatived by like succe-ss on the part of other
groups.

Employers cannot be expected to give up their responsibility for
management and the protection of the property interests which
they control, but they must be educated to realize the lesson emphasized
by the war, that there is really no such thing as private
industry, that, in the last analysis, they represent the nation and
that tlleir tenure depends upon their ability to organize effectively
the nation's productive resources and maintain harmonious relations
between those who must co6perate in industry. Success in
this task and not profits, except as they measure such success, is
the true measure of their efficiency. It would be foolish to begrudge
large rewards to those who succeed, but the task must be
performed or iother forms of industrial organization will be tried.
Until we can develop an intelligent public opinion on these fundamental
questions there is little hope of harmony in our industrial
life.

The alternative is a continuation of the struggle for control
which contains little iof promise. If we have erred in the past in
offering the laborer nothing but wages and giving him no voice
or responsibility in the organization and operation of the industry
in which he is engaged, there seems to be no reason to believe that
we should fare better if we put labor in absolute control, placing
capital and organizing and managing ability on a fixed stipend,
but denying them an effective voice in management and control.
I doubt whether human nature differs essentially as between economic
classes, whether we can expect better results from the dominance
of one class than of another, and whether we can eliminate
industrial conflict by eliminating the voice and the responsibility
of the capitalist and the entrepreneur in industry. The conflict
between classes would be replaced by struggle between different
groups of laborers. This struggle is suppressed while thle laborers
combine to fight the employer, but there is plenty of evidence
that it exists.


### ---Economics-1920-0-17.txt---
Nor does the success so far achieved in tlhe field of business administration
by officers directly or indirectly dependent upon
popular vote create confidence that such a change in the control
of industry would contribute to efficiency or progress. If one
party or the other must exercise exclusive control, the weight of
argument is in favor of the class which has a property interest at
stake.

In the past, progress in the field of politics and industry has
usually come through conflict of opposing interests. Are we yet
ready to substitute conference and cooperation in seeking the solution
which promrrises most for tlle common interests of all? It
seemed for a monient at the close of the war that we were, but recent
events can hardly be described as encouraging.
In an industrial society based on division of occupations, it is
impossible to secure harmony of immediate interests between economic
classes, whether seller and buyer, borrower and lender, or
employer and employee, just as it is impossible to secure harmony
of immediate interests between nations. Such harmony simply
does not exist. It is not impossible to secure a working basis for
cooperative action recognized by all concerned as based on reasonable
principles and promising to each better results in the long
run than could be obtained through conflict. All that is necessary
is a knowledge of the facts involved and the dominance of the
spirit of reason and far-sightedness.
There are many problems of great inmportance connected with
the coordination and smooth-working of cur extremely complex
economic system and with the distribution of its burdens and rewards,
but the fundamnental problem is still what it always has
been, the problem of increased per capita production and of the
rational and economical use of wealtlh, not a temporary increase
brought about uinder conditions which in the long run diminish
productive power and involve the sacrifice of tlhings more important
than wealth, but a permanent increase, resting on individual
efficiency, effective co6peration, and the adjustment of the number
of the population to the supply of natural resources upon
which it must in the last analysis subsist.

To fix the bearing of what I have to say, it is at the outset well to
make clear my point of view.
I believe that the democratic political movement in the civilized world
is likely to overbear all opposition: that the immediate political future
I hope, also, the ultimate political future is with democracy. Thus, I
am concerned to examine the terms on which the political democracy of
the future can be an enduring and a worth while thing.
I am, that is to say, convincedly-even, I suspect, dogmatically-a
democrat, in the sense that I believe thoroughly in popular government,
in the equality of individuals, in political rights and responsibilities, as
also in the high and substantive value of freedom in its own behalf. I
do not, however, ascribe to political freedom any essential sanctity of
ultimate or natural or inevitable rightness. I hold it, instead, to be an
issue of time and place and circumstance, as fit only for those people
that are fit for it. Democracy may easily approach to the worst of
all forms of government-in danger of being no government at all, but
mere license, disorder, revolution and counter-revolution-in the degree
that any people falls short of meeting its severe requirements. A
populace incapable of understanding its own needs, but attempting to
rule in its own interest, is almost certain to blunder into its own great
harm. It might better rely on such incidental welfare as may befall
from an intelligent and efficient government conducted primarily in another
interest. The present cult of democracy is undiscriminating.
But democracy at its credible best carries with it the highest assurance
of human welfare, precisely because it is the only government in which
the welfare of the governed becomes the direct and the ultimate problem
of the governors.

Political democracy is doubtless as readily possible in a collective as
in a competitive economic order; perhaps, indeed, is more easily possible,
in the sense of making call for a less vigilant intelligence. But I
amn not a socialist, if for no other or better reason than that I am un-
,able to make out what the socialistic ideal-the family writ large, the
brotherhood of man-would concretely turn out to be or do. I just


### ---Economics-1921-0-02.txt---
don't get it. But further I hold with the practical working necessity
of competition, and of competition within, as well as without, the economic
field-only that also I seem to myself to know that it is not all
wholesome, and that some of its unregulated workings are pernicious
and extremely dangerous, not merely 'directly to the general welfare
but to the very perpetuity of competitive institutions. A regulated
competition I take to be imperative, if competition is to be and to remain
a tolerable system. Successful competitive institutions, I hold,
require an intelligent guidance, which, so far, they have measurably
lacked, and in that lack have seriously and essentially suffered. The
most dangerous menace to the competitive order I take to be with those
partisans of it who resist iesolutely all change or amelioration of it.
There is a better service. Lowell, we recall, could best attest his love
of his country by his intense loathing of its shame. I hold, as for that
matter do also the Guild Socialists, that no system, tlloroughgoing and
systematically noncompetitive, could be tolerable at all. But the competitive
system needs to be made tolerable and, as I hold, can be made
tolerable, but not by the method of eliminating all coercive regulation
and restriction of it.
Essential, therefore, to the success of those voluntary co6perations
that are the characteristic traits of competition are the compulsory cooperations
that are in ultimate principle socialistic. Government, for
whatever there is of it, is so far an expression of the collective principle.
Believing, therefore, in the present order of society in its general
outlines, I believe also in the limited acceptance of the socialistic
principle. To get along without government-a systematic and unlimited
individualism, the competitive principle at its utmost extension
-I esteem as little as a government coercive over the entire economic
field, an unlimited and systematic collectivism.
So much as this, however, is obviously neither a radical nor a conservative
pronouncement. Instead, it is a mere commonplace of practical
policy. In the very institution of government the commonsense
of the world has recognized the necessity of limitations imposed on individual
activities, gain getting as well as other. Systematic laissez
faire is as thoroughly discredited as systematic collectivism ought to
be. The antithetical principles of liberty and of compulsion are good,
each in its own place and degree. The problem is one of articulation
and of adjustment between them. Wherever the ends or the methods of
individual striving conflict with the common good, there is the sphere of
the state, restrictive or coercive. Such is the plain meaning of the law
and order jurisdiction, the enforcement of contracts, the decree of
damages against torts, the enactment of pure-food laws, the license


### ---Economics-1921-0-03.txt---
or the regulation of products and of markets. When the individual
effort at gain appears to concur with the common good, as in the growing
of corn or the spinning of cotton-perhaps also in the culture of
silk and in the providing of champagne, face powder, and cigarettesthe
state may well keep hands off. All interference is a question of
expediency and not of ultimate ethical imperatives, a problem of the
costs and perplexities of the attempted control set over against the
putative good to be achieved. But government, the coercive control of
some things, is as necessary as are any of the things controlled. It is
only the anarchist that condemns all collectively coercive activities.
There is, then, as little validity in the wholesale denunciation of collectivism
as in the wholesale advocacy of it. The all-inclusive governmental
problem is to conform the working of individual activity to the
interests of the common welfare. For it is obvious that the sum of
individual welfares can report the sum of general welfare only so far
as the individual good is attained neither through parasitism nor predation.
A rational society will combine liberty and authority. Always
the problem is to draw lines of wise adjustment between the antithetical
principles. Subjected, then, to the test of the common good, neither
collectivism nor individualism can make its exclusive case. The proximate
ideal of society, perhaps also the ultimate ideal (about this last
I know something less even than I care) is that of individualism, collectively
controlled and supplemented-competition under collective
limitation. Never in society has there workably been, nor ever, as I
hold, will there wisely be, nor ever-in the absence of cataclysmic and
disastrous change-will there credibly be a systematic collectivism or
a systematic individualism or, for that matter, a systematic and logical
anything else. Under conditions of orderly and wholesome development,
systematic collectivism equally with systematic anarchism is a
dream of mad logicians. As well look for flourishing life under absolute
zero of cold or in unlimited heat. Societies are not thus monistic.
They are dualistic in principle of organization, precisely because they
are societies made up of individuals.
I protest then against the wastes of intellectual energy and of practical
effectiveness that attend the division of forward-looking men into
opposing doctrinaire schools of thought as to ultimate ideals in social
organization or as to the ultimate destination of society. I urge that
all constructive emphasis be centered on the near-by things. The thing
to do is always the next thing. It is a tragic waste of social forces to
divide on remote and rear-ground issues. The immediate problems are
difficult enough and are pressing. With the ameliorative program so
conceived and so limited, the agreements are vastly more important than


### ---Economics-1921-0-04.txt---
the differences. Only so can the next thinigs get done. Single-taxers
and socialists, for example, should postpone their issues of ultimate institutional
programs-their antithesis of individualistic as against collective
ethical presuppositions-so long as the doctrinal positions concur
in proscribing private property in natural bounty. Only when practical
policies diverge because of differences in theory are theoretical
dissensions to the purpose. When what to do is not at issue, it is folly
to fall to quarreling about why. The immediate problems of progress,
the policies common to programs ultimately divergent, are enough to
absorb all present attention and effort. So long as for every type of
progressive thought, a step is recognized as in the right direction, it is
mere blundering to complicate the case with the issues that can waitthat
as unactual are for the purposes unreal. Go along with your
neighbor till your paths diverge. To the socialist all merchandising
is parasitic. To me, these activities tend merely to proliferate into
extreme wastes. There should then be agreement on measures of limitation-
say, high license taxes. If actual taxation is working regressively
on private wealth and income, socialists and individualists may
unite in efforts toward a system less obnoxious to the ideals of both.
Higher inheritance taxes? Yes, say I, who, in order that the competitive
system may both endure and deserve to endure, would check economic
stratification, would hinder the emergence of differentials and
handicaps: if also the socialist says yes, as directed by his opposition
to private property in general, we can so far work together instead of
at cross purposes. Our differences are not actual. We desire the
same particular thing, the thing at hand, only for different ends.
Join we then to get the thing that we both now want. Later we may
contest in another field. Sufficient unto each day are the quarrels
thereof. I advocate progressive taxation in general in order to mitigate
the economic inequality that in my view is putting in hazard the political
and economic democracy of the competitive order. If to my socialistic
neighbor the same policy appeals as a step toward the abandonment
of the competitive order, it is still true that on either basis of
policy the thing is good. Our hopes diverge merely as to what will
come of it. I would have the officers of justice public functionaries,
and justice free not dear, and therefore only for the rich, and therefore
not justice-as also now I approve of free schools and free police
protection: and all of this not because I am a socialist but because I
am not; because, solicitous to preserve the competive order, I fear and
deplore its inadequacies and excesses. Some among all the things that
the socialist condemns I also condemn, but from the standpoint of another
ideal. Not in denying his criticisms where they are due, but in
admitting and then helping to remove them, is my best service to my


### ---Economics-1921-0-05.txt---
cause. That also the socialist wants these ameliorations because he is
a socialist, leaves it none the less true that he wants them. So far
we may work together. Because I desire equality in competition, I
want to be rid of property in privilege, in tolls, in restrictions of output,
in nostrums, in every ill good-will. With whomsoever also wants
to be rid of them I am glad to make common cause. I want a fair and
intelligent and adequate trial of the possibilities of competition for
human welfare, before the question of its abandonment for unknown
things is to attain the dignity of a present issue. Thus with another
man who takes these methods of amelioration of the existing order as
merely steps toward getting altogether rid of it, I have no present
quarrel. That he wants to improve it is enough for me, no matter what
may be his ultimate end. I also want to improve it-to the ultimate
end of preserving it. So improved, I hold it likely better to serve the
ends of human life than any new thing that he can offer as substitute
for it. My mistake? It may be. We shall see about it then. Meanwhile
now he is welcome to his own line of prophecy, as later, in its due
and appropriate time, he will be welcome to his own line of effort, divergent
from mine.

And now I arrive at positions perhaps more controversial. The society
to which as working ideal I pin my faith is a consistently democratic
society, a society of competitive equality; not, however, a society
of economic equality, so far as individual powers and accomplishment
must and will differ, but of inequality limited solely to differences
in individual ability and achievement; a society free of differentials of
privilege or of inherited opportunity; a society in which men may be
unequal solely by the title of individual gifts and accomplishment, but
equal still in all their objective conditions; a society of equality only
in the sense of equality of opportunity, where it can be only in the subjective
sense, never in the objective, that a man have no chance, that
he arrive in the world not less obviously damned into it than born into
it. And this means that a competitive society progressively stratifying
through the passing down from one generation to another of the differentials
inevitably emerging in each generation, I hold to be a society
that by the test both of its worth and of its promise of endurance
is grievously sick.

This credo, I admit, or that part of it that sounds in the ethical
emphasis, makes a not much better claim to validity than may attach
to any mere act of faith. Such with me in point of derivation it doubtless
was. I offer now no support of it; though, as ex post facto to its
getting, I think I have come into some reasons for holding it-considerations
of the aggregate serviceability of income, of competitive


### ---Economics-1921-0-06.txt---
consumption, of standards of living imposed by the haves that can and
pursued by the have-nots that can't; of the rainbow fading-out of
affirmative enjoyment into drab necessity; of the racial menace of declining
birth-rates; of the dreary futility and the spreading harm of
the decorative life for women-questions for the discussion of which
there is here no time.
All the more urgently, then, not as matter of inscrutable faith but
only of sheer factual outlook, I stress my assumiption that democracy is
coming. And, if so, I insist, economic institutions that shall make
room for it there must imperatively be, on penalty ultimately of a
fundamental reconstruction of society or of the debacle of civilization.
New social forces are preparing. With the man whose ideals of worth
incline to political or economic aristocracy I offer, I repeat, no confident
issue. His faith-just another faith it is-may be the right one
as to the organization of society which, if attainable and workably
enduring, would be best. It is doubtless arguable that with the intelligent,
according to the test of their own or their progenitor's success
in the pecuniary competition, shall wisely go the governing of
society, while the rest of us shall accept our welfare as an incidental
by-product of a government conducted by them in furtherance of their
own interests and purposes. But I judge that in any case this is not
to be. In this connection I note a recent declaration of faith by Mr.
Charles M. Schwab: "I am not a socialist. I believe in aristocracy;
but only because I believe that the aristocracy of this country is the
aristocracy of men and women who do things-the aristocracy of accomplishment.
" More important with me, however, than the faith that
the aristocratically competitive order ought not to be, is the factual
conviction that it canniot enduringly be, and that the effort to achieve
or to maintain it is fraught with great intermediate dangers and penalties.
I proceed on the frank assumption that, for better or for worse,
political democracy is to come, and that, as intelligently as may be,
place must be made for it.
But it is neither mere faith nor dogmatic prophecy to assert that
political and economic democracy cannot exist apart. It is a foolish
temerity and an improvident stupidity to attempt to articulate political
democracy with economic aristocracy. One or the other must in the
long reckoning perish. On the issues both of fact and of worth I am a
democrat in the economic sense because I am a democrat in the political
sense. I take it, therefore, that the modern world has to face the
question whether it will have political democracy under the competitive
order as over against some form of democratic collectivism. This issue
needs squarely to be faced. To plan for competition and for aristocracy


### ---Economics-1921-0-07.txt---
is to hazard both. I plead for radicalism to conservative ends,
for a progressive conservatism.
I hold it, therefore, to be our enduringly serious blunder in the conduct
of the great war that we failed to realize the long meanings of the
financial policies that we followed. We have now promptly to take account
of our newly emerging dangers. In point of degree the war has
vastly added to the perplexities of our institutional life by further solidifying
the economic stratification of society. The world has now to
reckon with 250 billions of war debts. The peace with Germany was
made to turn upon adding to its domestic war debt further billions of
debt to be externally held and collected. Consider the domestic debt
alone. These forty billions of war bonds are a promise that for an indefinite
future from the taxpayers of Germany the bondholders shall enjoy
a two billion dollar revenue. We did not substitute our own claims
for these but added ours to these-and all of this is our solicitude for the
domestic peace and the institutional democracy of Germany. Not only
do we leave it to the German taxpayers instead of to the malefactor
classes to provide our scant indemnity-and to our own taxpayers to
meet the deficit-but we allow to the malefactor classes two billion dollars
of annual revenues at the cost of their victim classes-enhanced
class wealth and enhanced mass poverty-not that we have so little
care but so little understanding of democracy and its needs. Even if
the rulers of Germany shall cease to plot wars, the peace which we leave
to the German people they cannot abide. For them it is an intolerable
poverty that has its cause and correlate in class wealth. Germany will
hardly win through to democracy excepting on terms of some sort of
repudiation; peaceable conceivably, disorderly probably, revolutionary
possibly. We have made no gift of democracy. Democracy is, I still
believe, to arrive in Europe, but only as the need and aspiration gain
the necessary strength to override the new barriers that the war has
erected and that the peace has reinforced.
I urge, in sum, that the present problem of the institutional conservative
is the establishment and the maintenance of economic democracy.
Failing of tlhis, we shall at the best provide solely the forms but never
the realities that are at the heart of democratic institutions. We shall
decline to the dangerous and temporary equilibrium of the servile state
-the aristocratic competitive order-to end either in a return finally
to the ways of equalitarian competition, or in social disintegration, or
in a drifting out upon the unplumbed, uncharted, and perhaps shoreless
seas of democratic socialisin. Or there is, it may be, one other way:
Guild Socialism may get a hearing, a captivating and not ineredible
compromise between the collective and the competitive principles,
equally unfittingly to be named either socialism or anarchism.


### ---Economics-1921-0-08.txt---
For those of us, therefore, who, convinced that democracy must
come, are glad to welcome it-who are not socialists, who instead regard
with favor the going institutions of working compromise between
the extremes of systematic anarchism and systematic collectivism, who
look ahead in limitless foreboding to the hazards and horrors of any
cataclysmic change, who have scant faith in the promise of any better
order into which these changes could finally lead-it is for us to ask
ourselves the terms on which the political democracy that is to come
can be harmonized with the competitive economic order. And thus,
once again, we return to examine what, in its economic aspect, the war
has meant, the problems which it has imposed, the solutions that it has
left possible. For we believe in political democracy as also we believe
in economic democracy, in the sense, be it repeated, that we hold neither
to be in essentials enduringly possible excepting in the presence of the
other.

It is now to be emphasized that the world war has not left the world
impoverished, for the sole reason that it could not. Wars are supported
out of current social product simply because they have to be.
It is present dearth as it is present death that war imposes. The poverty
of public debts is a fallacy, excepting in the purely separatist
sense that a national debt may be held by foreign creditors-the consumption
of the warring country supported out of the current supplies
of the creditor country. But just as in a national inventory of wealth
all domestic relations of debt and credit cancel out, so in a world accounting
all international debts must disappear.
In the main, these war debts are domestically held. And such part
of them as are held outside the country of their issue are held in the
allied countries. The present tragedy of want in Europe reports, for
the most part, not the impoverishment of resources by the war nor the
national indebtedness remaining over from it but only a paralysis of
current industry-a war legacy of disorder and disorganization, or
the dire gift of post-war diplomacy-new imperialisms, and continued
wars. It is not chiefly by the depletion of capital funds but by the
interruption of income flow that Europe lacks for supplies, precisely
as in the war years it was not out of capital resources but out of current
production that the war was supported.
No? But it has become as commonplace as self-evident that no
future item of product can function as supply for either the civilian
or the military needs of any warring country. Neither war loans, nor
war taxes, nor any other loan or tax, can make possible the present
consumption of a prospective product. Old Sir Thomas Browne saw
this truth clearly: "He had caught a great cold had he no other clothes


### ---Economics-1921-0-09.txt---
to wear than the skin of a bear not yet killed." An exterior loan
merely places a warring nation in control of exterior current products,
through the promise of a later and offsetting return of the products
of a later time. Domestic loans control only domestic goods of current
supply. Like taxes, loans distribute purchasing power over current
goods in favor of the government; but, unlike taxes, they provide
for a later redistribution of the goods that the future will produce.
Loans and taxes differ not at all in point of the current national resources
out of which the support of the war must be provided. The
differences attach solely to later accountings of principal and interest
to creditors, creditors who might instead have been taxpayers. Equally,
whether by loans or taxes, subtractions from current individual incomes
there must inevitably be, so far as war is to be supported at
all. Whoever can buy bonds can pay taxes. The taxes terminate in
slips of paper that are receipts, the loans provide slips of paper that
are the beginnings of other things-contractual slips of paper, promising
redistributions of future incomes and secured by first liens against
these future incomes. But the future incomes do not thereby become
presently available for present needs. The bonds induce the voluntary
grant of present income. Taxes get the same results coercively out of
the same resources of present goods. Distinctions of equity, tactical
expediency, admrinistrative complexity, class pressure, and general intelligibility
are another matter. Doubtless the opposition to war is
less if profits to many and costs to none are in general expectation.
Equally, for the most part, is war support impossible out of wealth
remaining over from the past. Most of it-houses, lands, factories,
equipment, furniture-is unavailable for present consumption either
civilian or miilitary; it is goods serving as intermediates toward product
but themselves not final products for consumption. Stored up
war supplies-munitions, equipment, war bread-are doubtless possible,
but only in relatively meager volumes. Something also is possible, so
far as deterioration can practically be carried, in making past production
directly tributary to present emergencies. So again, goods for
civilian consumption may not merely be economized-consumption restricted-
but can be worn out without current replacement, whereby
productive forces may be so far set free for military purposes. But
the sum of all of these levies on the past bulks small in relation to the
total war requirement. In the large it still holds true that present war,
like present peace, must pay its way as it goes.
The irrelevancy of bullion supplies, of banking reserves, and of facilities
for currency expansion-or the worse than irrelevancy-is thus
evident, so far as the fundamentals of war finance are concerned. Wars
are questions of those margins of productive energy and output that


### ---Economics-1921-0-10.txt---
are left available for military purposes, after civilian consumption is
provided for. Governmental outpourings of clipped coin or of paper
money are long-discredited fallacies. But equally also was our vaunted
preparedness in gold reserves for credit expansion a mere preparedness
for inflation. The realities in the situation these influences barely
brush. Easy credit is not easy or plentiful product. New dollars will
not clothe or feed men. More of the dollars is not more ships, cannon,
ammunition, or more men to be spared from industry for the camps
and the firing lines, or for supplying military goods to the embattled
men. As armies march on their stomachs, so wars proceed on something
more substantial than mere necromancy- on a more effective
provisionment than the present shadows of coming things-not on the
present worth of no matter how credible promises, secured never so
well against incomes which as yet are not. Social unrealities a plenty
there are in competitive individual wealth. But the actualities of war
leave no place for intangible assets. True it is that one may sell his
individual wealth and buy bonds. But not all may sell to one another
to the result that all may buy bonds. And even if they could the supplies
to be purchased would be no whit the greater.
Our credit devices of war finance, whether wise or unwise by the test
of their total effects, and whether just or unjust by the test of the
ultimate distribution of burdens, were processes that for every strictly
war purpose moved merely upon the surface of things. For a people
like ours that must provision and munition its own war-to say nothing
of financing its associates-the essentials of success lay in the current
productive efficiency of its industry, as supplemented by the most rigorous
economy in civilian consumption-the utmost speeding up of the
one, the utmost practicable retardation of the other. The past but
little and the future not at all could serve for the purpose. At the
best, the financial processes were merely devices of guidance and adj
ustment.

Certain other issues become equally clear. The choice of financial
policies lay not between taxes or loans on the one side as over against
credit inflation on the other. It was between taxes and inflation.
Taxes from ultimate income and loans from ultimate income are doubtless
indistinguishable in certain of their effects. If only the funds are
secured out of ultimate incomes, it need not matter that the scrap of
paper that is a contract one may use as collateral for borrowing and
that the scrap of paper that is a receipt one can not. The bonds that
so readily lend themselves to inflation need not of strict necessity be so
used. The banks might be led to refrain from carrying the paper, or
could have been prohibited, or might have been subjected to such reserve


### ---Economics-1921-0-11.txt---
requirements as to have lacked the disposition-measurably difficult
expedients, doubtless, all of them. But the decisive fact is that no
ultimate income borrowing could have been made to suffice for the need.
For a great war this method will not serve. No credible rate of interest
will attract the necessary degree of sacrifice, imposing sufficiently
drastic subtractions from individual incomes and the necessary restriction
of individual consumption. This can be accomplished, not by the
methods that work through inducement, but only by the taxes that leave
no choice. Nor could any rate of interest seriously effective in this
connection have avoided so drastic recapitalizations of property and
security values as to precipitate a financial hurricane. And correlative
bank rates must have been maintained, or directly or indirectly the
banks would have absorbed, on inflation terms, the issues of bonds. If
we were to rely on gigantic borrowing for war funds, we had to follow
the inflation method. Taxation was the sole alternative.
Doubtless it must be admitted that drastic taxation-there was no
escape from something drastic excepting in a small war-carries with
it dangers similar to those of high interest borrowing, but only in
minor degree. With narrowing residual incomes, some holders of securities
and other properties will be pressed to sell to get free funds.
Interest rates must advance appreciably, but not at all in the degree
attending the loan process-precisely because the necessary restrictions
of civilian consumption are left not to choice under the inducement of
higher interest rates but instead to the coercion of taxes. It is in
favor of taxes also that when one pays the tax he knows that he is so
far the poorer. The buyer of bonds feels himself an investor, as
actually he is. Bonds placed with banks or carried by them for buyers
bring inflation, huge and swollen national debts, future taxes, inflation-
swollen, upward shifting prices-and therewith such increased
civilian economy as rising prices on the one side may afford as against
rising profits on the other. Borrowing from ultimate incomes, in the
degree of its possibility, brings only a slight inflation, no appreciable
upward shift of general prices, future taxes, economy of civilian consumption,
sharp advances in interest rates, and a disastrous readjustment
in property and security values. Taxation brings an even less
appreciable inflation, a closer approximation to stability in prices, a
more marked economy in civilian consumption, relatively slight changes
in interest rates, and a relative immunity from financial disturbance.
Had America followed the English rates of taxation, it need not, I believe,
have resorted to either type of borrowing.
And here the analysis returns to my main point of emphasis. Taxes
avoid bonds. Because the war was financed in the main by the inflating


### ---Economics-1921-0-12.txt---
bond-credit method, the world faces a situation altogether new in its
seriousness.

It is, in strictness, no part of my problem to; appraise the weight
of the war costs that somehow we carried and somehow had to carry.
If, relatively to our carrying ability, these were so light that noninflation
methods of loan finance could have served, so also the alternative
taxes could have been light. Modern war, waged even in a nearby
field, requires for each soldier in the ranks two tributary civilian workers.
Our three and one half millions of men, allowing for their transport
requirements, called for eight or more millions of tributary producers.
The bread-winners of the country numbered approximately
forty millions, many of these, however, not socially productive. The
less than thirty remaining millions had to make good these withdrawals
of men and to supply the soldiers and tributary workers with their
quotas of goods of ordinary civilian requirement. I take five million
of combatants to have been the limit of our utmost possible contribution
to the war. As it was, our supplies ran continuously short of our
commitments-warships, freighters, transports, submarines, airplanes,
cannon, machine guns, small arms, ammunition, blankets. It was things
that were lacking for our war funds to buy.
Whoever holds then, as I do not, that our per capita product of
civilian goods for civilian consumption was maintained in the war years,
proclaims merely, and as I think exaggerates, the ineptitude of America'
s economic participation in the war. Even if, in the speeding-up
aspect, our war record was all that is claimed for it as offsetting the
enormous war absorptions of men and of products, the record would
remain still profoundly humiliating. We came perilously near to losing
the war. It is only in the degree of possible civilian economies
that, in the main, war is now and always has been possible. Both the
magnitude and the methods of modern warfare are solely explicable
through the increasing margins of product available, above civilian requirements,
for the things of war. In the progress of the industrial
arts, therefore, are the explanations for the surpassing size, the surpassing
expensiveness, and the surpassing horrors of modern war. So
far, then, as the wisdom and spirit of peace lag behind industrial
progress, the primitive man may easily have been the more fortunate
man-our tree of knowledge heavy with bitter fruit.
In some sense it is beside my point, also, to stress further the fact,
that those inflation methods have vastly swollen the monetary statement
of the national debts. But in this fact is the decisive argument
against deflation. The bond issues have mortgaged our monetary policies.
The governments of the world are near enough to fiscal insolvency


### ---Economics-1921-0-13.txt---
already-not, however, I repeat, to national insolvency. The injustices
also are great enough, with tle debts restricted to their present
burden. The men who forfeited positions and earning power to face
the chances of death have enough to pay if, winning out to return at
all, they repay to us stay-at-homes in cheap dollars the cheap dollars
that we advanced as support of their dangerous adventure. And on
these terms also their children and their children's children will have
enough to pay to ours.
Conceivably, I admit, it might be good ethics-if only also it were
possible-that future generations should share with the present generation
the costs of a war that, in no small part, will enure to the future
advantage, even though it be also probable that these coming generations
will have their own wars to fight-and, it may be, the more of
them to fight by the very fact that, vastly increased in numbers, they
must find their living in a world grievously impoverished by our own
excesses and prodigalities. But this thing-take it to be never so
just-cannot be. In that future time this present generation will rank
as a past generation. Dead and departed, it can have no payments
made to it. No payments can ever be made by one generation but to
itself. It will be only the grandchildren of some of us that will get paid
at the cost of the grandchildren of others of us. Solely in the sense
of this redistributive bearing on the future, can burdens be passed on.
So fatr, truly, as the benefits of the war are enduring, there is a gift
by us to the future-but a gift in its nature common to the children
of all of us. But for some of these children the gift is to take on also
the quality of a pecuniary asset. The other children will pay these
first for the gift provided for all. Wisely, then, these inheritors of
debt in favor of correlatively inheriting creditor grandchildren will
adapt to their own case Lloyd-George's challenge of the British land
system: "Why are fifty millions of us Englishmen trespassers in the
land of our birth?"

Nor is this all of the truth. In large part the bonds were purchased
out of inflation-awarded margins of profit. The masses who
paid once in the form of these margins the money by which the profitmakers
bought the bonds will later pay in taxes the cash to meet the
accruing interest charges and finally also to retire the bonds.
I am not concerned to join issue with anyone on the quiestion of the
practical inevitability of these enormous national debts. I admit that,
in the lack of any general understanding of their ultimate meanings
and their long effects, in the easy and improvident opportunism of
political life, and in the want of wisely brave leadership, nothing else
was credibly possible. I charge no faults of purpose anywhere. But
that the wealth of the country would not have borne whatever share of


### ---Economics-1921-0-14.txt---
the general burden it could recognize as its duty I do not believe. Had
the social necessity and the personal and institutional justice of the
conscription of current income been understood-the conscription of
wealth was nonsense-I believe that the war idealism of America would
have accepted the taxes as contentedly as it accepted the selective
draft. The truth is merely that we didn't know. We had not thought
it out. The fundamentals of war finance were, even to the economists,
an unknown field. We had busied ourselves with other things-the
processes and the problems of peace. Thus by error and drift we allowed
our war for political democracy to go far toward making democracy
impossible, carrying us thus dangerously forth in the direction
of those economic institutions in which political democracy cannot
thrive. We have blundered into our almost irremediable harm. We
have mortgaged our political institutions, and therewith have hazarded
either the perpetuity or the worth not only of these but of the competitive
economic order. Both must be democratic if they are to deserve
to endure, probably also if they are actually to endure.
But most of the evil effects of the war, as also some of the good,
will pass with the lapsing years. The international bitterness will disappear,
even if to the sole end of making place for others. The injustices,
the hardships, the suspicions, and the protests attending the
inflation process will fall out of recollection. The earth scars will
grow green with the changes of new springs. The war dead passed
promptly out of the domain of our problems. The war-maimed and
the war-invalided will early arrive at their infallible ways of cure. Time
will shortly have assuaged the pangs and stilled the sobs of bereavement;
or, if there come no earlier surcease, to these pangs the sun and
the rain will offer solace and these sobs the grass will muffle, the things
of yesterday ranking with all the other tales that are told-the done
and gone no part of that human experience to which the current life
is grianting its new meed of happy living.
But still not all things pass. These institutional effects of the war
in the stratification of wealth will remain with us. To these nightmare
debts no similar principle of passage or of mortality attaches. Their
life stretches indefinitely beyond the individual life, to match it, it may
be the span of racial o,r institutional duration. But surely, as I hold,
from this long-enduring body of death, the democracy of the future will
greatly stir to shake itself free. I believe also that it will succeed,
and will succeed within the limits of the orderly development of competitive
institutions. But I hold that, failing of the wisdom or the
determination for this effort, and acquiescing in this burden of debt,
democracy cannot remain democracy.


### ---Economics-1921-0-15.txt---
But, after all, how, within the present institutional situation, with its
actual distribution of leverage and power, shall the democraticallyminded
masses hope for success? Revolutionary thinkers declare it to
be impossible, consistently with the orderly processes of political development.
My belief-my faith, if you please-is other. I hold
that it is precisely through the progressive understanding and the enlightened
decision of the classes with which this power land leverage
lic-through their growing recognition of the ways of wisdom, of obligation,
of provident adjustment and of sagacious coiiperation-that
the thing will come. And if it does not so come, it will be solely that
the wisdom has been lacking to face fairly what the alternative will
mean. Now, as always in soci-al problems, the primary need is to
understand.

The first task, then, of political and economic sagacity I take to be
the retirement of these debts-through the assertion of the claim to
all further emerging increments upon the social estates, through income
and inheritance taxes, through severely high excises on middlemen
activities, and even, if need were, as in Europe need actually is,
through capital levies. If we allow the evils resulting from the war to
run on, unmitigated, the consequences in social unrest, in lowered labor
morale, in extravagant and destructive radicalism, in riot and, it may
be, in attempted revolution, will cost us-and will cost all of usvastly
more than a courageous and even heroic settlement of our problems
now with the means at hand. Always and everywhere it is for each
present generation to protect rather than to impair the resources of
the coming generations and to foster rather than to mar their liberties.

### ---Economics-1922-0-01.txt---
The historian of another age is likely to appraise our own day as
d;sturbed in thought, no less than restless in action. The shock of
the Great War brought mental bewilderment with dislocated affairs.
Accepted creeds were challenged as smug conventions, and primary
faiths-wrenched from traditional security-groped for firm stands.
Theology, politics, philosophy, economics, felt this upheaval. Like
Serapion, the pious believer lamented the old anchorage and cried for
a new god.

It was the basic social concept-the trend of human affairs-that
suffered most. Seven years ago the doctrine of progress might have
been fairly described as a scientific verity. Barring the pessimism of
a philosophical cult, the receding postulates of Marxism and the occasional
rationalist crying in the wilderness, there was no formal dissent
from the principle of progressive betterment in human affairs. The
pendulum was to swing far. In 1919 a regius professor of history,
in the detachment of doctrinal review could declare:2 "The progress
of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal
immortality. It is true or false, and like them it cannot be
proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith."
From this frank agnosticism there developed two variants. The
one, an extreme rebound from implicit acceptance, was naturally
enlough sheer negation. Not progress but blind chance-even worse,
outright retrogression-is the order of social movement. A century
and a half ago, Adam Smith-as after him, the whole train of classical
economists through John Stuart Mill-had indeed fashioned the concept
of a retrograde as against a progressive or a stationary society.
But the blight was specific and remediable: "the sensible decay" of
"the revenue and stock of its inhabitants" making up "the funds
destined for the maintenance of labor."3 The older economics, any
more than the older philosophy, had no place for a necessitarian
doctrine of social decline.
War oave way to Reconstruction, and the menace of arms yielded


### ---Economics-1922-0-02.txt---
to the dislocation of peace. With the change, philosophical depression
was succeeded by historical retrospect. The sensible form became
a revival of the age-old concept of cyclical return. Less naive than the
Stoic's doctrine of periodic destructions and rebirths, more complex
than Vico's principle of reflux, less mystic than Nietzsche's vision of
eternal recurrence-the essence of this new creed is that the course
of human affairs follows not a trajectory but a spiral.
The composite origin of the doctrine appears in its two phases: the
spiral may be horizontal or vertical. The one, with ear-mark of reaction,
assumes a recurrent swing bringing man back again and again
to the point from which he started; the other, still linked with the
old optimism, pictures a spiral ascent, wherein "each stage of an
upward progress corresponds in certain general aspects to a stage
which has already been traversed."4 Both are insistent that normal
forces working in essentially like settings beget similar phenomena.
Color and warmth have been lent to this "neo-spiralism" by historic
parallel. In particular, the accompaniments and sequels of the other
4"great war" of a hundred years ago disclose resemblances so startling
that a recent investigator observes: "A student conversant with the
earlier period often has an uncanny feeling of having previously lived
through current events."5 In currency disorders, in price fluctuations,
in industrial disputes, in agricultural unrest, in trade depression, in
social reaction-this likeness appears: "Everything goes, everything
returns, eternally does the wheel of being roll."6
The parallelism in economic facts has been at least partially explored;
but the likeness in economic thought has received little attention.
Invoking the principle of historical relativity, an exhibit of
resemblance might be expected. Opinion is an interpretation of life.
Given corresponding conditions, like doctrines may be anticipateddiffering
only as the personal equation shades the image or as new
instruments of precision render it more exact.
The role of the political economist in the Napoleonic contest and its
aftermath was not influential, certainly not distinguished. Adam
Smith's death three years before the outbreak of hostilities had made
"4less impression than the death of a bustling divine." The public regarded
the Theory of Moral Sentiments as "a far superior work" to
the Wealth of Nations, and calmly accepted the latter as "a sensible
book."7


### ---Economics-1922-0-03.txt---
A decade before, indeed, tradition has it that Pitt had come under
Smith's influence, and thereafter "always confessed himself as one of
Smith's most convinced disciples."' Mr. Rae has written of the young
statesman "reforming the national finances with the Wealth of Nations
in his hand," and Buckle long ago cited Pulteney's appeal to "the
authority of Dr. Smith who, it was well said, would persuade the
present generation, and govern the next."' But recent studies have
tended to qualify this wholesale ascription. Rose insists that the influence
of Adam Smith upon Pitt has been exaggerated ;" Rees maintains
that even in his administrative reforms Pitt was influenced "less
by Adam Smith than by the Committee of Public Accounts (of 1785),""
and Kennedy, contesting the view that the Wealth of Nations brought
to the world a new revelation of the principles of taxation, declares
bluntly that Smith merely "gave a wide intellectual sanction to a set
of opinions already very influential" and that "all the large changes
(in taxation) since his day.... have been made independently, or in
spite of the influence of his ideas."'"
Certainly, with the alarms of war, economic philosophy yielded to
economic opportunism. From 1793 on, through Pitt's death in 1806,
up to the end of the great struggle, the impress of Adam Smithwhatever
it mav have been-was felt in the world of thought, not in
the domain of affairs.
Adam Smith's mantle descended upon Dugald Stewart. But with it
came no direct access of practical influence. Reaction, born of the
Terror, was in the air; and, discriminating critic and eloquent expositor
though he might be, Stewart was not temperamentally of the
stuff of academic martyrs. "I have been so uniformly impressed with
a sense of the importance of my situation" (as professor of moral
philosophy at Edinburgh)-he wrote in apologetic reply to Lord
Abercromby's alarm-"that among all the interesting questions which
have, during the last nine years, divided our political parties, I have
never introduced the slightest reference to any of them excepting in
the single instance of the African trade, on which I formerly expressed
myself with some warmth ;-and even these expressions I dropped from
my course, as soon as it became matter of public discussion.,',
Apart from Adam Smith and Dugald Stewart we search vainly in the
period before 1800 for any considerable influence of economic opinion


### ---Economics-1922-0-04.txt---
upon public policies. Massie, never widely read, had long since been
forgotten. Hume's Political Discourses had, a generation before, entered
into the general equipment of the publicist and become mere
common sense. Sir James Stewart's stately volumes gathered dust
on the shelves. Godwin's Political Justice-destined to exercise a profound
impress upon a succeeding generation-was accorded the neglect
which Pitt observed could be safely imputed a work that sold
for three guineas. Bentham, writing from the first-in Dumont's
phrase "never as the historian but alwavs as the legislator,"-had
shown his mettle, but hardly more. The Essay on the Principle of
Population, two years after its publication, was still a sacrilegious
lampoon for which its anonymous author, one Rev. Thomas Robert
Malthus, should have been unfrocked.
There was, as there had been for a century earlier, a succession of
economic compositions-some not without practical result. Young,
Sinclair and Anderson made themselves felt in agricultural policies.
Eden contributed to clearer thinking as to social conditions. Richard
Price could point to the sinking fund with something akin to proprietary
interest. Yet the first decade of the Napoleonic struggle ended
with the economist, as such, neither prominent nor important.
The turn came in the second half of the war with the increasing
acuteness of economic disorders and the greater interest in economic
study. The Bank Restriction of 1798 and the ensuing derangement
of the exchanges brought forth a flood of pamphlets in polemic criticism
and defense, culminating in the Bullion Report and in Ricardo's
definitive tracts. The price of corn fluctuated wildly with the interruptions
of war-intensifying crop variations-and an 'inquiry into
the causes and remedies of the late and present scarcity and high price
of provisions" became a literary habit. Pitt's fiscal necessities and the
reluctant adoption of the income tax in 1799 precipitated a controversial
war. Malthus took formal place as the best abused man of his
day. The Berlin and Milan decrees revived, in new phase, an old
discussion as to commerce and national well-being. The sinking fund
was alternately magnified as a fiscal panacea and reviled as a national
calamitv.

Substantial as was this body of economic writing it lacked continuity
and integration. Like the currency debate of the seventeenth
century and the trade controversy of the eighteenth, pre-Ricardian
literature of the nineteenth century figures, with bare exceptions, as the
output of tract-writers and pamphleteers.
The saving elements were the concurrent growth of scientific consciousness
and the vogue of economic study-tendencies associated
with the name of Dugald Stewart. Unimportant in doctrinal contribution,


### ---Economics-1922-0-05.txt---
negligible in practical influence, the notable service of Stewart
was in preserving the concept of economic science and in transmitting
an ardent enthusiasm for its pursuit.
The small groups who from 1799 on gathered at Edinburgh in
attendance upon his "separate course"-James Mill, J. R. McCulloch,
Thomas Chalmers, the Earl of Lauderdale, Henry Brougham, Francis
Horner, Francis Jeffrey, Macvey Napier, Sydney Smith, Archibald
Alison-were the men who contributed most as text-writers, as reviewers
and as journalists to the revival of economic study in England in the
decade then beginning.
But the largest product of Dugald Stewart's lecture room was the
prominence of economic criticism in the newly founded Edinburgh
Review. The project was from the first designed to effect practical
reform rather than to afford philosophical exercise. Undertaking to
oppose in politics, in economics, and in jurisprudence that "timorous
acquiescence in the actual system," which Walter Bagehot calls a habit
of the early nineteenth century, the Review became something more
than "the doctrinal organ of the whigs." In the field of economic
relations, its editors attempted nothing less than the formation and
spread of a sound public opinion. Issue after issue appearing with
essay-like critiques from Francis Horner, Richard Jeffrey, Sydney
Smith, Henry Brougham-a little later Malthus, James Mill, and
McCulloch-the Review became the rostrum from which olympian
judgment, sometimes biased, often truculent but rarely incompetent,
appraised the economic writings and happenings of the period.
From the new consciousness proceeded scientific dignity and popular
interest. Adam Smith had used the term the "science" of political
economy and in the next generation, thanks to Stewart's teaching and
Say's writing, the phrase had come into easy use. But from 1810
on it acquired meaning and force. The fourth edition of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica in that very year carried an expository article on
"Political Economy." A coterie gathered about Ricardo's breakfast
table, and personal regard cemented intellectual sympathy. Doctrinal
controversies were initiated and conducted with spirit-a remarkable
exhibit of this activity, the long missing and much desired manuscript
of Ricardo's Notes on Malthus having happily been recovered during
the past summer and being now in process of publication.1"
Academic recognition, anticipated in Malthus' appointment at
Haileybury in 1807, was more fully accorded by Pryme's lectureship at
Cambridge in 1816 "to facilitate the study of a science hitherto inaccessible
without the most arduous perseverance," even though subject to
the condition, indeed, that the lectures be not given at an earlier hour


### ---Economics-1922-0-06.txt---
than twelve o'clock, lest they should interfere with other fixtures.15
Finally, in 1821, the Political Economy Club-to whose honored centenary
this Association within the last month has sent its message of
congratulation-was organized nominally to support the Merchants'
Free Trade Petition of 1820, but really, as its first resolutions set
forth, to effect the formation of a society for promoting the knowledge
of political economy. l
The counterpart of scientific consciousness was popular vogue. In
1811, Boileau compiled his Introduction to the Study of Political
Economy "particularly for those to whom rank or fortune hold out
the noble prospect of being one day called to legislate for their fellowsubjects.
"'7 At the other extreme Mrs. Marcet, a few years later, presented
her Conversations in Political Economy-destined to run
through many editions-in order to bring the science within the reach
of any "intelligent young person, fluctuating between the impulse of
her heart and the progress of her reason, and naturally imbued with
all the prejudices and popular feelings of uninformed benevolence."18
Maria Edgeworth recorded in 1823 that political economy was
displacing the ordinary disciplines as the necessary equipment of
nursery governesses and that "it had become high fashion with blue
ladies to make a great jabbering on the subject."19 In 1823 McCulloch
trumpeted: "The time cannot be far distant when a knowledge, or at
least some little attention to, Political Economy will be considered as
necessary for a legislator as a knowledge of Greek"-in itself no mean
exhibit of the economist's spiral.20 And almost at the same time an
anonymous author presented "to the enlightened ideas, and acute perception
of the American people" A Treatise of Political Economy.....
in the form of a Romaunt, for the more pleasing accommodation of
readers; wherein the subject "presumed to be considered upon strict
philosophical, mathematical, and geometrical principles" is explained
in a series of letters to Aristippus from Aristander, "perceived in a deep
vision."'

The reflex of scientific pursuit and popular favor was practical
effect. In the five years that followed Waterloo-roughly, the period
of post-bellum reconstruction-political economy exercised a practical
influence never before equalled. In every phase of the nation's life
there was enactment or repeal in accord with "the verdict of the econAAutobiographic
Recollections of George Pryme (1870), p. 121.


### ---Economics-1922-0-07.txt---
omiists"-sometimes even in vindication of rejected advocacies. The
income tax which in 1798 Pitt had imposed and in 1803 reimposed
was in 1816 repealed and the very assessment records burned. The
sinking fund after two decades of financial legerdemain was reconsidered
in 1819 and reconstituted in 1823. The House of Coinmons
in 1811 solemnly recorded its dissent from the conclusions of the
Bullion Report, only with equal solemnity in 1819 to reverse its action.
Tooke's draft of the Merchants' Petition, favorably received by Lord
Liverpool's government in 1820, established the political rallying point
for "the principles of a Free Trade policy" which a generation before
Adam Smith had regarded "as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or
Utopia should ever be established" in Great Britain.
How from this high estate, political economy in the next decade fell
to disregard and neglect is a familiar but painful chapter in the history
of our science. Inquiry gave way to dogmatism and analysis was
displaced by disputation. Intellectual independence was sapped and
scientific doctrine degenerated into barren dialectics, even into class
advocacy. Cobbett, Place, Owen and the sturdy group lately come
into its own as the "English Socialist School"-exposed "the inherent
defects and injustice of the existing system." Mallet could write of
accuracy and minuteness of definition as part of "the coxcombry of
the Political Economists". . . .continuing thereafter, in Elia's phrases,
"their minds are never caught in undress or by glimpses; their stocks
of ideas are in perfect order and completeness. You cannot cry halves
to anything they find. Between the affirmative and negative there is
no border land with them. Their conversation is a book."22
It was before this august company that McCulloch could assert
"that there could not be a farthing more capital in the country if the
national debt had not been incurred" 23 that Tooke could propose "tea
as a perfect object of taxation, because it would hardly be considered
as a necessary of life, and the quantity required by each individual is so
small";24 that Senior could maintain in opposition to the Factory bill
of 1837 that the profits of the operators accrued only in the final hour,
and that "the Factory bill was altogether mischievous.,25
The influence extended beyond "The Caledonians." In 1833 Harriet
Martineau assured early Victorianism that "The case of those wretched
factory children seems desperate; the only hope seems to be that the
race will die in two or three generations, by which time machinery may


### ---Economics-1922-0-08.txt---
be found to do their work better than their miserable selves."26 And
James Stirling-one of "the popular advisers of the middle class"-
writing a little later but reflecting a like spirit, could look forward
to a time when "the fanatical faith of the working classes in the
artificial mechanism of combination will give place to trust in the wiser,
because more natural, system of individual competition; and the hiring
of labor, like the exchange of commodities, will be set free, to be regulated
by the Heaven-ordained laws of Supply and Demand."2"
II

Let us turn from this century-old story to consider the role of the
economist-of the American economist-in our own Great War, and in
its aftermath. The first fact to arrest attention is the deeper consciousness,
the more articulate form, the larger recruitment of the science.
In 1917 political economy in the United States could fairly rank with
any of its sister sciences in the definiteness of its aim, in the detail of
its exposition, in the range of its influence, in the ardor of its devotees.
In outright numbers and in relative competence the fraternity had
made notable advance. Compactly organized in scientific association,
supplied as to assembled material and equipped as to technical journals,
animated with high sense of public responsibility, established in
academic office with large student groups affording apprentices and
offering discipleship-the economist had come to fill a distinctive place
in the nation's life. Increasing requisition by public service and sensational
bidding-up by private enterprise had so far dissipated the old
seclusion that prospective scientific impoverishment rather than present
public neglect constituted his concern. Witlh the greater specialization
of social effort nation, state, and city were utilizing the economist'
s counsel and enlisting his personnel. In Washington this was
physically mnanifest. The Cosmos Club, like Piccadilly Circus, was
the point at which one might stand and see his world pass.
The permanent Census Office, the reconstituted Department of
Labor, the rehabilitated Tariff Commission, the enlarged Department
of Commerce, the reorganized Federal Trade Commssion, the expanding
Department of Agriculture were so many stages in the economist's
progress. Not always as expertly staffed as might be, hampered often
by political exigency, they reflected a widening infiltration. There
were positive triumphs too. Workmen's compensation had become a


### ---Economics-1922-0-09.txt---
part of our industrial scheme. Mediation and arbitration were finding
use in systematized form. Collective bargaining, at least as a phrase,
had entered into business terminology. The income tax had been incorporated
into the national revenue system. The theory of monopoly
price was definitely accepted as to the regulation of non-competitive
industry. The Federal Reserve act had repaired the glaring defects
in our banking organization. The Federal Farm Loan project gave
assurance that agricultural credit was to become available.
At our entry into the war the opportunity would thus seein to have
been present for the exercise of a large influence upon affairs. The
course of the struggle had made it evident that eventually the race
must be to the economically strongest; and the experiences of the
belligerents had shown the penalty of economic bungling.
In the physical sciences there was swift mobilization and quick tender
and ready acceptance of scientific guidance. As to the economists
there is a different story. There had been no preparedness in the three
fateful years that preceded our entry into the World War, and there
was no collective proffer after we had entered. Even more, there was
at the outset no instinctive recourse to the economist on the part of
public authority, and but slow and half-hearted requisition of his
services thereafter.
The results were twofold-both unfortunate. On the one hand,
failing systematic mobilization, a wasteful individualism prevailed.
The Ainerican economist either ate his soul out in enforced inactivity;
or, the situation becoming intolerable, accepted subordinate, often
clerical position, rather than do nothing at all. And on the other
hand, his proper role was taken over in part by a group of transmuted
men of affairs; in part by a corps of business technicians, distinguished
from the economic investigator by the more austere title "statistician."
Of the whole company of American economists, including all of those
whose names we delight to honor, not a single figure was in the first
instance chosen or was thereafter permitted to exercise formative,
determining influence in the economic conduct of the war. Services
of great usefulness, of high importance, were rendered by almost every
member of our body, and I shlould fail lamentably in my purpose did I
seem to be insensible of this. But nowhere and at no time was the
opportunity afforded to shape and direct. And on the other hand, in
instance after instance, constructive discretion and responsible leadership
were vested in men whose excellencies, high as the heavens, were
yet marked by absence of those qualities which we insist distinguish the
scientifically equipped economist.
This is no light statement. But it has not been hastily conceived
nor recklessly phrased. Over and above the great company of those


### ---Economics-1922-0-10.txt---
usefully, but administratively, engaged-one, two, perhaps three names
come to mind as of economists who by circumstance or designation
may seem to have been permitted to exercise what I have ventured to
call formative influence. But closer scrutiny will establish even as to
these, that the notable service which each in his respective field was
able to render was not because but in spite of the range of discretionary
power.

This dispossession of the economist would have resolved itself into a
mere slighting of sensibilities, had it been justified of the result. But
the exhibit here is unmistakable. If we refuse to be flattened out by
the "we won the war" argument, garnished with its "hells" and
"damns," and survive the more subtle "it was necessary under the
circumstances" fallacy, with its aura of officialdom, the unpleasing
fact stands forth that the history of the war discloses a series of
costly economic errors that expert guidance should have avoided.
The four great areas of economic intervention in our war activities
were:

1. Labor adjustment.
2. Price-fixing.

3. Revenue provision.
4. Banking administration.
In each of these, government practice was shaped- ither by deliberate
policy or opportunist drift-independent, even in disregard of the
economist's opinion. In the execution of such practices the economist
was utilized and his influence was exercised. But the formative policy
was elsewhere initiated and the controlling guidance was elsewhere
lodged.

The particulars may be briefly reviewed:
1. The history of labor adjustment in the war is a complex of
opportunist adaptation of a peace-time mechanism, imperfectly comprehended,
to a war-time requirement, inadequately visualized the
whole shot with a premature idealism.
In 1917 the labor world was still the least well-understood part, in
structure and function, of our economic organization. The simpler
magnitudes-distribution, unionization, wage levels, were imperfectly
enumerated, and the deeper elements-the interaction of workers as to
unionism, localities, and trades-were not even apprehended. Where
the expert would have trodden cautiously, the amateur rushed in unhesitatingly.
There resulted a series of wasteful ventures, out of
which the bare concept of a solution-a common labor policy in all
war industry-did not emerge until the war was half over and the
actual realization of which was still unattained when the war was over.
Just as the problem of labor distribution was met with an uninformed


### ---Economics-1922-0-11.txt---
empiricism, so the problem of labor remuneration was approached
with a premature idealism. From insistence that the outbreak
of war must not serve as a pretext to sweep away accredited
industrial defences, to endeavor that the exigencies of war be used to
elevate wage levels to an imperfectly ascertained, inexpertly administered
standard of comfort-this is a far cry, the sharp echoes of which
were certain to ring in the nation's ears long after the event.
2. Price-fixing has been recently described as "one of the most
important economic novelties that resulted from the war."28 It was
novel not in the sense of a new and untried device: but rather,
in that it jettisoned accredited economic opinion. No rubric in our
creed seemed more secure, none more safely an induction from historical
experience, nor more firmly buttressed upon primary economic axioms
than the unwisdom of a legal price maximum.
An appeal to doctrinal authority is no sufficient logic in the political
economy of war. Inter arma silent leges may be invoked as to opinion
as well as to affairs-when the nation's existence is in the balance.
A distinguished leader in the financial world has defended a somewhat
like election in an epigram: "It was patriotism that for the time
being displaced or disregarded economic laws or principles."'
Obviously, we have to do here with the fineness of our scientific texture.
Even patriotism may not flout the conservation of energy or the
combustion of gases or bacterial incubation. Certainly economic uniformities,
even the best of them, are not as the corner-stones of physics,
chemistry and biology. But before propulsion into the outer darkness
they are, at least, entitled to a day in court with counsel for the
defense from their own exponents. And this as to the adoptionadoption,
remember, not operation-of the policy of price-fixing was
denied the economist.
A competent participant, judicial but sympathetic, has said in review:
"Government price-fixing during the war was not uniform in
its objects, and was little guided by principles or deliberate policies.
In the main, it was opportunist, feeling its way from case to case."30
This concerns a later matter, into which-tempting as is the invitation
-it is not permitted to enter. But however faint the praise as to
practice, incomparably less even than this may be said as to the spirit
of entry. There were definite ends to be attained: the protection of
the public in fuel and food; the protection of the government in essential


### ---Economics-1922-0-12.txt---
materials. To these ends there were alternative means: administrative
bargaining on patriotic basis; commandeering, potential or
actual; non-inflationary financing; licensing of fuel supply; control
of transport facilities; appropriation of war profits. It is by no
means clear that the objects in view would have been better servedeven
as well served-by any or all of these methods as by direct pricefixing.
But a statement to the contrary is quite as unwarranted. Until
there has been a fuller inquest-attended by more than ordinary difficulties-
in which will be weighed the consequences of what was done,
compared with the possible results of what might have been donethe
final verdict must be withheld.
That, however, which is certain, is that the determination of policyor,
if a less conscious procedure be emphasized, the initial step-in
essence, a radical departure from accepted economic opinion and practice-
was taken deliberately, almost leisurely, without either that expert
canvass of the problem or that consultative regard for scientific
opinion which even in war time is the requisite of administrative
efficiency.

3. The nation approached its war financing with the fairest prospect
of actual practice conforming to sound theory. The necessity
of revenue provision on a vast scale had been admitted; the policy of a
relatively large ratio of taxes to loans had been adopted; the danger
of "the very serious hardship which would be likely to arise out of
inflation" had been set forth in a presidential utterance; expert counsel
had been summoned in the preparation of the tax schedule.
Definite adherence to this program would have meant sound war
financing. But at an early stage the straight hard road of taxation
and funding was left for the treacherous ease of "finance by bank
credits." Thereafter our war financing had primary regard for fiscal
convenience and business advantage to the neglect of general wellbeing.
To supply the exchequer readilv and painlessly with ample
funds, bank credit was utilized in the form of certificate borrowingwith
the consequences of deposit and note inflation, rising prices and
social injustice.

A careful student of "the political economy of war" has pointed
out that "finance by bank credits"-"inherently bad" and to be restricted
"within the narrowest possible limits," though it be-is likely
to be resorted to even by strong governments at war, because of "the
fear of popular resentment against high taxation in an overt form"
and "the fear that an offer of very high interest upon loans might
make upon neutrals an impression of financial weakness."'32


### ---Economics-1922-0-13.txt---
Neither of these factors was present in our experience to a degree
sufficient to justify resort to bank credit financing. The possible attitude
of neutrals did not even figure; while public disposition towards
increased tax burdens was grim acceptance, tinctured with nothing
worse than that degree of grumbling which in matters of taxation is
the mark of a decent self-respect. In so far as our necessary resort
to inflation financing can be explained at all, it is traceable to that
"borrow cheap" policy, born of false analogy, fiscal absolutism and
neglect of expert opinion, which in the Civil War lashed us with fiat
currency, and in this war scourged us with fiat credit.
The amazing feature of this process is the completeness with which
it remained unavowed by its sponsors and undiscerned by the public.
The certificate of indebtedness which in the seven weeks interval between
the Revenue act of March 3, and the First Liberty Loan act of April
24, 1917, passed from its traditional role as a short-time investment
obligation issued in anticipation of the proceeds of a funded loan
designed to meet extraordinary expenditure, to an habitual device for
the extension of bank credit in the form of government deposits by subscribing
financial institutions, continued to be officially described as a
mere convenient mode of avoiding monetary strain, with never an intimation
of wider significance."
The device of permissive "payment by credit," worked out we are
told,34 in connection with the First Liberty Loan at a Sunday conference
in May, 1917, between representatives of the Treasury, of the Federal
Reserve Board and of the New York Liberty Loan Committee, was
extended to certificate borrowing as a whole, with consequences of the
utmost gravity, almost by administrative tolerance.
There was no intimation that in essence a new borrowing policy had
been inaugurated, with neither specific authorization nor general comprehension;
that the certificate of indebtedness had been transformed
into the British Treasury Bill on Ways and Means Advance, unknown
and untried in our experience, and that by its lavish use we were heading
straight for the evils which the Cunliffe Commission a year before
had explored and made public, as brilliantly as its great predecessor
the Bullion Committee had done a century earlier as to a related
problem."


### ---Economics-1922-0-14.txt---
An advocate of our war financing has written of such development
as "tendencies of which the Treasury officials themselves were probably
only dimly aware.""a Ricardo, to a like plea in extenuation, reviewing
the entrenched stolidity of the directors of the Bank of England during
the first decade of the Restriction, made ringing answer: "I do, therefore,
acquit them of being influenced by interested motives but their
mistakes, if they are such, are in their effects quite as pernicious to the
community."37

4. Beginning with the flotation of war loans at an artificially low
rate, the Treasury was driven to support the "borrow cheap" policy
both as to the bond buying and certificate issue by insuring a low
preferential discount rate at the federal reserve banks. Made'possible
by political domination of an essentially non-political institution, this
misuse of the federal reserve system as the handmaiden of the Treasury
was attended with severe penalties.
There was injected into the exchange mechanism of the country a
great body of deposit and note currency entirely unrelated to commercial
needs and serving fiscal rather than monetary purposes. With
inflation came gross depreciation in the monetary standard and distress-
causing rise in living costs. Higher prices of materials and services
added to the cost of war and weighted its overhang. Excessive
gains were reaped, unrelated to valid enterprise. Undeserved losses
were suffered by the depreciation of public loans. Worst of all, cheapened
credit stimulated extensive speculation, with still further rise in
prices and capital shortage.38
instrument of inflation and the funded debt is not." As practical a financier as
Mr. Warburg must however recognize that the question in issue is not as to hypothetical
possibility but as to the positive occurrence. That certificate borrowing at an
artifically low rate "by credit," and therefore of necessity from the banks, was
responsible, during the war and more particularly after the armistice, for a vastly
greater degree of inflation than would have attended funding operations, at rates
dictated by the market valuation of capital and in forms designed for investment
absorption-is, I fear, a conclusion which the inquiries of the Cunliffe Commission,
the penetrating analyses of Professor Pigou, and a mass of evidence in England and
the United States, remove from further controversy.
As to Mr. Warburg's statements that our borrowing machinery was "the best
that could have been devised" and that "no other way was open to pay for the war"
-valuable as are such opinions coming from one "right in the midst of it"-I can
only anticipate the views developed below, that scientific verity and not assumed
expediency is the ultimate standard by which fiscal policy even in war-time, must
be appraised.

-aE. L. Bogart, in Political Science Quarterly, March, 1920, p. 160.


### ---Economics-1922-0-15.txt---
The Federal Reserve Board, shorn of its essential power to control
expansion at a critical stage, thus became an impotent witness to an
orgy of credit and currency inflation, which the belated resort to
higher discount rates-literally compelled by the imminence of a
threatened gold standard-was able to correct only through the wastes
and losses of an imperative deflation.
Free supply of bank credit in connection with our borrowing in the
period of belligerency may perhaps be explained-though not justified
-by the exigencies of war. But not even this plea is admissible to the
resumption of such policies after the Armistice and the continued
maintenance of artifically low discount rates. Designed originally to
facilitate tiae anticipation of war loans and taxes, the preferential discount
rate operated during the war as an instrumentality for "financing
by bank credit." After the war, it degenerated into a device for
salvaging the "borrow cheap" entanglement and for masking the existence
and staving off the maturity of a huge floating debt.
The procedure of credit issues to balance current budgets, so violently
reprobated in the case of European states, continued in essence our
practice during the post-Armstice months. Instead of using both fiat
currency and fiat credit we restricted ourselves to the more insidious
form. The demoralizing effect of the two methods upon the social
structure has differed only in degree.
III

In the security of retrospect it is tempting to indulge in counsel of
perfection. The din has quieted, the fever subsided and practices for
which precedent was lacking and occasion was imperative are likely
to be estimated in the wisdom of hindsight. John Bright declared of
his opponents: "They always have been wrong; they always will be
wrong and when they cease to be wrong they will cease to be the Tory
party."3" It is right to guard against this-to forego outright
stricture and to temper absolute valuation by relative allowance. But
withal there must be just weight and measure. It would be reckless to
assert that the intricate problems of our war economy would have been
fully served or properly solved by the scientist in responsible control.
The economist will not wish to be charged with Canning's criticism of
Lord Sidmouth: "Carrying into politics the indefinable air of a
physician inspecting the tongue of the state."40 There is always the
rare statesman like Peel who "in three cases out of four knew a thing
just in time, after it was known to the philosophers, before it was


### ---Economics-1922-0-16.txt---
known to the empirics."' But it remains certain that the economist's
grasp of the immediate subject-matter, his acquaintance with comparable
experience, his mental habit in social valuation give him distinctive
equipment for the formative service which was denied him.
Divested of the opportunity to shape economic policies-partly
through his own inertia, partly through political neglect-the role
of the political economist becomes that of a constructive critic. Resolute
against the negative quibbling of the embittered faultfinder,
watchful against the soporific emanations of the throne his mission
must be fearless, unequivocal assertion of the verities of his science, as
against the prejudice of the moment, the pressure of class interest, or
the quietism of office.
He must seek, increasingly, to lay bare the mistakes that have been
made and impute them to the proper source, whether of practices or of
persons-this in no vindictive sense but in order that there may be a
strict assignment of responsibility, to the end of abandoning unsound
practices, of devising appropriate remedial measures and of avoiding
like pitfalls in the future.
The finest traditions of his past enjoin this: It is the call of Adam
Smith, inveighing in behalf of freedom of trade against "the clamorous
importunity of partial interests." It is the summons of Malthus
denouncing the poor laws of England as a set "of grating, inconvenient
and tyrannical laws." It is the insistence of Ricardo, protesting
against the misuse of the sinking fund. It is the acridity of John
Stuart Mill, in condemnation of the inflationist proposals of the Birmingham
currency school.

In this sense, the restraint of the American economist in the war
period is not exhilarating: a record of substantial practical service
in many directions, rendered with fidelity, devotion and efficiency, but
service essentially contributory and acquiescent. Of that resolute
intractibility against scientific error, uncompromising and outspoken,
which must distinguish the economist as sentinel and critic-there is
in the period of actual belligerency little evidence.
This involves no charge of intellectual cowardice.42 In the cynicism
of world collapse, George Brandes has lately revived an epigram imputed
to Frederick the Great: "I begin by taking. Then I always
find men of science to prove the justice of my claim." The possibility
is peculiar neither to time nor place. There is danger of scholarship
becoming official in a democracy no less than in an absolutism. Public
passion cracks as sharp a whip as any despot, and the applause of the


### ---Economics-1922-0-17.txt---
market-place is as grave a menace to independent thought as the favor
of the throne.

Of these things the American economist stands absolved. Less clear
is the extent to which he held resolute for scientific verity as against
practical compromise. "The function of science is to expose the naked
facts," a recent scholar has declared. "It is for politicians to decide
how to resist developments which are judged to be economically undesirable.
"43 In the economics of war, governmental policy is beset by
two opposed forces. On the one hand is opportunism and practicability:
opportunism in using the stress of war need to accomplish
ends in doubt; practicability in meeting the war strain with least
trouble and resistance. On the other hand is scientific proof and
economic law, rugged and dure, straight and narrow, serving the public
need with measures conceived solely with respect to the social calculus,
and hewing to this line even with struggle in making and difficulty in
carrying out.

Something of our opportunity here was surrendered by prematurity
of pronouncement; something was frittered away by indulgence in
insecure dicta. In the main, however, it is true that the war-time
reserve of the economist proceeded from that ready assent to the
policy and practices of authority which, in time of great national peril,
is the instinct of democracy. At a time when "public opinion could
largely be disregarded because public assent could be assumed," the
economist as alert scientist was submerged in the economist as docile
citizen.

For the post-Armistice period there is a different story to tell. The
war won, the economist regained his poise. Realizing that the doctrine
of practical necessity can do yeoman service in defense of unsound
war-time policies, but that it may not be as securely invoked in the
calmer years that follow; supplied with data before lacking or inaccessible-
he became vigilant and articulate.
Analysis established the clear fact that the United States had
financed the war and its aftermath largely by reliance upon banik credit.
Inflation, theretofore "a high-brow fancy of the professors"-to be
tolerantly ignored by the public, to be summarily dismissed by men
of affairs, and to be held forth bogey-fashion as a warning against
non-adoption of official policies-was exposed as an avoidable evil of
our post-war economy, contributing to high prices, business profiteering,
speculative excesses and social disquiet. The Federal Reserve
Board's belated recourse to higher discount rates in correction of an
overextended credit structure was indicted. The naive assumption of
industrial underproduction-dearly beloved of financial column writers


### ---Economics-1922-0-18.txt---
-was cut ofl in its prime by definitive statistical exhibit. The obscurities
of the Pittman Silver Purchase act were illumined and the consequences,
actual and prospective, of that remarkable measure exposed.
The importance of prompt return to normal distributive
methods and ordinary price mechanism was emphasized-in face of
strong resistanice. The penalties of emotionalism in governmental
labor policies were made clear, and, at the same time, bar put to the
exploitation of trade depression in behalf of anti-unionism. Emphatic
as to the error of retaining blunderbuss war taxes in a peace-time
economy, there was insistence that the ideals of fiscal justice- confused
by the shrill chorus of the market place, even shaken by uncertain tones
from our own spokesmen-must determine the nation's revenue system.
In short, the economist has filed formal caveat against recourse to
the argument of assumed expediency and momentary opportunism in
defense of war policies which are theoretically vulnerable. He has
insisted that expediency is a subjective and relative term, which one
man regards as such and another will deny, and that as soon as we
leave the safe moorings of that which is scientifically sound-we are
adrift. He recalls that Secretary Chase doubtless deemed the greenback
unsound "in theory," but justified it as a practical expedient.
So too Mr. Bryan's silver proposals and a hundred dangerous ventures
with which we have from time to time been tempted. His position is,
in a word, that for an administrator to engage in a theoretically
unsound practice and to defend it on the score of practical necessity
reduces the matter to a rigid calculus, as to which-until the final outcome
-official opinion is worth as much, but only as much, as that
emanating from any other equally competent quarter.
IV

The economist's task is far from done; but it enters upon a new
phase. In the political economy of war, as of peace, time holds the
bank. Whatever the lapse, in the end truth comes into its own. Too
late to change the outcome, all the more is the true prophet acclaimed.
The clear errors, even the hard reactions of mistaken war and post-war
policies have begun to appear. Much more, perhaps, awaits. With
the disclosure must come-unless all signs fail-a wider interest in
economic study, a tremendous gain in the scientist's repute. The
prophet as seer may be without honor; but not the prophet as victor.
The market place, smarting in its hurt, is quick to magnify the virtue
of him whose neglected counsel, it comes to appear, might have softened,
perhaps warded off, the blow.
More than once, economic experience has developed the inconvenient


### ---Economics-1922-0-19.txt---
habit of exalting the horn of "the professors," and of vindicating
scientific opinion as against economic opportunism. But this time the
issues have been larger, the alternatives sharper, the penalties costlier.
It will be surprising if the rebound is not greater.
Political economy reached its heyday in the decade following the
Napoleonic struggle. It did so because great economic and social
problems-the dislocation of world upheaval-pressed imperatively
for settlement upon a world disillusioned by bitter experience as to the
wisdom of its practical men, and expectant in the light of justified
forecast as to the reasoning of its economic thinkers. Public opinion
became sensible as never before that the principle of general
causation figured in the business of getting a living; that times
were bad not merely by chance; that high prices, falling exchanges,
agricultural distress, industrial unemployment, burdensome
taxes, resulted from the pursuit or from the neglect of positive policies;
that a group of inoffensive tractarians, then barely beginning to call
themselves "political economists," had given specialized study to such
matters and had time and again sounded warning note, and that therefore
it might be a prudent thing to learn what this was about and to
pay some greater regard to the spokesmen.
So, too, in the later aftermath of another cataclysm the world
stands, irresolute and hesitant perhaps, but none the less receptive
for economic counsel. The public mind is in scapegoat-making mood
-and the empiricist is its sin-offering. As false priests are expelled
from the temple, new ones will be installed. Tested as acolyte, the
economist awaits induction.
V

Uninfluential in formative policy, uncompromising as scientific protestant,
vindicated by outright event, to be acclaimed as guide and
prophet-the spiral holds. One final phase remains-relapse into
formalism. Will the parallelism obtain even here? Shall we be witnesses
to, even participants in, another classical political economywith
all the excesses that the term implies?
The answer turns upon the degree to which conscious purpose will
deflect the normal trend. If the economist, heady with larger place,
foregoes his birthright-the horoscope is cast. Larger practical influence,
wider popular interest, artificial rigidity of utterance, relapse
into paradox-like dicta, proneness to definite forecast, intentness upon
doctrinal vindication, dullness to new evidence these, as a century
before, will be the stages in his undoing. From class advocacy in its


### ---Economics-1922-0-20.txt---
vulgar sense he will be saved; from the more subtle contagion of postwar
reaction he will not be immune.
But this need not be so. If the economist, tutored by his past,
maintain his full scientific stature, toiling laboriously in the assembly
of data, formulating trial hypotheses with caution, abstaining religiously
from armchair theorizing, subjecting tentative uniformatives
to rigid verification, fearless in the knowledge that is power-he will
preserve his scientific vantage with widening range and profounder
impress. By the sheer virtue of his scholarship, will he prevail upon
affairs.

### ---Economics-1923-0-01.txt---
One of the most significant recent developments in the labor organization
field has been the multiplication of what are variously called
shop committees, works councils, or company unions. First established
in this country by the government labor boards to meet the war
emergency, shop committees might well have been expected to dwindle
and die after the boards creating them had been dissolved. Many of them
of course did so, but many more new committees have been organized.
According to the survey of the National Industrial Conference Board
the number of company unions or "works councils"2 in the United
States increased from two hundred and twenty-five in August, 1919,
to seven hundred and twenty-five in February, 1922. This was in spite
of the disappearance of fully one hundred of the councils which were
in existence when the war ended. To appreciate fully the significance
of this development we must contrast it with the course of trade unionism
in the same period. During the two years 1920 to 1922 the
affiliated membership of the American Federation of Labor decreased
by more than 800,000 or over twenty per cent.
It is my purpose to consider the advantages and disadvantages of
these two types of labor organizations, company unions and trade
unions, from the viewpoint of the public interest, the interest of the
employees and the interest of employers. Our experience with company
unions is so recent that any discussion of them must be in part speculative.
To make my treatment as definite as the nature of the problem
permits, I shall limit myself to this issue in relation to public service
industries. Conclusions reached in this narrow field will admittedly be
inapplicable or only partly applicable to competitive industries, but
at this stage of our progress intensive analysis should be more useful


### ---Economics-1923-0-02.txt---
than the formulation of far-reaching, which too often prove to be only
far-fetched, conclusions.
Public service industries may, for the purpose of this discussion, be
defined as industries whose continuous operation is vital to the public
interest. Such for illustration are local public utilities, as street railways
and steam railroads.
Because the continuous operation of these industries is of vital
public concern we are beginning to develop a special public policy
toward them designed to insure uninterrupted service. This has been
the obj ective of our gradually unfolding railroad labor policy. In
order to judge which form of labor organization is best adapted to
such industries, we must consider the direction in which this policy
is carrying us and its probable consequences.
It took Congress many years to realize that special measures to
insure the continuous operation of the railroads were needed. When
convinced that something should be done, its first thought, registered
in the Erdman act of 1898, was that mediation, conciliation and
voluntary arbitration would suffice to prevent railroad strikes, and
for a time they did suffice. The Newlands act of 1913 attempted to
save a situation that was becoming admittedly more and more precarious
by providing more elaborate machinery for mediation, conciliation,
and arbitration. Experience soon demonstrated that something
more than a change of machinery was needed. The Adamson
act of 1916 introduced, by a method and in a form that have been
generally condemned since,' the principle that certain basic standards
in the railroad industry-in this instance, the standard work dayshould
be determined by law. The Transportation act of 1920 further
developed this principle by prescribing that the wages and working
conditions to be established by the Railroad Labor Board, which it
created, should be just and reasonable as tested by the seven criteria
which it formulated. This act further made it the "duty" of the
railroads and their employees "to exert every reasonable effort and
adopt every available means to avoid any interruption" of the service,
but it stopped short of prescribing penalties for non-fulfilment of
this duty.

The recent shopmen's strike proved that Congress must do more to
prevent a tie-up of the railroads than formulate a new code of duties
for railroad men and managers. The conclusion of President Harding
as to what this more should be is significant. In his recent message


### ---Economics-1923-0-03.txt---
he advocates, in characteristically guarded language, that the functions
of the Railroad Labor Board be transferred to a labor division of an
enlarged interstate commerce commission, that its decisions be given
the force of law, and that railroad strikes be prohibited.
It was no accident that the same winter in which Congress passed
the Transportation act in face of the determined opposition of the
leaders of organized labor, Kansas, under the forceful guidance of
Governor Allen, adopted her Industrial Court law. This affords even
clearer evidence of the inevitable trend of governmental policy toward
labor controversies on public service industries. The Kansas act not
only creates a court with broad powers to regulate wages, hours, and
working conditions when in dispute in industries affected with a public
interest, but prescribes more clearly than the Transportation act what
standard of just and reasonable rates the court is to apply to wages
and working conditions, and prohibits with severe penalties strikes
or other concerted efforts to interrupt the continuous operation of
such industries.

It would be a bold prophet who would attempt to predict just what
developments in our governmental policy toward public service industries
lie immediately before us. In the see-saw of politics, President
Harding's recommendations may be disregarded and Governor Allen's
beloved Court may be abolished. But I venture the opinion that whatever
course the legislation of the immediate future may take, the logic
of the situation will as time goes on lead us to strengthen rather than
weaken the machinery for insuring continuous operation of public
service industries. This means the maintenance of an authoritative
board or court to determine labor conditions on the railroads and of
similar state boards or courts to determine conditions on street railways
and other local public service industries. It means the formulation
in statutes of the standards as regards wages and working conditions
that are to be required in connection with public service industries.
Finally it means prohibition with enforceable penalties (not imprisonment
4 but fines which pursue the offender until paid, as in New Zealand)


### ---Economics-1923-0-04.txt---
of strikes or other concerted efforts to interrupt the service. I base
this opinion on two grounds. In the first place the strike weapon in
these industries is beginning to be a boomerang. The very fact that
continuous operation of public service industries is vital to the public
interest insures in advance public condemnation of the group which
undertakes to interrupt such operation, however great the provocation.
For that reason the shopmen's strike of last summer was lost
before it was begun. The same circumstance foredooms a street railway
strike, under any but the most unusual conditions, to failure.
The managers of our railroads and street railway companies are
beginning to understand the situation. Few of them doubt their ability
to break, with the aid of indignant public opinion, any strike that
may be started provided the government prevents violence and intimidation
on the part of the strikers.
My second and stronger reason for believing that we shall persist
in the policies of adjusting labor conditions in public service industries
through boards or courts and prohibiting strikes is that we have
already pressed the policy of regulating rates and quality of service
so far that we cannot well avoid similarly regulating wages. Public
authority cannot long content itself with prescribing that "rates shall
be fair and reasonable" without also prescribing that costs, including
wages, shall be fair and reasonable.
The background against which we must consider the advantages and
disadvantages of company unions versus trade unions in public service
industries is then a situation in which the strike is already a discredited
and is rapidly becoming a futile weapon, in which boards and courts
are being established and strengthened to adjudicate labor disputes,
in which definite standards as to hours, wages, and working conditions
are being crystallized into law, and in which to an increasing extent
the law will also prohibit and punish combined action aiming at
interruption of the operation of these industries.5
We are now ready to ask what are the tests of a desirable form of
labor organization from the viewpoint of the public, of the employees
concerned and of the employers. From the viewpoint of the public the
ends to be advanced are continuous operation, economy and efficiency
in operation and the development of more intelligent, more capable and


### ---Economics-1923-0-05.txt---
more public-spirited workers and citizens. From the viewpoint of
employees economy and efficiency in operation and the development of
a higher type of worker must be stressed, but even more important
are liberal compensation, moderate hours, safe and sanitary working
conditions and the fullest participation by the workers in the determination
of their working conditions that is compatible with economy and
efficiency. Finally from the viewpoint of employers the desiderata
are continuous operation, maximum economy and efficiency, low labor
costs, and ready acceptance by the employees of changes deemed by
the management to be necessary to the good of the business.
Economy and efficiency of operation are desirable ends to the public,
to employees and to employers. Which type of organization, company
unions or trade unions, is likely to contribute the more to economical
and efficient operation? There can be little question that judged by
this test company unions are superior. Limited in membership to the
employees of the business organization which they serve, they readily
develop an interest in and a loyalty to that organization which tend
to increased efficiency. Since the questions discussed and the conditions
to be regulated all relate to the one organization, the employee
representatives, and through them the rank and file, soon acquire a
knowledge of the production problems with which the employer is
struggling, realize their community of interest with him in solving these
problems successfully and develop that cooperative attitude that is
bound to follow from such realization.
By contrast trade unions, including in their membership employeest
not of one organization only but of as many competing organizations
throughout the country as can be induced to join, inevitably stress the
opposition of interest between their members and the business organizations
they serve. The very reason for their existence is the conviction
that the interests of employers and employees are opposed.
It is not by promoting economy and efficiency that they hope to benefit
their members but by bringing organized pressure to bear upon the
employers. The preamble of the constitution of the American Federation
of Labor, and the preambles of nearly all of the affiliated trade
unions, emphasize the contentious aspect of the relationship between
employers and employees. As the Federation's constitution phrases
it: "Whereas a struggle is going on in all the nations of the civilized
world between the oppressors and the oppressed of all countries, a
struggle between the capitalist and the laborer which grows in intensity
from year to year and will work disastrous results to the toiling
millions if they are not combined for mutual protection and benefit, it
therefore behooves," etc. Starting with this analysis of industrial
relations, the officials of American trade unions might be expected
to be even more belligerent in their attitude toward employers than in


### ---Economics-1923-0-06.txt---
fact they are. Individually they are often, if not usually, fully
aware of the cooperative aspect of the relationship between employers
and employees and alive to the dependence of favorable conditions for
their constituents upon efficient and economical production. But the
very form of the organizations which they represent precludes them
from being as cooperative in their practical attitude as the representatives
of company unions. Since they deal with many competing employers,
some considerate of their employees, some hard-faced exploiters,
they necessarily conceive of the interests they represent as on the
whole opposed to the interests of the employer and deem it their principal
business to force employers, through the pressure that organization
enables them to exert, to grant more favorable conditions than these
would voluntarily concede.
It requires no argument to prove that company unions are likewise
more conducive than trade unions to the continuous operation of the
industries with which their members are connected. When not pledged
by their constitutions to refrain from strikes, as are many of the railroad
company unions recently organized, they are deterred from such
activities by the lack of outside support.
While the evidence thus favors the company union as the better
agency for promoting economy and efficiency and continuity of operation,
the argument seems all on the side of the trade union from the
viewpoint of the employees' chief interests-favorable wages, hours,
working conditions, and participation in determining these conditions.
The company union is obviously not equipped to contend effectively for
better conditions with a reluctant employer. In the first place, all
the members, including even the officials of the organization, are
employees of the employer to be influenced and dependent upon his
good will for a livelihood. Second, because of their local character
they are debarred from acquiring knowledge of conditions in other
establishments where perhaps wages, hours, and working arrangements
are more favorable and thus are unable to exert the pressure which
possession of this knowledge would make possible. In the third place,
again because of their local character, they can offer no effective resistance
to adverse changes initiated by the employer, since without
outside support they can do little more than protest against what they
consider unfair.

The trade union enjoys obvious advantages at all three points. Its
officers and most of its members are independent of any individual
establishment or company and therefore can more aggressively press
for desirable changes. Second, its officers are in contact with conditions
in the given industry throughout the country and able to use
this broader knowledge effectively in connection with any local controversy
that may arise. Third, knowledge that his employees have


### ---Economics-1923-0-07.txt---
their trade union behind them serves to deter the employer from
initiating unfavorable changes, and when he does attempt such changes
the members immediately affected can resist much more vigorously
because of the support of the membership at large on which they can
usually count.

For all these reasons trade unions promise greater benefits to their
members than company unions, but there is another side that must
not be entirely overlooked. Overemphasis of the struggle aspect may
result in so hampering production that the larger share of the smaller
output that employees secure leaves them worse off than the smaller
share of the larger output that might have gone to them had they
been without such powerful organizations. The conditions that have
developed in the building trades in New York and Chicago illustrate
this. Many employers claim that the restrictive rules, jurisdictional
controversies, and wasteful practices of the unions so add to the cost
of construction that the whole building industry is kept in a depressed
condition when it might be highly prosperous for all concerned. This
may be an exaggerated view but no one who has followed recent investigations
can question that wage-earners in the building trades pay
collectively in unemployment and irregular employment a high price
for any benefits the restrictive policies of their craft unions may seem
to yield. Only when the standard conditions secured through trade
union bargaining are free from wasteful and hampering restrictions,
such as would not and could not be exacted by company unions, is the
case entirely in their favor even as regards wages, hours, and working
conditions.

The superiority of the company over the trade union as regards
low labor costs and the "ready acceptance by the employees of changes
deemed by the management to be necessary to the good of the business,"
the principal desiderata of employers, is obvious from the very nature
of the two organizations. Closer contact with and better understanding
of the production problems of the establishments they serve
make the officers and members of company unions much more openminded
with reference to proposed changes than the officials of trade
unions can be expected to be. This difference is registered in the
frequent complaint of employers that the trade unions try to run their
business and the countercharge of trade union leaders that company
unions (to quote from the A. F. of L. resolution on the subject) are
The more significant declarations in this resolution (No. 201) adopted at the


### ---Economics-1923-0-08.txt---
"a snare set up by the companies for the express purpose of deluding
workers into the belief that they have some protection" when in reality
they have none.

How is the issue affected in the case of public service industries when,
in the interest of continuous operation, the law prescribes standards
as to wages, hours, and working conditions that must be maintained,
creates boards or courts for enforcing these standards, and prohibits
the organized workers from joining in strikes to interrupt the continuous
flow of the commodities or services vital to the public interest?
It is evident at once that prohibitions on the right to strike largely
neutralize the advantages which flow from trade union organization.
Realization of this fact goes far to explain the uncompromising hostility
of the officials of the American trade unions to any curtailment
of the right to strike. Officers of the railroad brotherhoods have long
realized that actual use of the strike weapon would arouse such a
storm of public disapproval that the strike would be bound to fail and
yet they insist on a retention of the nom,inal right to strike because
they realize how its withdrawal will weaken the force of their efforts
to maintain the full strength of their unions.
To illustrate the point, consider what a feeble appeal the national
organization of street railway employees is able to offer to men
employed by a traction company in Kansas now that they have been
prohibited by law from engaging in strikes and at the same time afforded
an opportunity to carry their demands for higher wages, shorter
hours, or improved conditions to the Kansas Industrial Court! The
national organization cannot even assist greatly in the efforts to
change this Kansas plan since it owes its existence to Kansan rather
than national legislation. On the other hand, the case for organization
into company unions can be presented with convincing force by a
Kansas traction company which really wishes to establish better relations
with its employees and through their intelligent co6peration to
afford more economical and efficient service to the Kansas public.
Through their joint efforts the employees organized in a company
over trade unions they are at the same time just as actively enforcing a series  of vicious practices that hamstring such organizations and render them useless to
their employees;


### ---Economics-1923-0-09.txt---
union can improve greatly both the safety and the efficiency of the
service. If the employer couples with intelligent encouragement of
the company union considerate plans for enabling the employees to
acquire stock in the corporation, for profit-sharing, and for insurance
against illness, unemployment and dependent old age, he can readily
make any promised benefits of the national trade union seem hollow
and unreal and develop an esprit de corps among his employees that
will react not only to his advantage but to their advantage and to the
advantage of the public-providing always that just and reasonable
standards as to wages and hours are maintained by public authority.
The case is not so clear in connection with the operating departments
of the railroads. Here the employees are scattered over a
wider territory, standards as to wages, hours, etc., must approximate
uniformity on different roads at least in the same district and there
are other circumstances favoring national organizations. As we persist,
however, in the policy on which we have embarked of prescribing
by law standards for railroad employees, of maintaining a government
board to enforce these standards, and of limiting the right to strike,
steam railway employees, like street railway employees in Kansas,
must feel less strongly the urge to maintain their national organizations
and must become more alive to the advantages of more co6perative
relations with the employing companies.
All of the advantages of both forms of organization might be secured,
if railroad executives would continue to settle questions of wages,
etc., by negotiation with the brotherhoods and on their side the
brotherhoods would cooperate in the organization of their members
into company units for promoting safety, efficiency, and economy on
their respective roads and for adjusting local differences locally.'
Both might then use their influence not to destroy the Railroad Labor
Board but to bring about its reorganization so that it will more intelligently
fulfil its dual function of insuring the continuous operation
of the railroads and adjusting fairly and reasonably issues which the
executives and organized workers cannot settle through negotiation.
I have reserved for final consideration the aspect that is after all of
chief concern to economists-which form of organization, company
unions or trade unions, is likely to lead in the long run to the development
of the "more intelligent, more capable and more public-spirited
workers and citizens"? To answer this question it is necessary to
have in mind some ideal as to the goal toward which our industrial
development is leading. The ideal which commends itself to my own


### ---Economics-1923-0-10.txt---
mind is an industrial society in which the average level of intelligence
and understanding is continuously rising, in which the ownership of
capital is becoming more and more widely diffused and in which the
workers are progressively better paid for more congenial work varied
by more ample opportunities for leisure and recreation. With an
increase in average intelligence I venture also to hope that there may be
such improvements in our political organization that public service
industries may be more commonly not only owned but efficiently operated
by the government for the common benefit, that co6perative enterprises
may become more numerous and more habitually successful, and
that the employees who continue to work for profit-seeking employers
may be given a progressively larger voice in the determination of the
conditions under which they work and may be insured a reasonable
share in the profits they help to earn for such employers.
Toward the realization of this ideal, American trade unions have
made a contribution of inestimable value. Without them the struggle
between employers and employees would have been so unequal that the
wage system all along the line might have become, what it still is at
its worst, another name for the sweating system, and the gulf that
separates employers and employees might have been so widened that
the proposal to bridge it would have seemed chimerical. In their work
of fostering the independence and raising the standards of wageearners,
trade unions have necessarily developed as fighting organizations.
They have constantly stressed the opposition of interest between
employers and employees and the strike has been their most
effective weapon. If my analysis is correct we have now reached a
stage in public service industries where we can no longer tolerate the
use of the strike and where we are beginning to establish standards
through legislation and through adjustment boards which render resort
to it unnecessary.

Is the company union or the trade union best fitted for the further
development of the employee in public service industries as a worker
and as a citizen? Certainly many of the company unions that have
been launched in the last few years have little to commend them as
schools of efficiency or of forceful citizenship. They have been imposed
on reluctant employees by employers whose chief motive was to discourage
by this means all other forms of organization, a purpose
which has been frankly manifested in rules that on the one hand require
the employee to belong to the company union and on the other to
forswear allegiance to any and every other form of labor organization.
But along with these trade-union-smashing company unions are others
which put no limitations upon the right of the employee to belong to
other organizations but yet offer him so much more than the fighting


### ---Economics-1923-0-11.txt---
trade union can hope to offer him that they easily attract and hold
the great majority of the employees.
The limitation of the old-line trade union is that it is designed to
strengthen the power of its members to fight the exploiting type of
employer. When confronted by an employer who is really actuated
by good will toward his employees and is capable of organizing his
business so as to offer them better conditions than most of his competitors,
the trade union becomes in great measure superfluous. On
the other hand with such an employer a company union can be developed
into a powerful agency for raising the level of intelligence and
understanding of the employees, for according them a larger and
larger share in determining the conditions under which they shall
work and in preparing the way for that better industrial world which
we like to believe is in process of becoming.
The choice between the company union and the trade union as
regards this vital question as to which will develop the better worker
and citizen thus depends on the type of employer who as time goes on
is to manage our public service industries. So long as the profitseeking
exploiter type predominates, our preference must be unqualifiedly
for the fighting trade union. As the co6perative employer who
honestly regards himself as the senior partner in industry and his
employees as his junior partners becomes predominant there will be
less need for the fighting trade union and a larger field of usefulness
for the company union, as a step toward true copartnership in industry.


Our conclusions can be restated in a few words. There has been
a notable increase in the number of company unions in the last few
years and at the same time a marked decline in the membership of
trade unions.8 Company unions are better calculated than trade
unions to promote continuity, economy and efficiency of operation and
are more amenable to changes initiated by employers. Therefore
employers favor them and their associations, like the National Industrial
Conference Board, issue highly commendatory reports in regard
to their operation. They are not at all well fitted to contend
against the grasping type of employer for more favorable wages, hours
or working conditions and, therefore, trade unionists condemn them
as a delusion and a snare. In the case of public service industries the
public's vital interest in continuous operation is causing authoritative
adjustment boards to be created, standards as to wages, hours and
working conditions to be laid down by law and restrictions to be
imposed upon the right to strike. Moreover the public's automatic


### ---Economics-1923-0-12.txt---
condemnation of the side which interrupts a public service makes the
strike a boomerang. In these industries accordingly trade unions
operating along old lines are losing much of their usefulness, while the
field open to company unions is broadening. As regards the public
interest in the development of better all-round workers and citizens,
preference must be given to trade unions or company unions depending
upon the type of employer involved. The hope of the future is that
the employer actuated by good will and desiring to make the employment
relation a real copartnership in industry will become the predominant
type, and that under his leadership practicable plans will
be devised for combining national unions dealing with the problems of
general concern to all wage-earners in the industry with company
unions or shop committees for the settlement of local problems.
There is one aspect of the situation which this analysis seems to
overlook. Consciousness of the opposition of interests between employers
and employees has given vitality to the trade union, but an
even stronger cohesive influence has been the consciousness of common
interests that is causing the workers of all countries to unite even
across national boundaries. Is this growing sense of solidarity to be
eclipsed by the increasing realization fostered by company unions that
employers and employees have common interests as well as conflicting
interests? Nothing is further from my own expectation. What I
think rather is that the sense of commton interests which holds wageearners
together in trade unions will be in part transferred from the
industrial to the political field. The principal circumstance that may
render the trade union less indispensable is not any over-night conversion
of employers, but the taking over of the regulation of working
conditions in public service industries by the government. In the constitution
of adjustment boards, in the formulation of legal standards
as to working conditions, in the progressive development of social
insurance and other protective labor legislation, wage-earners will have
an ever increasing motive for concerning themselves with politics. The
United States has been relatively backward in this development but
what has happened in other English speaking countries, in the United
Kingdom, in Australia and in New Zealand, the growth of a labor party
until it has become the principal opposition party, is prophetic of what
is likely to happen here.
There is no danger that the consciousness of solidarity of interest
among wage-earners will grow weaker so long as the wage system
itself endures. What we must hope for from the changes which I have
forecast in connection with our public service industries, and this is
my last word, is that this consciousness of solidarity may be tempered
by a growing realization of our common interest in having these industries
really dominated by the motive of public service, rather than


### ---Economics-1923-0-13.txt---
by greed for excessive profits on the part of the employer or desire for
unfair advantages on the part of the employee. For it is only by
making the inspiring slogan that is justly prized by all sorts of labor
organizations, "Each for all and all for each," the slogan of our whole
industrial system that we can ever hope to solve the labor problem.

Economists have found income difficult to define. Professor Irving
Fisher in his book on The Nature of Capital and Income, published as
late as 1906, characterizes economic opinion regarding the nature of
income as "deplorably confused and conflicting."2 Professor Seligman,
writing in 1911, said: "The problem of defining income ...... is one
that almost baffles the student."' Still more recently, 1921, the staff
of the National Bureau of Economic Research said, with reference to
income statistics, that "one of the most serious difficulties in working
with these data is the difficulty of definition," and supported that statement
by propounding a long series of unanswered riddles concerning
4

income.

Yet, so far as my observation goes, most other people think they
know what income is. Many, to be sure, acknowledge difficulty in
correlating their ideas of income with the requirements of an incometax
return. This difficulty may be attributed to the peculiarities in
the statutory definition of taxable income, to the whimsicalities of a
bureaucracy, or, possibly, to a natural reluctance to pay anv tax.
For the tears which a tax incites dim the vision. But the man on the
street, until pressed to define income or sharply catechized as to whether
this or that item is income or not, is more or less amused at the suggestion
that he may not know what his income is. The testimony of a
vast preponderance of witnesses would, I imagine, be that income is a
very definite concept, of which it should be possible to frame an acceptable
definition.

Income is certainly one of the most fundamental concepts in the
science of economics and to clarify its definition, be it to ever so small
an extent, is worth while in itself. But in choosing this subject for
this occasion I have had another purpose in mind. That purpose was
to illustrate the desirability of a more intensive study than has heretofore


### ---Economics-1924-0-02.txt---
been made by economists of the time element in economics. I
hope to be able to show that one of the essential characteristics of
income is anticipated recurrence. I shall endeavor to exemplify by an
analysis of the time element in the concept of income a principle of
human conduct in matters economic which may prove to be of wide
and general significance and which, for lack of a better term, I have
ventured to call the law of recurrence. In view of the recent revival of
interest in what is sometimes called "pure theory" I need make no
apology for the somewhat metaphysical character of this law. It is
not more so than is many another law which we have accepted and
which we use daily and effectively in our work.
Professor Fetter has already pointed out that human wants are
recurrent and that income if it is to serve those wants must be recurrent.
' To this we may add that all the processes of production, together
with the costs or efforts expended upon them are also periodic
and recurrent.

It would be an exaggeration, not justifiable even for rhetorical purposes,
to say that economists have been unmindful of this law of recurrence
or of the significance of time. But I believe that something, and
it may be a rather large something, will be gained by focusing attention
still more than has already been done upon the element of time.
To guard at the start against a very probable misunderstanding it
may be well to explain that there are certain phases of time that I do
not propose to consider. I am not thinking of time in that sense in
which it was set up by Heraclitus of Ephesus as the basis of his philosophy.
To him time was suggestive merely of an eternal flux or
change. Nor do I refer to that progress in time or secular change
which is sometimes the thought behind the distinction so frequently
drawn between the static and the dynamic laws or conditions of economic
life. While time brings changes, and may mark the progress or
retrogression of civilization, what I conceive to be even more important
to the economist is that man orders his life very largely in anticipation
of that succession of events which he calls time. Thus fully aware that
he will grow hungry on recurrent occasions he strives to introduce a
similar recurrence into his provision of food. In the making of such
provision he is not merely anticipating the recurrence of appetite but
is controlled by the recurrence of the seasons, and by the all important
fact that any and every expenditure of force or of effort, whether on
the part of nature or of himself, requires time.
I have said that economists have already made important studies
based upon time. The whole theory (and justification) of interest
as it is ordinarily stated today is based on the distinction between
present and future goods or satisfactions. This explanation has been


### ---Economics-1924-0-03.txt---
accepted as a distinct advance upon that one of the older notions
which held that interest was "the reward of abstinence." Much that
was dark and mysterious in credit disappeared when Knies and Sherwood
pointed out that credit is the medium by which we relate the
future to the present. These two are examples of metaphysical studies
based on time. Another example is afforded by the recent investigations
of cycles in economic processes which aim by empirical methods
to discover, in the midst of the bewildering flux and change of time,
some of the periodic recurrences which underly economic processes.
These studies of cycles have been important not only for the fact that
they seem to justify the claim of economics to be a true or forecasting
science, but because they have given a new impulse to the study of
theory and to great improvements in our methods of research. An
exhaustive enumeration of other instances of the advantages of time
studies is not necessary, but mention may be made of the studies of
long and short periods of supply, of the velocity of the circulation of
money, of Moore's and preceding studies of meteorological cycles, of
the statistical studies of the movement of population in the sense of its
increase or diminution, and of the common distinction between time and
place values. Enough has been said, perhaps, to indicate that still
further studies, whether they be metaphysical or empirical, along the
same general lines may possibly be fruitful.
Before passing to the concept of income which I have selected as my
principal illustration I wish to suggest two other fields in which there
may be the possibility of a profitable use of the idea of a law of recurrence.
In certain parts of economic theory, notably the theory of
value, the principle of diminishing or marginal utility has been found
very helpful. It will, I believe, be found even more so if supplemented
by the principle of anticipated recurrence. The principle of diminishing
utility is stated by Professor Alfred Marshall as follows:
There is an endless variety of wants, but there is a limit to each separate
want. This familiar and fundamental tendency of human nature may be
stated in the law of satiable wants or of diminishing utility thus :-The total
utility of a thing to anyone (that is, the total pleasure or other benefit it
yields him) increases with every increase in his stock of it, but not as fast
as his stock increases. If his stock of it increases at a uniform rate the
benefit derived from it increases at a diminishing rate. In other words, the
additional benefit which a person derives from a given increase of his stock
of a thing, diminishes with every increase in the stock that he already has.6
The satiety here predicated is related to or considered as arising
at a given moment or period of time. It rests on what Marshall calls


### ---Economics-1924-0-04.txt---
mioment he has that stock or contemplates an addition to it. Now it is
well known that you can fill Professor Seager's "healthy American boy"
"to the very top" with hot cakes and maple syrup this morning only
to find that when tomorrow morning arrives he is quite ready for a
repetition. When we observe that the law of satiable wants must be
extended to include the anticipated recurrence of those wants, it becomes
obvious that the future use of a present stock or surplus comes
into the present reckoning, in a manner not sufficiently explained by
the ordinary reference to discount. To illustrate, with a given stock
of money, we may conclude that none of the various uses to which we
might conceivably put a dollar today is equal to the fun we may have
with it tomorrow. But, furthermore, the fact that we shall need a
dollar tomorrow puts a limit to the diminishing utility that we ascribe
to one today. This may help to an understanding of some of the intricate
problems of demand. It is not sufficient, for example, to show by
reference to the supply alone, that a barrel of flour can be sold more
cheaply in bulk than in ten pound lots because it costs less so to do.
It must also be shown why there is any demand at all for it in bulk
even at the lowered price per pound. If it were not for the future or
recurrent uses we would never buy of anything more than enough for
present use. By bringing the law of recurrence into relation to the
law of satiety it seems to me apparent that a more complete, if not a
fully complete, explanation of the demand for quantities in excess of
immediate use is obtained. This all too brief statement may suffice
to suggest one way in which more intensive study of the time element
may throw some additional light on the laws of demand.
May we now raise the second question, which is whether it may not
also be true that a study of the law of recurrence in production will
help to a new understanding or at least a clearer statement of the conditions
of supply? It is very generally accepted that one of the great
handicaps under which the human race labors in getting a living is that
law ordinarily referred to as the law of diminishing returns. Many
have already pointed out that this law is not confined, as was at one
time almost universally assumed, to the cultivation of land. Any
agency of production, be it land, machinery, or labor, gives a diminishing
return, or costs more to operate, per unit of output, if driven hard
or operated at a speed beyond a certain point. This is illustrated
very nicely by the now-a-days familiar facts as to the operation of a
gas engine in an automobile. Every such engine has a so-called "most
economical rate of speed" of operation. If you start slowly and
gradually speed your car up to the point of most economical operation,
a point fixed by the engineers who built it and in turn dependent upon
the strength of materials, friction, inertia and other physical or natural
laws, you pass at first through a region where there is a decreasing


### ---Economics-1924-0-05.txt---
cost per mile traveled. If, after you pass that point, you continue to
speed up and as you approach the final limit of speed you enter a
region in which you must expend more horsepower per mile run, or in
other words you get a diminishing return. The curves which engineers
set up to display the horsepower delivered by engines at different rates
of speed and which now begin to appear in the advertising pages of
periodicals, rise, up to given rate of speed, and then fall.
This is quite parallel to the results obtained in the cultivation of
land. Such is the pressure of our recurring need for food that we
cannot disregard time. We cannot wait for the accumulation of two,
three or more harvests. How much we can get in one season is the allimportant
consideration, and ordinarily we operate land at high speed
considering the state of the existing arts of cultivation. This we do
not so often do with mechanical appliances, for thanks to the excess
of power which many of them develop and to the ease of duplicating
them, we have less need to drive them at top speed, or to work them
to the limit of their capacity. It is also true that any worker who
is required or attempts to work at a speed beyond that at which his
physical powers operate at their greatest efficiency gives or receives a
diminishing return upon the effort put forth.
The relation of this to income may now be set forth, somewhat in the
form of a thesis. Income is essentially wealth available for recurrent
consumption, recurrently (or periodically) received. Its three essential
characteristics are: receipt, recurrence, and expendability. It is
wealth looked at primarily from the point of view of time. Income is
distinguished from capital in that capital is thought of as possessed,
not as being received; capital is regarded as continuting or enduring
and not as recurring; as wearing out, but not as recurrently consumed
or used to live on; and as something to be maintained in as enduring
a form as possible. Capital is wealth looked at primarily as standing
in space.

What constitutes "receiving income" and what is the criterion of
"spendability" are two very interesting matters which I may not stop
to discuss, save very brieflv, if I am to make clear in the short time
at my disposal the significance of time or recurrence as a characteristic
of income. So too I am forced to omit any consideration of the way
in which capital may emerge out of income by saving, or the manner in
which capital goods may under certain circumstances be included in
income.

That recurrence, more often expressed as regularity, is an essential
feature of income has been pointed out by many writers. But most of
them express it by saying that income is a "flow of wealth," a metaphor
which involves serious logical difficulties and overstresses the idea of
regularity or continuity. As I use it here, recurrence does not necessarily


### ---Economics-1924-0-06.txt---
imply regularity, nor of course irregularity, but merely periodicity.


It is not my intention at this time to review the many definitions of
income that are to be found in past literature. But there is one to
which I think we may profitably devote a moment's attention. It is
one that purports to be very ancient and is attributed to the very
highest authority. It claims divine origin and sanction. It is found
in the Book of Genesis (1 :29) and reads:
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a
tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
What man received under this ancient grant was the recurrent produce
of the garden. It was "to be for meat" or consumable; and
since that which was so to serve "for meat" was the seed and the fruit,
the tree, or capital, was not to be used but conserved. The ancient
chronicler's narrative seems to me to show a remarkable insight into
the true nature of income.
From the simple forms of income with which the Book of Genesis
deals or even from the later, but still ancient, notion that it consists of
"the corn on the threshing floor" or "the fullness of the wine press"
to the modern accountant's elaborate concept of income as the net
increase in the value of a proprietorship is indeed a far cry. Money
has entered in, affording us on the one hand a common denominator
for the now exceedingly various things which enter into income, but
serving on the other hand somewhat to obscure thought. For now we
have to determine whether money alone, or money and money's worth,
are income and whether things received recurrently and used but not
ordinarily measured in money are included. Thus we have Professor
Fisher who urges with convincing reasoning that true income should be
conceived of as consisting not in the money, nor in the things which
money will buy, but solely in the abstract services which property or
instruments will afford. Thus he makes true income something twice
removed from the money received. But then come the members of the
staff of the National Bureau of Economic Research who say "we do
not count as part of the National Income anything for which a price
is not commonly paid." These two recent authorities seem to stand
at two extremes.

Even before money came in there arose a great multiplication of the
things which are income. This was already true in the days when
"Adam delved and Eve span." Beside meat man early required raiment
and beside seed he now ate flesh. This we may easily ascertain
from the account of the first income tax. For is it not recorded that
Cain brought "of the fruits of the ground an offering unto the Lord,"
while Abel brought "the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof"?

Still more difficult and confusing are the interrelations of different
incomes in the complex organization of our modern society. Out of
the cup of coffee which you had for breakfast fall a multitude of drops,
each tiny in itself, contributing from your earnings to the income of
literally thousands of others. One other illustration is all that I have
time for in this connection. There was once a hard working carpenter
who had always earned good wages, but who grew old, fell sick and
eventually passed to a well-earned rest. His income stopped when he
fell sick. But at once there descended upon him a horde of doctors,
dentists, X-ray photographers, nurses, druggists, hospital keepers,
ambulance drivers, and perhaps lawyers, money lenders, and pawn
brokers and finally the priest and undertaker. Now all of these, certainly
collectively, and possibly some singly, made more income in a
short time out of the poor carpenter's misfortunes than he had earned
in many a year. Moreover the rent went on, the water company, the
gas and electric company, the coal dealer, the butcher, the grocer, the
plumber and many others continued their profitable ministrations until
he got safely away into another world.
Out of the numerable interrelationships which these illustrations
suggest and which arise in large part from the complexities of modern
economic organization, come many difficulties in any study of income.
Out of these difficulties a way has frequently been sought by
attempting to define income as the social dividend or the net products
of industry or in some similar impersonal way. It is easy to say that
income should be thought of as consisting of the useful things produced,
or even of the enjoyment to be had from using them. While
this gets away from the confusion due to money, from double counting
and from other difficulties arising from the interrelations of private
incomes, it creates in turn a number of new difficulties. For the term
income is most commonly used to designate my income, your income
and his or her income; in short, private incomes. We can, of course,
say with propriety that the public revenues from taxation and other
sources are society's income when society is thus personified. But we
are changing the ordinary connotation of the term when we speak of
any kind of summation of your income, my income and his or her income
as national or social income, for it still remains mine and yours
and his or hers and not society's at all. Income is a purely relative
term. The things which constitute your or my income are not income
at all, when considered as severed from the relationship to you or to me
which the term income implies. When for technical purposes we thus
take the word out of its traditional field we may of course give it such
a technical meaning as will best serve our purpose. But it is, in any
case, a technical or artificial meaning and good to the extent that it
serves a purpose. Thus Professor Fisher's definition is admirable if


### ---Economics-1924-0-08.txt---
the purpose is to direct attention, let us say, to all that contributes to
social welfare and is equally useful in many other ways. But, as he
very correctly points out, it will not be at all serviceable as the basis
of an income tax. The one tacitly assumed by the National Bureau
of Economic Research, despite the fact that it differs radically from
that of Professor Fisher, is nevertheless admirably designed for the
stated purpose, wlhich is to "put a value on National Income," a purpose
impossible of achievement under Professor Fisher's definition. It is
by reason of considerations like these that the present discussion is
confined to private incomes.
If economists, and possibly jurists and accountants too, have not
found it easy to frame a definition of income on which all can readily
agree, is it possible that such a definition is to be found in the incometax
laws? This is hardly to be expected. -For each such tax is either
an outgrowth of some older tax or it has had to be fitted into some
existing system of taxes and thus has been adjusted to its environment.
Differences in the framework of government and differences in the industrial
and social organization of different countries would, one
might surmise, give rise to differences in the things included in taxable
incomes. Professor Felix Fliigel recently made an examination
of all or nearly all of the income-tax laws of the world for the express
purpose of ascertaining how they defined income. He found that: "In
most of the income-tax laws in force at the present time, a definition
of income is not to be fouqnd. The net taxable income is determined
by an enumeration of taxable and non-taxable receipts."8
It has frequently been found that an excellent method of arriving
at the meaning of a term in common use is to examine the things that
are commonly included with a view of ascertaining what their common
characteristics are.
Listed by common consent under income are many and somewhat
heterogeneous things. In the first rank are: wages, salaries, and
other forms of compensation for, or the results of, personal services or
activities. These are income whether received in the form of money or
in kind. I feel safe in saying that there is rarely if ever any doubt
about their income character. In fact, they are usually regarded as
pure income unmixed with any extraneous elements. They are usually
thought of as income in whole and not in part only. They are usually
contractual receipts. But that does not seem to be what makes them
income. For not only are personal earnings obtained outside of any
fixed contractual relation considered as income, but there are, as we
shall see in a moment, other forms of income not contractual in
character. Wages and the like are also usually the result of toil.


### ---Economics-1924-0-09.txt---
But that cannot be whiat makes them income, for there are many other
forms of income for which the recipient renders no toil.
That they come in or are received is undoubtedly one of the things
that makes them income, for that is inherent etymologically in the term.
This is essential characteristic number one. But that alone is not
sufficient, for many things are received which are never counted as
income. They are regarded as usable, consumable, and expendable
(or, more briefly, spendable) in whole or in part and as something
whiclh may properly be used to live on. And this is true although
there may be very good reasons why it is wise to save a part of them
and in fact to save as much as possible. By the term spendable, it
may be well to explain, is meant that they may be used to live on without
direct impairment of one's anticipated or expected future income.
That is, spending may not interfere with recurrence. This spendability
is a characteristic which, as we shall see, is common to all other
forms of income and may thus be put down as number two of the characteristics
we are seeking. Yet this alone is not conclusive. Treasure
trove, a gift of capital, an inheritance are all likewise spendable receipts.
That is they may be spent without impairment of anticipated
future income from sources available before they were received. But,
of course, it is not considered wise to spend these, unless they are small,
but to treat them as continuing or as capital, using only the income
therefrom for spending.
Wages and salaries, also fees received in the practice of one's profession,
and any other direct personal earnings in business or in other
activities are, in almnost all cases, recurrent, or the endeavor is to make
them so. In fact the endeavor is to make them as regularly recurrent
as possible. An isolated fee, an honorarium, or a prize received on
some rare occasion is something about the classification of which as
income there is always a doubt despite the fact that it is a spendable
receipt. The doubt apparently arises by reason of the absence of
anticipated recurrence. Recurrence then is characteristic number
three. It is moreover a characteristic inextricably interwoven with
the other two.

Next in order come interest and rents, both taken in the ordinary
business sense of those terms, and perhaps definitely anticipated dividends.
These are recognized by common usage as income. The first
two, interest and rent, have in common with wages and salaries four
characteristics. They are contractual, they are receipts, they are
spendable and they are recurrent. Dividends are, of course, not in
the same sense contractual but are recurrent, spendable receipts. These
all differ from wages in that they are not in the same sense the result
of toil. They have another outstanding feature which we have not
found before. That is, they are capitalizable. They are usually regarded


### ---Economics-1924-0-10.txt---
as so assured that they have a present value which can be computed
and for which the right to have them can be sold. Since this
characteristic is entirely absent from wages it cannot be one that distinguishes
income.

Common usage would include, in income, annuities and pensions.
Indeed they are sometimes considered the most desirable form of irncome.
They are spendable, recurrent receipts. They differ from
wages, in that they are not the result of present toil. They differ from
interest, rent, and dividends in that they are in a sense the reverse of
capitalizable. That is, the actuary tells us that each recurrent payment
is in part interest and in part "return of capital."
The man on the street would doubtless add to this list a fourth
group which he describes as gains and profits. This is certainly a
most difficult group. Because, in the first instance, gains and profits
are, whether regarded as two words or as a phrase, exceedingly difficult
to define, so as to suit everybody. We need not, however, penetrate
very deeply into the fog which surrounds them. We may, since
we have found three characteristics of income common to the other
three classes which we have already examined, reverse the original
procedure and inquire whether gains and profits have these three characteristics.
It will, I think, be readily admitted that those particular
gains and profits which are recurrent, expendable receipts are the ones
about whose income character there is seldom any doubt. Thus the
gains and profits of a merchant are his income. The possible or even
probable irregularity or uncertainty which distinguishes them from
some other incomes does not seem to militate against their inclusion in
income, provided they are expected to be recurrent. The same is true
of the gains and profits of dealers in capital assets, for the lands, stocks
and bonds, houses and the like are their stock in trade. Nor do the
gains and profits of a contractor, which may recur only at long intervals,
present any great difficulty. The gains and profits of a corporation
present difficulty primarily as to whether they shall be considered
the income of the company or of the stockholders. But it is when
gains and profits lack one or two of the three characteristics of income,
or have them in less than complete form, that a question arises. The
one that is most often lacking is recurrence. Thus gains and profits
from transactions outside of one's regular vocation or line of business,
like the profit from the sale of a home, are of doubtful income character.


Possibly the greatest difficulty here arises in connection with the
increment in the value of capital assets. For sometimes capital in and
of itself appears to grow. This is usually of no economic importance,
or, as Professor Fisher has so clearly shown, growth of capital has no
salable value, unless accompanied by a growth or increase of income


### ---Economics-1924-0-11.txt---
present or future or an approach of the day when income will be received.
A fruit tree may grow ever so large in trunk and branches,
but unless the new branches bear fruit, or are expected so to do, they
are of no value. Yet it sometimes happens that the tree, or any like
item of capital, is acquired and held for a time and then sold, all for
the express purpose of obtaining the increment in value, which increment
when realized is then used as income. It may be pointed out
that in this case the increment is regarded as one of a series of receipts
obtainable by dealing in capital assets as if merchandise. In any
event it is clear that the increase in value is due to the increase in the
fruit or the income, or to the approach of the day when there will be
fruit or income, and is only a part of the present value of the
future or anticipated income.
Common usage, furthermore, requires that each of these items shall
be considered as income only to the extent that it is net. For unless
it is net it is not properly regarded as spendable. This idea is imposed
upon us by what Thomas Mun called that "noble order of Debtor
and Creditor." Any advance necessary to obtain one's income, must
be won back before the true or spendable income is known. We may
not, however, carry the mathematical equation of debits and credits to
an extreme. The consequence of so doing is illustrated by that delicious
absurdity of the National Bureau of Economic Research when
it discovered "negative income," which upon examination is found to
mean an excess of outgo over income. But the expenses of obtaining
an income are often recouped in a receipt which contains the income
as well as the return of expense and so we have that distinction between
gross and net receipts which is sometimes carelessly called gross
and net income.

Without going into details I wish here to direct attention to the interesting
fact that the only permissible deductions from gross receipts
are those which Quesnay so illuminatingly called the "advances necessary
to obtain revenue" and that these must be recurrent. Losses,
therefore, to be deductible must be recurrent. Thus if a wage-earner's
house burns down or his automobile is wrecked, he does not consider
that his income has thereby been reduced. Losses of capital which are
not recurrent are quite easily distinguishable from losses of those advances
which are recurrent in the very nature of the processes of obtaining
income.

It was stated at the outset that the term anticipated recurrence, as
I conceive of it, does not imply a flow. A goodly number of the best
authorities, and quite recently Professors Fisher and Seligman, have
defined income as a flow of wealth or services. This metaphor of a
stream suggests Newton's description of "absolute true and mathematical
time" as something which "in itself and from its own nature


### ---Economics-1924-0-12.txt---
flows equally." Now, if income (or time itself) is described as a
stream merely to facilitate certain mathematical calculations, well
and good. If "flow" is used here merely metaphorically, then, recognizing
that there are limits to all metaphors, we can raise no objections
on that score. But time, unlike a stream, has no beginning or ending,
has no bounds past or through which it flows n-or does it, like a stream,
tend to move or in any way affect the things that are immersed in it.
It must, moreover, be pointed out that time is measurable only by the
succession of phenomena, and income is measurable only by the succession
of receipts, and that periodicity and measurability are of the
essence of both. The only thing that we have to go upon in the
measurement of time is the tick of the clock, the rising and setting of
the sun or some other selected succession of phenomena. Wlhat goes
on in the interval is sometlhing we can only assume. Similarly "accrual
of income" apart from receipt of income is an abstraction based
on an unprovable assumption of regularity. The reality is the receipt
of income in instalments on recurrent occasions.
In like manner the definition of capital as a "fund" is to my mind
insufficient to distinguish it from income. The term fund as used in
this connection has been authoritatively defined by Professor Fisher
as "a stock of wealth or of property, or its value," stock being in turn
defined as "the quantity of any specified thing at any given instant."
Now a quantity of income received at a given instant is distinctly a
given quantity of a specified tlhing at that instant, whether the thing
be a commodity or the abstract services which the commodity or an
instrument yields. It is only when the quantity is thought of as continuing
in possession through a considerable period of time that it is
designated as capital and that is a concept in which space is at least as
important as time.

These are indeed fine distinctions with which I have been dealing.
Doubtless they may be regarded as unnecessarily fine in view of the
admitted excellence of the definitions of income and of capital, which
are familiar. Be that as it may, these thoughts lhave been offered in
the hope that they may show that time studies are productive, and in
the further hope that if time studies themselves become recurrent new
light may be thrown into regions that are now in darkness, and Economic
Theory may yield more income.9

"Peace is the natural effect of trade," said Montesquieu.' Not is,
but should be, said Adam Smith. "Commerce, which ought naturally
to be among nations as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship,
has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity."'
More than a century later one of the wisest of historians reaffirmed
the Scotch economist's verdict. "It is not true that the development
of material interests promotes peace. Commerce, as the messenger of
peace, is a mythological character. In its origin it was brigandage;
in ancient, mediaeval, and modern times it occasioned wars. Men
fought on the Baltic for herring, and on all the seas for spices. In
our day the growth of industry creates the question of foreign markets,
which, in turn, brings the interests of the states into conflict. Commercial
rivalry and rancor thus strengthen national hatred."'
In what measure is this a true finding? In what measure must it
remain true? These are the questions I propose to discuss. They are
difficult questions, and the literature of economics throws surprisingly
little light upon them. There appear to be two general classes or
types of opinions, and little else beside.
One view-which may be called the popular or naive view, and which
has had, I believe, few adherents among economists of standing-sees
in war one of the normal, or eveni one of the rational, economic activities
of men. National groups are pictured as behaving like the economic man
of our methodological mythologies, each consistently and relentlessly
seeking its own interests. The interests of different groups clash,
conflicts arise, and conflicts grow into war.
In one way or another this view is persistently thrust before us.
We encounter it in our newspapers, where it serves as one of the
useful stock scenarios into which even the ordinary humdrum incidents
of economic and political intercourse among nations are fitted, and


### ---Economics-1926-0-02.txt---
which give to such incidents a meaning, an element of dramatic
interest, an easily recognizable place in the general course of events.
We meet it in some of our books on international politics and in some
of our histories-particularly in those that have been written during
the last thirty or forty years. We find it in the reports by which a
country's representatives in other lands keep their own government
informed of matters which may be presumed to affect its interests.
It even has a special literature of its own-a literature which had a
mushroom growth during the war.
Such interpretations of the economic relations of nations utilize
a set of familiar concepts and phrases: commercial warfare, the
struggle for markets, the control of raw materials, surplus products,
surplus population, economic imperialism, economic penetration, and
the like. Phrases such as the struggle for (national) existence and
the survival of the fittest are also pressed into service, carrying with
them the suggestion that international economic rivalries have an
appointed place in the processes of nature.
There are two different ways of handling this apparatus of ideas.
The distinguishing characteristic of one of these methods is that
national groups are depicted as alert and intelligent personalities,
conscious of their purposes and deliberately choosing the means of
achieving those purposes. Their foreign policies are conceived in
terms of strategy, of calculated economic advantage. They are, in
short, rational, or Machiavelian, states.
The other way of dealing with this common stock of notions
employs the apparatus of historical determinism. Causes, not purposes,
rule. National policies and national destinies are shaped by
the cumulative pressure of antecedent forces. The fruits of this
particular method are a variety of pseudo-scientific dogmas respecting
the "ultimate" causes of war. I call them pseudo-scientific because,
although they borrow the mask of science, they are and must be
arbitrary and unverifiable.
Of these various dogmas the one which has had the most pervasive
influence is the Marxian. This doctrine is to the effect that changes
in industrial technique, coupled with the private ownership of those
instruments of production through which alone the fruits of technical
progress can be realized, bring about a disparity between a country's
power to produce and its power to consume. The surplus product
accumulates in the market, where it leads periodically to crises. Endeavors
to find an outlet for it lead to economic rivalries among
nations, to the exploiting of undeveloped or backward countries, to
colonial expansion, to economic imperialism, and to wars.
The rational state does not appear in this picture. Instead there


### ---Economics-1926-0-03.txt---
is the capitalistic or class state, itself only ani historical incident,
marking a certain stage in the development of economic and political
institutions. The abiding thing is the conflict of the interests of
different economic classes. Mlodern wars are undertaken to secure
the advantage, not of a niation, but of a class. The real lines of
cleavage are to be found, not at national frontiers, but in the horizontal
stratification of society.
One element in this Marxian doctrine, nanmely the notion of surplus
products pressing outward across national boundaries under military
convoy, has an especially wide vogue. Writers who do not count
themselves followers of Marx, as well as those who do, employ it as a
routine formula.

The second general class or type of opinions to which I have referred
is distinguished, not by a special emphasis upon some particular
view of the nature and purposes of the aggressive activities of states,
but by a very definite thesis with respect to the wisdom and the consequences
of such activities. If wars are waged for economic advantage,
it is held, they defeat their own purposes. So too, in general, with all
national policies designed to advance the economic interests of one
state at the expense of other states. The truth is, it is alleged, that
a nation gains by the prosperity of other nations, not by their poverty.
This general thesis, if stated with some necessary qualifications,
would be subscribed to, I think, by most economists. It was brilliantly
expounded in Mr. Norman Angell's book, The Great Illusion. If, in
the days of its first vogue, that book seemed to be given little attention
by the economists, it was not, I imagine, because they disagreed with its
conclusions, but rather because most of those conclusions seemed to
them to be fairly commonplace economic doctrines. Doubtless Mr.
Angell weakened a good case by pushing it a little too far. He gave
too little weight to the special interests (not necessarily or even
generally class interests) that may be served by a belligerent or
imperialistic policy, even when other interests, larger but more diffused,
are injured. He did not adequately distinguish between immediate
and ultimate gains and losses. But taking his argument in the large,
and leaving details aside, it would command, I believe, the general
assent of economists. Some of the policies he finds unwise are, in fact,
policies we are accustomed to disparage by lumping them together and
calling them neo-mercantilism.
Assuming that Mr. Angell and the economists are right, is there
ground for hope that, as the result of a slow process of education, the
world would become convinced that aggressive economic nationalism
is profitless? Is there reason to believe that in this event the so-called
economic causes of war would be done away with? Such hopes, we


### ---Economics-1926-0-04.txt---
may be fairly sure, would be vain. For one thing, we have learned
in other fields that progress which has to wait upon men's becoming
more reasonable is likely to be delayed indefinitely. For another
thing-and here I am done with prelinminaries and pass to one of the
central themes of this paper-there is ground for challenging the
common views of the nature of international economic competition and
of its relation to war. The facts are too complex and too much
tangled to be fitted into the concepts and formulas which we customarily
employ.

We get those concepts and formulas, for the most part, from the
market place. We use them in describing and analyzing the mechanism
of money-making, of business competition. Here we find uniformities,
rational rules of conduct, out of which we build the framework of
economic science. That reliable mechanism, the "economic man," is
merely the average man, taken in his business relations,-taken, that
is, as buyer and seller. Now, save under very exceptional conditions
the economic relations of national groups are not like those of buyer
and seller. Not since the days of the crudest types of mercantilisrn
have they been so regarded by economists.
We concern ourselves with what nations should do in order to secure
their maximum economic advantage, we take account of some of the
things they actually do, and we even venture to explain or find reasons
for certain of these activities. But unless we are the bigoted devotees
of some dogmatic philosophy of history, we do not expect that the
behavior of national groups will conform to some definite rational
rule, that it will be stable and predictable.
The values of the world of international rivalry are more like tlle
irrational values of the world of consumers' choices than they are like
the money profits and the other money incomes for which men contend
in the world of commerce. Consider such phrases as economic
dominance, empire, economic independence, a place in the sun, territorial
expansion, control of markets, freedom of the seas. These
phrases denote some of the things for which men are supposed to fight.
Each has an economic significance. And yet, what discernible relation
is there between their potency for war and their economic significance?
Their real meaning appears only when they are projected against an
historical background; but there they lose any peculiarly economic
quality, and become merged in the general picture of national prejudices
and passions.

What I am trying to say has been put more skilfully by Walter
Lippman: "How does it happen that the people not concerned in a
special interest are so ready to defend it against the world? ....The
most obvious reason is that the private citizens are in the main


### ---Economics-1926-0-05.txt---
abysmally ignorant of what the real stakes of diplomacy are. They
do not think in terms of railroad concessions, mines, banking, and
trade.... Each contest for economic privileges appears to the public
as a kind of sporting event with loaded weapons. The people wish
their team, that is, their country, to win .... Business is the chief form
which competition between nations can assume. To be worsted in
that competition means more than to lose money; it means a loss of
social importance as well .... The way to increase national prestige is
to win economic victories by diplomatic methods.... Armament is
added as an 'insurance' for diplomacy, and of course military
preparation always calls forth military preparation. Every international
incident is seen then, not on its 'merits', but in its relation to the
whole vast complicated game, forever teetering on the edge of war."'
It may be that some of the interests which arouse these belligerent
emotions and around which they cluster are the immediate or lasting
rational economic interests of different national groups. It is plain
that some of them are the real interests of particular men or particular
classes within different national groups. But, as I have said, there is
no correlation between the economic importance of these interests and
their power to rally a people to their defense. They may be wholly
factitious, and yet be potent.
There is instruction to be had from recent developments in the field
of sports. I mean, of course, intercollegiate and other inter-group
sports, in which small teams of selected competitors carry with them
into their contests the rivalries of the groups they represent. Members
of these rival groups like to absorb themselves in these conflicts by
reading about them. The purveyors of sporting news have found that
this is an appetite which can be stimulated, that the interests of persons
outside the rival groups may be engaged, and even that the number of
partisans may be increased.
They have found also that the number of competitions may be fruitfully
multiplied by bringing existing contests into new relations. An
intricate system of mythical regional and class "championships" has
been invented. Teams are ranked by the percentage of victories, by
the total scores they have made, and in various other ways. Ingenious
methods of rating the achievements of individual players have been
devised.

These artifices succeed in entrapping the interests of readers. And
they accomplish more than that. Some of these make-believe competitions
become real. The spirit of rivalrv reaches out and takes hold
of them. They supply new criteria of superiority, new symbols of
prestige. Some of them may come to be regarded as expressions of


### ---Economics-1926-0-06.txt---
inevitable "natural rivalries." The facts, however, suggest that
though there may be a vaguely circumscribed field of potential rivalries,
within that field competitive alignments are free to arrange themselves
in various patterns, while one thing or another may come to be adopted
as an emblem of success.
In the larger field of international economic rivalries group
psychology retains its characteristics. The world in which national
groups strive to realize their opposed interests is in large part a
world of man-made patterns and symbols. It is a new world, for
nations as we know them are only a few hundred years old-no older
than the new world-commerce which lhelped to bring them into being and
which remains one of the fields in which their oppositions and rivalries
feed and grow.

Among the architects of this world have been the historians. They
have played a role not unlike that of the contemporary newspaper
annalist of competitive sports. Most histories have been histories of
nations. By abstractinig the nation from the other forms which human
relations take, by emphasizing the peculiar anid differentiating elements
in a nation's institutional heritage, they inevitably deepen the
cleavages between nationial groups. Many histories have put disproportionate
emphasis upon wars. And in explaining wars they have
often put more reliance upon "economic motives" than either economics
or psychology would warrant.
"It is possible to study a multitude of histories," says John Dewey,
"and yet permit history, the record of the transitions and transformations
of human activities, to escape us. Taking history in separate
doses of this country and that,. . . .we miss the fact of history and also
its lesson; the diversity of institutional forms and customs which the
same human nature may produce and employ. An infantile logic, now
happily expelled from physical science, taught that opium put men to
sleep because of its dormitive potency. We follow the same logic in
social matters when we believe that a war exists because of bellicose
instincts; or that a particular economic regime is necessary because
of acquisitive and competitive impulses which must find expression....
We have constructed an elaborate political zoology as mythological
and not nearly as poetic as that other zo6logy of phoenixes, griffins,
and unicorns. Native racial spirit, the spirit of the people, or of the
time, national destirny are familiar figures in this social zoo. As names
for effects, for existing customs, they are sometimes useful. As names
for explanatory forces they work havoc with intelligence."5 And so,
we may add, do such names as economic motives and the economic
causes of war.


### ---Economics-1926-0-07.txt---
William James wrote a famous essay on the "The Moral Equivalents
of War." Conceivably we might speak of equivalents or substitutes
for economic antagonisms. But what we need most are substitutes for
the habitual patterns which elicit and direct those antagonisms.
Something may be accomplished, undoubtedly, by continued emphasis
upon the wasteful stupidity of most of the efforts national governments
make to secure economic advantages outside of their own territories,
although this something is not very much. But there is reason
to hope that with the increase in the number and variety of contacts
between the peoples of different countries, national antagonisms will
diminish. Not, however, that the growth of concreter forms of
knowledge, born of such contacts, can be counted upon to dissipate
our abstract notions of alien types of men and of rational but
malevolent states. The real ground for hope is rather that with the
growth of communication and of economic interpenetration, new forms
of organization will have to be devised.
Organization generally provides a mechanisl by means of which
some measure of external control can be exercised over men's activities.
But that is only a small part of its significance. Organization directs
activities as well as controls them.
The world's political organization has not kept pace with its economic
organization. Increasing interdependence asserts itself in
economic life. Raw materials, markets, borrowing and lending, trade
routes, prices, monetary and banking policies are things in which the
different peoples of the world have a joint as well as a separate
interest.

National states, each acting only for itself, are inefficient guardians
of these joint interests. Within a nation's own boundaries it manages
to bring the conflicting interests of different sections and groups into
some sort of balance and to enforce general standards and rules
governing the conduct of business enterprise. Just because there are
these rules of the game, because political organization is nation-wide,
the game itself takes on a different character, the nature and the
meaning of sectional conflict is changed. An American scholar who
has thrown a new and transforming light on our national history has
said: "We must frankly face the fact that in this vast and heterogeneous
nation, this sister of all Europe, regional geography is a
fundamental fact; that the American peace has been achieved by
restraining sectional selfishness and assertiveness and by coming to
agreements rather than to reciprocal denunciations or to blows....
Statesmanship in this nation consists not only in representing the
special interests of the leader's own section, but in finding a formula


### ---Economics-1926-0-08.txt---
that will bring the different regions together in a common policy."6
But the nation, in its larger relations, is itself a section. Outside of
its own borders its interests, real or supposed, conflict with the interests
of other nations. Here statesmanship becomes sectional leadership.
The role which the statesman finds easiest to play is often one which
is assigned to him in the popular dramatization of the facts of international
economic intercourse. His task would be harder, however, if
his countrymen insisted or expected that the foreign policy of their
own government should have the same degree of design and purpose,
the same elements of plot and strategy, that they see in the foreign
policies of other states.
There is a modern animism which imputes malign intent, not to the
forces of nature, but to personified "nations." The preposterous
myth that Pan-Germanism was a definite national policy could not have
found lodgment except in minds patterned to receive it. In a newspaper
which lies beforq me as I write, there is a short dispatch telling
that a new German company has been organized which proposes to
operate in Russia. The headline reads: "Germany Getting Grip on
Russia." Not long ago another dispatch told of a rather notable
increase of some relatively unimportant German exports to Sweden.
The headline and an introductory paragraph interpreted this ordinary
incident of trade as meaning that Germany was getting "control" of
Swedish markets. And when it is not Germany it is England or Japan
or some other country. A clipping bureau, I suppose, could supply
hundreds of such items each year. No one country has a monopoly of
these childish absurdities. Running through the pre-war files of an
important German commercial journal I found an astonishing number
of references to the "conquest" (Eroberung) of Latin America by the
United States; and that interpretation of our plans (not of our
achievements) is common in Latin American countries.
A good deal of what passes for information respecting the purposes
and activities of other nations is no better than malicious gossip. Such
is the character of some of the information which governments receive
through diplomatic channels. Bismarck said, "I have often not shown
dispatches from our representatives in German Courts in the highest
quarters, because they had a tendency to be piquant, or to relate and
give importance to annoying expressions or occurences, rather than to
foster and improve the relations between the two courts, so long as the
latter, as in Germany is always the case, was the task of our policy."'
But even when a government's policy is "to foster and improve
relations," no such censorship is possible over the open channels of


### ---Economics-1926-0-09.txt---
communication through which the people of a democracy gain their
impressions of the purposes of other states.
However slight their foundation, these impressions, like our general
views of the nature of international economic competition, help to
determine our attitudes and to shape our conduct. Fear of the power
and the purposes of American trusts was one of the reasons Germans
gave for the organization of cartels in some of their export industries.
The German cartels, in turn, figured largely in the discussions which
led to the Webb-Pomerene act of 1918,-a particularly invidious piece
of legislation, which permits in our export trade combinations of a type
that is illegal in our domestic trade, with the proviso that such combinations
shall not "restrain" the trade of or compete unfairly with
American competitors.
In a hundred other incidents where retaliation leads to retaliation,
anyone who cares to look may see part of the actual process by which
a world of gossip and of myths becomes the world of national policies.
Nothing else is possible so long as each separate state is not only the
guardian of its own interests but is also the interpreter of the interests
and purposes of other states. There is no more ground for hoping
that these types of economic friction will be done away with by changes
in the policies of separate states than there is for expecting that
armaments can be reduced effectively in any other way than by common
agreement among nations.
In certain limited fields of economic activity, common agreements
have already been reached and organs of international administration
have been established. This is notably true in respect of communications
and transport, where elementary considerations of convenmence
and economy, as well as the common interest in uniform and nondiscriminatory
rules, make agreements imperative. The advantages
of conformity are plainly visible, while there is little in nonconformity
to which even a fictitious "national interest" can be attached.
There is more significance in what has been accomplished in freeing
transit trade from duties and from unreasonable transport charges
and in creating international easements in important rivers and canals.
Here the interest of a particular state may sometimes be opposed to
the interests of other states. Taking advantage of a favorable geographical
position, it might take tribute from the commerce which
crosses its territory (as states often have in the past). There has been
an element of compulsion-sometimes the compulsion of stronger states
and sometimes the compulsion of circumstances-in the progress that
has been made in these matters. To take only one example, the provisions
relating to freedom of transit in the treaties concluded at the
end of the World War, one-sided though those provisions were, helped


### ---Economics-1926-0-10.txt---
to prepare the way for the general European agreement embodied in
the Barcelona Convention of March, 1921.
Agreements for the suppression of the use of unfair methods of
competition in international trade have been limited, for the most part,
to the protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names,
and the like. In these matters the interests of different states are not
so much joint as they are reciprocal, and they are unevenly reciprocal.
Substantial inequalities remai'n, particularly in the effectiveness with
which the provisions agreed to are enforced.
International agreements with respect to labor legislation may
possibly be regarded as tending toward fairer standards of international
industrial competition. But that is not their chief significance;
and I can do no more than mention them here. Nor can I
discuss the important preparatory work done under the auspices of
the Economic Committee of the League of Nations on commercial
arbitration, export and import prohibitions, double taxation, and other
matters.

It will be observed that few of the operative agreements which I
have discussed thus far cut deeply into what are generally deemed to
be important national interests or have come to be symbols of national
prestige. None of them, to put it concretely, has much news value.
The history of the international agreements that have sought really
to limit the scope of international commercial "strategy" has been a
record of halting achievement. Like price agreements and pooling
arrangements among business concerns, such covenants appear to
remain effective only so long as that situation serves the interests of the
more important signatories. Such was the history of the Berlin act
of 1885, of the Brussels Sugar Convention of 1902, and of the Act of
Algeciras of 1906.

In the absence of general agreements, the international economic
relations of a large part of the world have been governed by a complex
network of bilateral commercial treaties, held together and made
at all consistent and tolerable only by most-favored-nation clauses.
The system thus set up, especially in continental Europe, was unstable;
for a single important new treaty would upset things until, by the
revision of other treaties, a condition of temporary equilibrium could
again be reached. The system was uneven; for the strong states were
able to bargain more effectively than the weaker ones. In particular,
industrial states had a more advantageous position than agricultural
states. Questions of commercial policy were recurrently projected
into the field of international politics, so that they were quite commonly
discussed in terms of Machtpolitilk. Commercial treaties were regarded


### ---Economics-1926-0-11.txt---
as instruments by which a state's power could be projected across its
own boundaries.

Such a system must often have undesirable economic effects. The
present tariffs of some of the new states of eastern Europe afford an
illustration. These tariffs are much higher than the real economic
interests of those states demand. Artificial barriers set up at new
boundary lines, these new tariffs block long-established channels of
trade and hinder the economic recovery of that part of the world.
Not all the blame can be put upon the newly stimulated spirit of
nationalism. For these are bargaining tariffs. Some of the highest
duties are imposed, not upon goods which the tariff-making country
particularly desires to keep out, but upon goods which another country
desires to get in. Aimed largely at one another, these new tariffs are
an example of the wasteful futility of this method of procedure.
Commercial treaties, coupled with most-favored-nation provisions, will
gradually reduce them, but in the meanwhile the costs are heavy. And
experience has shown, I think, that tariffs made in this way generally
have an upward trend. New vantage points are sought from time to
time; special industrial interests look upon the reductions made in
treaties as ground regrettably lost; national sentiment, also, learns to
look upon concessions as retreat, so that there is a cumulative pressure
upward.

The United States has stood aloof from this system. We have held,
though not with complete consistency, to the policy of the equal treatment
of the commerce of all other nations. But the Tariff act of 1922
empowers the President to impose retaliatory duties upon imports
from any country which discriminates against our commerce; and the
same general principle was embodied in the Tariff act of 1909. We
determine the other country's guilt; and we impose what we consider
an appropriate penalty-surely an unsatisfactory way of handling the
matter.

Students of these problems have become pretty well convinced, I
think, that the most important single step toward their solution lies
in the adoption of multilateral conventions defining the conditions of
economic intercourse among the nations of the world. The filrst
principle, the irreducible minimum, in such agreements is the doing
away with a nation's power to discriminate against the trade of any
other nation. This was the meaning of the third of President Wilson's
Fourteen Points: "The removal, so far as possible, of all economic
barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions."
This, beyond doubt, is part of the meaning of the clause in the Covenant
of the League of Nations which binds the signers of that covenant to


### ---Economics-1926-0-12.txt---
and of transit and equitable treatment for the commerce of all Members
of the League.""

The League's word "equitable" is better in some ways than
President Wilson's word "equality." It does not carry with it so
clear and definite a commitment; but for that very reason it does not
suggest precise limits to the scope of international economic agreements.


In fact, the phrase, "equitable treatment for commerce," suggests
different things to men in different countries. To some it means equal,
that is, general most-favored-nation treatment. Some would add
national treatment in respect of certain matters, such, for example,
as the rights of foreign vessels in national ports, the taxes imposed
upon foreigners, or the protection given them against unfair competition.
To others it includes anti-dumping arrangements, the removal
of restrictions, on exports, unrestricted access to raw materials,
or the open door in undeveloped parts of the world. I do not intend
to weary you further by discussing these various possibilities. Just
now the content of international economic agreements is not so important
as it is that agreements should be reached.
I have already said that the more important agreements of this
general sort made before the war were unsuccessful. The difficulty with
them was that they were exceptional arrangements. Belgium in the
Congo and France in Morocco were hampered by restrictions that had
the character of special disabilities, such as had not been attached to
the colonial expansion of other countries. The Brussels Sugar Convention
was an anomaly in a world in which nations were generally left
free to determine their commercial policies as they pleased. To be
really effective, such agreements must establish a general rule, not an
exception to a rule. They must in some way create a new standard
pattern of thought and conduct.
The resolution by which a few months ago the Assembly of the
League of Nations invited the Council of the League to institute
preparations for an international economic conference referred to the
"economic difficulties which stand in the way of the restoration of
general prosperity," and expressed the conviction that "economic
peace will contribute largely to ensuring the security of peoples." As
matters now stand in Europe, these two objects, economic restoration
and economic peace, are closely connected. But of the two, economic
peace is the more important, for it is the condition of the other.
Consider what has already been accomplished toward financial
reconstruction. The real significance of the plans for the financial


### ---Economics-1926-0-13.txt---
rehabilitation of Austria, Hungary and Germany is that they embody
international agreements. The securing of these international agreements
was both a more difficult and a more important achievement
than the formulating of the particular economic remedies that were to
be administered. It is easier to determine what economic precedure is
wise than it is to change national attitudes.
In these instances the changing of national attitudes was achieved
by organizing and giving expression to the common interests of nations.
The hopelessness of other methods had to be shown before this could
be accomplished, but once done, it is not easily undone. The new
attitude creates a new interest. Even if some of its economic provisions
should break down, as is altogether likely, the Dawes plan
probably will have solved the reparation problem.
The significance of these achievements for the general problem which
I have undertaken to discuss is obvious. The attitudes and activities
which we have in mind when we speak of "the economic causes of war"
are not inevitable and unyielding expressions of permanent traits of
human nature. They are forms or patterns of conduct and are
correlated with particular modes of organization. Other forms and
patterns, associated with other modes of organization, are within the
bounds of practicable achievement. This does not mean that the task
is simple, or that it can be accomplished merely by finding a magic
formula. Nor does any sensible person expect that sectional interests
or international economic antagonisms will disappear. But it is not
unreasonable to hope that some day they may be subordinated to new
and larger interests which will grow out of new forms of organization.
At any rate, the only way to secure economic peace is to turn our eyes
toward it.

In taxation, says the cynic, "let me make the deals and I care not
who makes the ideals." How far we should go with the cynic, will be
discussed hereafter; but I think we must begin with him.
While taxation may not have started as a class struggle, and while
the class element is modified in the United States by the operation of
constitutional inhibitions, modern taxation or tax-making in its most
characteristic aspect is a group contest in which powerful interests
vigorously endeavor to rid tlhemselves of present or proposed tax burdens.
It is, first of all, a hard game in which he who trusts wholly to
economics, reason, and justice, will in the end retire beaten and disillusioned.
Class politics is of the essence of taxation.
This truth applies not only to the political game of tax-making. It
affects vitally the economist's thinking about taxation. Contest and
class politics by themselves yield neither the truth nor sound taxes. But
they are indispensable elements in discovering what is truth and sound
policy in matters of taxation. For each sound principle of taxation
laid down by the economist or statesman, the taxpayers themselves, in
bitter struggle, have brought to light a half dozen. The intellectual
interest of the aloof thinker is not enough. The creative inspiration
of contest is also needed. Clashing litigants have made more good law
than wise legislators and disinterested judges.
The truth not only emerges from contest, but the contest in part
determines what is the truth. In this domain of life and thought, the
facts are in some part what our own efforts make them. Expenditures
and revenue yields are dependent in material degree upon the resistance
of the taxpayers themselves. Tax reduction exercises a potent check
upon proposed expenditures. Fear of a deficit spurs fiscal officials to
settle old tax cases-both to pay refunds and collect back taxes with
greater promptness than would otherwise be exercised. There are over
18,000 unsettled tax appeals pending before the United States Board
of Tax Appeals, in which the government claims approximately
$550,000,000 additional taxes. Past experience shows both that there
has been harmful delay in the settlement of these cases, and that settlement
yields approximately one-half of the additional taxes claimed by


### ---Economics-1928-0-02.txt---
the government. Had we been operating in the past few years undex
real danger of a deficit, a substantial proportion of these cases would
have been cleaned up, to the great benefit of both the Treasury and the
taxpayers concerned.
The taxpayer cannot be content to let statistics determine how much
future revenues will be; he wants to have a hand in making and moulding
those statistics. He cannot permit fiscal officials to determine of
and by themselves what kinds and rates of taxes are expedient. I have
said elsewhere that it is essential to the right solution of such questions
that taxpayers pull at the coat tails of distinguished statesmen and say,
insistently, what they believe they can and ought to pay. Tax-making
is only in part a matter of thinking; it is in large part a balance of
powers and forces. The fiscal official himself has an interest at stake,
which leads him-if unchecked-to play excessively safe. Moreover,
legislators and fiscal officials make their decisions-both between expenditures
and tax reductions and between various groups of taxpayerswith
keen regard to the revealed power of the various contestants.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1927, over $1,100,000,000 of the
public debt was retired: over $500,000,000 from the sinking fund, and
over $600,000,000 from the surplus of $635,809,000 accumulated in
that year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1928, the sinking fund,
together with payments on obligations of the foreign governments, will
result in the retirement of approximately $537,000,000 of the public
debt, while the surplus will amount to $454,000,000, it is estimated,
making possible a total debt reduction approaching $1,000,000,000.
The public debt is now in the neighborhood of $18,500,000,000. Taking
into account the steady growth of the sinking fund, and the expected
increase in the payments on account of foreign obligations, the entire
public debt will be extinguished in less than fifteen years, if surpluses
appear in the future as they have in the past.
Trhe American taxpayer may ask-what then? Are we paying down
our debt at the rate of from $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 a year, in
order at the end of the process to cancel our foreign claims and exempt
the foreign taxpayer? Such a program is worthy of solemn consideration.
But it should be consciously adopted, if at all. It will do no
good suddenly to awaken to such an issue. To wipe out our debt and
then be asked to cancel the foreigners' debt to us, will lead to accusations
of deception and trickery. It will stir domestic controversy
that will complicate, and not simplify, our foreign problems.
The resistance of the taxpayer thus brings to light facts and issues
hidden in the mists of the future. It modifies those facts and issues. It
has been said of old: You shall seek the truth and the truth shall make
you uncomfortable. In taxation it may be said: You shall, in part, make
the issue and the truth, and in so doing you will be less uncomfortable.


### ---Economics-1928-0-03.txt---
I may take time at this point to express the personal opinion that
that branch of economics devoted to taxation can never be merely or
principally a science. Taxes are fixed much as wages are fixed, by the
play of competitive forces; but all sorts of collateral factors obscure
the process, and the competitive efficiency of many groups is low. You
may usually count on selfishness, but not always on enlightened selfishness.
The interests or forces whose resultant the economist seeks to
trace, vary with education, the progress of democracy, the acquisition
of political finesse and tax technique on the part of the spokesman or
representatives of such interests. As is noted hereafter, regard for
the general welfare and for sound public policy frequently exercises a
powerful influence; but this is an influence which varies greatly with
the political atmosphere, and with the character of the political leaders
who chance to be in office.
I suspect that what is true of taxation is also true of the field of
labor and other branches of economics, in which the "underlying uniformities
which the economist seeks" are vitally dependent upon the
conscious and concerted action of social groups. Political economy is
concerned quite as much with the future as with the past. Values, prices
and wages are part of the stock in trade of the economist. They depend
as much upon the probable future as on the finished past. The
economist who is rusty on statistics and history, but who guesses well
the future decline and fall of economic powers, the extent to which old
alliances will be dissolved and new alignments formed, the time in which
a federal reserve system will suppress the old and create a new variety
of financial panic, the rapidity with which birth control will arrest the
"devastating torrent of children" in Protestant and Catholic countries,
the immediate and later effects of the restriction of immigration, the
in-terval that must pass before the concerted regulation of output
is legitimized in industry as in agriculture and labor, the effect of tax
reduction in neutralizing tax avoidance and increasing the taxable basis
-he who by imagination or instinct or reason gauges well these forces
of the future, is a better economist in my opinion, than he who is master
only of the facts of the past.
History often repeats itself. But as frequently it fails to repeat. The
economist's own work sets in motion influences which modify the group
action which he studies. The popularization of forecasting, thus, has
appreciably affected the character of the recent business cycle. What
Sir Josiah Stamp has said of statistics is equally true of economic
history; they are invaluable aids to intelligence; they can never be
substitutes for intelligence. The mind may be closed as well as enkindled
and illuminated by erudition. It is necessary to know history
and statistics. It is just as necessary to know when to toss them overboard.
The disinterested mind and the passion for precision are of


### ---Economics-1928-0-04.txt---
priceless value in the calling of the economist. But they cannot of
themselves produce the broad judgmeent and wisdom which envisage the
future as well as the past, and which constitute the fruit and flower of
political economy. A political economy which is a mere science is not
enough; partly because it is an impossiblity, partly because there is
something more excellent.
The dominating factor of economic interest in taxation determines
to a large extent the role or place of idealism in taxation. Ideals are
effective when they further the economic interest of powerful groups.
The reformers who preached progressive taxation, when the weight of
authoritative economic opinion was against them, have exercised a
powerful practical influence upon the tax systems of the world, and I
have no doubt that they have won, in part because they were right, because
their proposals were sound. But the true explanation of their victory
is found in the fact that they were playing the game of democracy.
On the other hand, the idealists whose ideals ran counter to the
economic interests of the majority, have achieved few positive or visible
results. I recall few personalities in the American field of practical
economics, as powerful and persuasive as Henry George and William
Graham Sumnner. If personality and persuasiveness could put over
economic ideals in the field of taxation, the single tax and free trade
would, by this time, be live issues. I pass no verdict upon the validity
of these proposals. Sound or unsound, however, they cut little figure.
Ihey are negligible because they run counter to the interests of the
majority-or are, by the majority, supposed to do so. On the other
hand, if land ownership over large areas ever becomes concentrated in
the hands of the few, it is probable that we shall see a vigorous application
of the single-tax doctrine. If free trade ever accords visibly
with the interest of the majority, who can doubt that we shall move
rapidly in the direction of free trade? But in both cases we shall move,
not because justice or economic "science" beckons in a particular
direction, but because in that direction lies the economic interest of the
maj ority.

Thrice blessed is the idealist whose honest conviction coincides with
the visible economic interest of the majority. Doubly blessed is he
whose honest conviction coinciles with the real but, for the moment,
unrealized economic interest of the majority; he has but to awaken a
sleeping lion. Difficult but sti1 comfortable is the lot of the idealist,
whose modest task is to keep within due bounds the action of a majority
with the economic interest of which his convictions, in the main,
coincide. But alas for the idealist whose convictions call for a forthright
and conscious sacrifice of the obvious economic interest of the
maj ority.


### ---Economics-1928-0-05.txt---
Must we then swim only with the stream? Is there no place for the
sound but unpalatable truth? Has the tax economist no effective
function but that of guiding, perhaps moderating, the selfish interests
of powerful groups? Are ideals and idealism in taxation useless, or
worse than useless?

Certainly, in my opinion, the callow idealist, the jejune preachments
of the narrow-minded, are worse than useless. Idealism as a striving
after perfect truth or justice, is mostly a nuisance. It does good, but
more harm than good, if injected into practical affairs. The ideal of
a single land tax, or of a single sales tax, or of a single tax on luxuries
or expenditures, after all their repercussions and reactions are weighed,
does more to discredit the partial truth resident in each proposal than
to give due effect to that partial truth. Narrowness and restricted
vision are unforgivable sins in those who essay to guide tax thinking.
"The ends of government," said John Stuart Mill, "are as comprehensive
as those of the social union. They consist of all the good, and all
the immunity from evil, which the existence of government can be made,
either directly or indirectly, to bestow." Mill stated thus, to my thinking,
the deepest truth applicable to taxation and tax making. Its validity,
I think, is assumed by the untutored practical mind. However far
his conduct may depart from this path, the man on the street accepts it
as the true path. To obscure that path in the name of perfect truth,
or ideal justice, or economic "science," is unforgivable. In taxation
let the teacher be silent who cannot hold many objects and ends in mind
at the same time; or let him speak only of the narrow, technical problem
whose solution requires learning rather than wisdom.
Taxes are as complex as life. The moralist calls for just taxes; but
taxes cannot just be just. The administrator asks for simple taxes; but
experience shows that they cannot simply be simple. Some politicians
would mould taxes wholly in accordance with political expediency; but
statesmen realize that in the long run this would be impolitic. The business
man demands practical taxes; but financial history proves that it is impracticable
to make them merely practical. The legalist wants taxes administered
strictly according to law; but the record of the income tax and the
property tax makes it clear that such taxes cannot be successfully administered
by methods meticulously legal.
The injury done by a misplaced ideal is well illustrated in the application
of the federal income tax. The 'Ndministration of the tax is, in
many respects, deserving of the highest.praise, and it has been greatly
improved in recent months. But the app$lication of the tax to the larger
and more complicated cases in the past, has been characterized by
vacillation, delay, and demoralizing uncertainty. We are told in a recent
report by the Treasury Department:
More than 19,000 undecided cases are pending before the Board of Tax
Appeals, involving aggregate deficiencies of approximately $550,000,000.


### ---Economics-1928-0-06.txt---
The petitions being filed with the Board of Tax Appeals exceed the number
disposed of by more than 200 per month ... . It has been estimated that
the Board would be required to devote approximately four years-if no
other cases were presen-ted to it-to clear its docket. The office of
the General Counsel is literally swamped witll work.'
This situation, in my opinion, is largely (but not wholly) the product
of a misplaced and legalistic ideal which led our administrative authorities
to pattern their work on the model of American court procedure.
They have assumed, almost unconsciously, that there is in each tax
case a precisely determinable legal liability, and that every disputed
point, to be decided rightly, must be finally decided by the Supreme
Court of the United States. In all this we are worshiping false gods.
In tens of thousands of income tax cases there is no precisely determinable
legal liability; and the income tax turns up new questions in
such volume that no system of courts could ever possibly decide them.
In this work we need less striving after ideally exact judicial interpretation,
and more appreciation of the bewildering subtlety and overwhelming
volume of the work to be done. We need to see that the
application of a complicated direct tax, calling for the annual assessment
of millions of taxpayers, is a wholesale job, and cannot be
conducted after the manner of a lawsuit; that a prompt-indeed, in
many cases an adva-nce-decision of disputed points better serves the
ends of justice than a procedure of protracted appeal. As the Treasury
report, from which I have already quoted, very cogently says: "The
collection of revenue is primarily an administrative and not a judicial
problem. As far as the federal income tax is concerned, a field of
administration has been turned into a legal battlefield."
While superficial idealism and unassimilated ideals are mischievouLs,
there is deep need and, fortunately, a growing place in taxation, for the
mind that seeks truth and the general, as opposed to the special, good.
As I have recently said elsewhere, self-interest is the dominant but
not the sole motive in taxation. The first impulse of a healthy human
being, when threatened with a tax, is to resist. But to resist successfully,
the individual must work in and with a group; and insensibly the
raw, egoistic impulse which first animated him is changed to a group
impulse, which accepts group standards and a group ethic. Individual
selfishness is profoundly modified by class selfishness, and in time the
latter may, and often does, change to something higher. The guiding
light frequently becomes social, or national, in its range. The greatest
good of the greatest number replaces "my good, and that of my class."
A sense of general equity, of fair play, of broad social policy is
awakened and plays a powerful part. Disinterested students of


### ---Economics-1928-0-07.txt---
economics and government assume roles of importance in the political
arena where taxes are made and unmade. Tax making rises above
what the war aviators called "a dog fight."
Tax-making is, accordingly, something better than a whirling battle
of jarring sects and factions, in which considerations of equity and
sound public policy are wholly lost to view. The great number of interests
at stake and the very complexity of the fight sweeten it. There
are so many issues that with respect to many of them, a majority of
legislators and voters are unaffected and disinterested; they may cast
their votes as a more or less disinterested jury. There are thus many
important tax problems which may be settled on the broad basis of
equity and sound public policy, if one is wise and ingenious enough to
find the right solution. Here, patient research and the disinterested
mind find wide scope for their beneficent service.
Federal tax laws in recent years have been profoundly influenced by
the Legislative Counsel of the House and Senate. These men have
striven with undeviating aim to write into law the will of Congress; but
in the many important technical matters which have so frequently, in
practice and effect, been left to their discretion, they have sought trulth
and even-handed justice with a tireless devotion, which is beyond adequate
praise. Or to take another illustration: the Secretary of the
Treasury and important members of Congress who could be named, have
repeatedly in recent years fought for tax measures which they knew at
the time were foredoomed to failure. They knew the efficacy of reiterated
enunciation of the sound but unpalatable truth.
The shallow sentimentalism of the parlor idealist and the narrow zeal
of the fanatical idealist, result in little good and much harm in the field
of taxation. But the work of those who serve with humility as well as
zeal the cause of truth and justice, counts mightily. The arm of the
enlightened tax officicil slackens when he is called upon to enforce tax
laws which conflict with his sense of equity. The natural opposition to
progressive taxation of the very wealthy-one of the powerful tax
groups to which I have alluded-is moderated and frequently overcome
by prevailing doctrines of equity and sound public policy, in the
creation of which economists and disinterested students play a most
important part. In the adoption of tax legislation there come zero
hours, when the zeal of the narrowly selfish flags. At that time the
apostle of the broader, deeper, and less popular truth gets his chance.
American tax laws contain not a few beneficent provisions traceable to
some tireless lobbyist for the public good.
The disinterested fiscal truth exercises, then, a real influence. Its
action is largely critical, negative, and indirect, but it is pervasive and
powerful. The truth is mighty, even though, from my limited experience,
I see no reason to believe that it will prevail.

Among other and conflicting dictionary definitions of the word
"ideal" one finds this: "a standard of desire; an ultimate object or
aim, a mental conception of what is most desirable." Are such ideals
helpful in the field of taxation?
My experience, I confess, has led me to distrust even such ideals,
attractive though they may be to the scholar or ambitious statesman.
Laissez-faire; the socio-political ideal of Adolph Wagner; capital accumulation
as seen by Ricardo; conscription of capital as advocated by
idealistic economists at the beginning of the war; or "work and save"
so confidently proclaimed in the years immediately following the warwhat
sorry and discredited pole-stars they are! Life's real economic
objectives are infinitely more subtle and lie infinitely beyond such proximate
stars, even if they be stars.
This I do believe: The world needs the economist's version of the
truth when it is fashioned after mature study. But let the economist
cherish no illusion that it will prevail; that belief is merely a bit of
intellectual arrogance with which the scholar quiets the growling of his
own particular form of inferiority complex. The economist's "truth"
is only one factor in the contest we call taxation. He little knows when
he launches it, on what side it will eventually fight, or in what unsuspected
ways and places it will count and tell. Wearing the white
armor of "science," it will fight side by side with grimy forces seeking
their own so-called selfish ends. It will emerge from the contest a
battered and a better truth. It will have gained from, as much as
it will have given to, its fellow contestants. It will have proved to be
no better and no holier than many of its fellows. It will have proved
more effective, the more completely its author-the economist-recognized
in advance its limitations, its functions, and the character of the
other contestants.

Contest is not oirly inevitable, but essential in the determination of
economic truth. There is no true political economy which does not
contemplate action. Thinking is only the beginning of wisdom; action
is essential to its consummation. The economist's "truth" as it emerges
from the closet, is largely hypothesis. It must be refined and tested in
the laboratory of life. The complete economist will have taken his part
in tax-making and have felt the buffeting of the game. He will have
done this not only as citizen and man, but as economist. True wisdom
cannot be purchased at a lesser price. Without it he may possibly be
a statistical or social scientist, but he can never be an economist in the
field of taxation.

Like most teachers of economic theory, I have found it quite worth
while to spend some time studying any particular problem in hand from
the standpoint of a socialist state. In fact I have more than once found
it profitable to work out, from that standpoint, a quite specific solution
of the problem in question-setting up as the proper criterion of
a sound solution that it should seem entirely reasonable in view of the
essential nature of a socialist state. Tonight, I am applying this
method of procedure to a very fundamental problem of any cooperative
economic order, that is, the problem embodied in this question: What
is the proper method of determining just what commodities shall be
produced from the economic resources at the disposal of a given community
?

Under the present economic order of free private initiative, the actual
decision as to what commodities shall be produced is made very simply.
First, on the basis of a vast complex of institutions, customs and laws,
the citizen adopts a line of conduct which provides him with a money
income of greater or less volume. Secondly, that citizen comes on the
market with said income demanding from those persons who have voluntarily
assumed the role of producers, whatever commodities, he, the
citizen, chooses. Thirdly, the producers promptly submit to the dictation
of the citizen in this matter, provided always that said citizen
brings along with his demand entire readiness to pay for each commodity
a price equal to the cost of producing that commodity. In the
case of a socialist state, the proper method of determining what commodities
shall be produced would be in outline substantially the same
as that just described. That is, the correct general procedure would
be this: (1) the state would assure to the citizen a given money income
and (2) the state would authorize the citizen toE spend that income as
he chose in buying commodities produced by the state-a procedure
which would virtually authorize the citizen to dictate just what commodities
the economic authorities of the state should produce.


### ---Economics-1929-0-02.txt---
This paper, taken as a whole, is a defense of the method of guiding
production in a socialist state which was just described. But that
defense really breaks into two parts. The first part is used in making
the direct defense, that is, in setting forth the specific reasons why that
method is essentially sound. The second part will be used to deal with
a subordinate problem, that is, a problem which would have to be solved
by the authorities before the plan for guiding production here advocated
could be followed. The specific nature of this subordinate problem
will be more easily brought out a little later.
So much for the two tasks with which we are to deal in this paper.
But, before starting upon those tasks, we must take a moment to explain
just what meaning will attach to the phrase "socialist state" as
used in this paper. A state so designated is here understood as being
one in which the control of the whole apparatus of production and the
guidance of all productive operations is to be in the hands of the state
itself. In other words, the state is to be the sole responsible producer,
that is, the sole person natural or legal who is authorized to employ
the economic resources of the community, its stock or income of primary
factors, in producing commodities. As such sole producer, the
state maintains exchange relations with its citizens, buying their productive
services with money and selling to them the commodities which
it produces.

I

Keeping in mind this conception of a socialist state, we must now take
up our first task, that is, the task of defending the proposition already
laid down that, in a socialist state, the proper method of determining
what commodities should be produced would be to assure each citizen
a money income and then to authorize that citizen to call on the state
to produce the particular commodities which he the citizen-wanted.
Here our first step must be to note some details which would be included
in our plan. In the first place, when we describe the proper method
of determining what commodities shall be produced as being a method
which begins by assuring to each citizen a certain money income, it is
of course assumed that said income is assured to the citizen only with
the proviso that certain conditions fixed by the state have been fulfilled.
Just what these conditions ought to be we must not take time to consider;
but, that conditions of some sort should be attached to the receiving
of an income cannot be questioned.
Another detail of our plan which is assumed is that, in determining
the money incomes to be conditionally assured to the citizens of a socialist
state, the authorities of such a state would have honestly and earnestly
endeavored to fix those incomes so that they represent that distribution
of the total income of the state which was called for in the interest


### ---Economics-1929-0-03.txt---
of citizens generally and of the group as an organic whole.
This socially correct system of incomes being assumed, it necessarily follows
that the judgments reached by citizens with respect to the relative
importances of different commodities would be virtually social judgments,
and the resulting commodity prices would be prices which expressed
the social importances of commodities.
A third specific provision which is assumed to be present in the socialist
plan for determining what commodities to produce is this: In
deciding whether or not to demand the production of a particular commodity,
the citizen must have before his mind just what price he would
be obliged to pay for that commodity. Such a provision would be indispensable,
since the citizen would not be able to reach a decision as
to whether or not he wanted to buy a given commodity, unless he had
before him the data necessary for comparing the desirability of said
commodity with the drain on his income which the buying of that commodity
would involve.

The last specific provision of the correct socialist plan for dealing
with our problem would be this: In fixing the selling price of any particular
commodity, the economic authorities would set that price at a
point which fully covered the cost of producing said commodity, and
those authorities would understand the cost of producing that commodity
to be the drain on the economic resources of the communityits
stock or income of primary factors-consequent upon producing
said commodity.

As the particular procedure brought out in the last sentence plays an
essential part in making the plan for guiding production advocated in
this paper the right plan, I must add here two or three comments.
First, by the phrase "primary factors" is meant those economic factors
of production behind which the economist does not attempt to go, for
example, the land itself; the water powers; the original raw materials
such as metallic ores; the different kinds of labor services, etc.
Again, by the phrase "effective importance" I mean the degree of
importance which is a resultant of the whole situation, particularly of
the generic importance of the factor in question and the quantity of it
available. Put in another way, the effective importance of anything is
that degree of importance which we should take into account in deciding
how to act. Thus, a man sitting beside a floiwing well has no occasion
to economize in the use of water; and so in this situation water
to him has no effective importance. To the same man, however, if temporarily
lost in the desert with his whole stock of water reduced to a
single quart, the utmost possible economy in the use of water would be
imperative; and the effective importance of his stock of water would be
beyond estimate.


### ---Economics-1929-0-04.txt---
A third comment needed here is that every one of these numerous primary
factors has its own particular degree or amount of effective importance
in the vast complex of productive processes in which it participates.
That effective importance of each primary factor is derived
from and determined by the importances of the innumerable commodities
which emerge from that complex of productive processes. Because the
effective importances of the commodities are expressed in terms of
money value, the importances of the several factors will be so expressed.
At present it will be assumed-to prove this assumption will be the task
of the second part of this paper-that the authorities of our socialist
state will have proved able to ascertain with a sufficient degree of accuracy
these effective importances or values of all the different kinds
of primary factors, and that they will have embodied the results in
arithmetic tables which I shall usually designate factor-valuation tables.
In order to determine the cost of producing any particular commodity,
let us say a sewing machine, it would be necessary to multiply the valuation
of each factor used in producing that machine by the quantity
of that factor so used and add together these different products. If
the resultant total turned out to be thirty dollars, we should have to say
that the producing of the sewing machine made a drain on the community'
s economic resources of thirty dollars; or, in other words, that
its resources-cost was thirty dollars.
I must not leave this matter of cost in a socialist state without remarking
that the kind of cost just explained, resources-cost, is in fact
very closely allied to what, under our system, is often called expensecost.
Indeed, a very good case can be made for the contention that,
in the present order, these two kinds of cost are essentially the same
thing, though capable of being looked at, and labeled, from two quite
different points of view. To the voluntary producer of our present
order, who must buy the factors which he uses to produce a sewing
machine, the thirty-dollar cost of producing that sewing machine is an
expense-cost. On the other hand, to the economist who believes that
the automatic working of competition gives to each primary factor a
price which expresses with sufficient accuracy the effective importance of
that factor in the productive process as a whole,-to him, that same
thirty-dollar cost presents itself as a resources-cost, a drain on society's
economic resources of thirty dollars.
So much as to the general character and the specific details of the
plan for determining what commodities shall be produced which I hold
to be the only right plan for a socialist state to adopt. I must now
take a few moments to argue for the soundness of the plan. In the
first place, the plan in its general outline is surely the one which should
be maintained in a socialist state. That is, (1) the state should determine


### ---Economics-1929-0-05.txt---
the money income of the citizen; and (2) the citizen should dictate
to the state what shall be produced in return for that income. The
former provision would insure that the interests of citizens generally
would not be sacrificed to the interests of particular individuals; the
latter provision would insure that the peculiarities of tastes and needs
characteristic of each individual would not be sacrificed to some standard
of consumption set up by an all-powerful state.
I have argued that the proposed plan for guiding the production of
commodities in a socialist state, viewed in its general outline, is essentially
sound. As respects the more specific provisions of that plan,
which I have enumerated, I shall pass by the first three as needing no
defense, and take up at once the fourth, which is the provision that the
authorities of our socialist state, in fixing the price to be paid by the
citizen for any particular commodity, ought to set that price at a point
which covered completely the cost of producing that commodity and
that said authorities ought to interpret the cost of producing a given
commodity to be its resources-cost, the drain on the community's store
or income of primary factors which resulted from producing a unit of
said commodity. Is this doctrine sound? Would it really be the correct
thing for the authorities to fix the selling price of any commodity
at cost in this sense?
To this question, the affirmative answer is surely the right one. A
single consideration is decisive: That price which equals resourcescost
is the only price which would be consistent with the income system
supposed to have been already decided upon. That system, we remember,
gives to each citizen a determinate money income to be employed
as he sees fit in buying commodities from the state. But, since substantially
all commodities which the citizen is permitted to buy, that is,
consumption commodities, have to be produced, the authorities of the
state, in deciding that a particular citizen shall have a certain money
income,-one, let us suppose, of two thousand dollars,-have thereby
virtually decided that said citizen shall have an incontestable claim upon
two thousand dollars' worth of the productive resources of the state;
and that proposition, in turn, means that said citizen shall have an
incontestable right to dictate to the economic authorities just what
commodities they shall produce from his two thousand dollars' worth
of the productive resources of the community. From this reasoning it
necessarily follows that the authorities could not consistently make the
selling-price of our hypothetical sewing machine greater than its resources-
cost of thirty dollars; since doing so would in effect reduce
the money income of the citizen interested, though it had previously
been decided that said money income was just what it ought to be. On
the other hand, it is equally evident that the authorities could not


### ---Economics-1929-0-06.txt---
consistently make the selling price of the sewing machine smaller than
its resources-cost of thirty dollars; since doing so would in effect increase
the income of the citizen interested, though, by hypothesis, that
income was already just what it ought to be.
II

In the preceding discussion, we have completed our main task, that is,
the task of defending that method of procedure which I have set up
as the only proper one to be followed by the authorities of a socialist
state in deciding what commodities to produce. In the course of that
discussion it has probably become sufficiently evident why it would be
necessary for the authorities of our socialist state to solve the so-called
problem of imputation, that is, the problem of ascertaining the effective
importance in the productive process of each primary factor. Without
that information, those authorities would manifestly be unable to compute
the resources-cost of any particular commodity; hence would be
unable to determine the correct selling price for that commodity; and,
consequently, would be unable to make use of the particular method of
determining just what commodities they ought to produce which, according
to the contention of this paper, is the only correct method.
But not only would it be necessary for the authorities of a socialist
state to solve this imputation problem as a prerequisite to the employment
of this particular method of guiding production, it is not unlikely
that more than one economist would question the possibility of solving
that problem at all under the conditions necessarily prevailing in a
socialist state. I seem called on, therefore, to give a few moments to
show that, in fact, the socialist authorities would find themselves quite
equal to this task.

The particular method of procedure which would seem most suitable
for dealing with this problem in the case of a socialist state is a form of
the so-called method of trial-and-error, that is, the method which consists
in trying out a series of hypothetical solutions till one is found
which proves a success.
As a necessary preliminary to the explanation of the process by
which the method of trial-and-error could be used to solve the imputation
problem, we must remind ourselves that at any particular time the
stock or income of each primary factor which was available for the
current production period would necessarily be a substantially determinate
quantity. Unless the available quantity of any factor was thus
determinate and at the same time so limited that its total was smaller
than the need for that factor, though it might be a factor of producion,
it could not be an economic factor, and so could not be one of
the factors with which we are concerned.


### ---Economics-1929-0-07.txt---
Now, setting out from this assumption that the quantity of any economic
factor which is available for any particular productive period
is substantially determinate, I shall assume that the authorities of our
socialist state, in trying to ascertain the effective importance of each
primary factor, would adopt the following procedure. (1) They would
set about constructing factor-valuation tables in which they gave each
factor that valuation, which, on the basis of much careful study, they
believed to be the nearest approximation to its correct valuation which
they could work out in advance of experience; (2) they would then proceed
to carry on their functions as managers of all productive operations
as if they considered the valuations given in their provisional
tables to be the absolutely correct valuations; (3) while thus acting,
they would after all keep a close watch for results which would indicate
that some of their provisional valuations were incorrect; (4) if such
results appeared, they would then make the needed corrections in the
factor tables, lowering any valuations which had proved too high, raising
any which had proved too low; (5) finally, they would repeat this
procedure until no further evidence of divergence from the correct
valuations was forthcoming.
I hardly need say that the crucial stage in the above procedure is
the third, that is, the stage during which the authorities would be on
the watch to discover one or more indications that some of the valuations
which they had put into the provisional tables were wrong-were
too high or too low. Here the all-important question is this: Is it
reasonable to expect that such indication would be forthcoming whenever
particular factor valuations actually were too high or too low? The
correct answer is surely an affirmative one. If, in regulating productive
processes, the authorities were actually using for any particular factor
a valuation which was too high or too low, that fact would soon disclose
itself in unmistakable ways. Thus, supposing that, in the case of a
particular factor, the valuation given in the provisional factor tables
was too high, that fact would inevitably lead the authorities to be
unduly economical in the use of that factor; and this conduct, in turn,
would make the amount of that factor which was available for the current
productive period larger than the amount which was consumed
during that period. In other words, a too-high valuation of any factor
would cause the stock of that factor to show a surplus at the end of
the productive period. If, now, we reverse our hypothesis and suppose
that the valuation of a particular factor which appeared in the factor
tables was too low, that fact would inevitably lead the authorities to
be too lavish in the use of that factor; and this conduct, in turn, would
result in making the amount of that factor available for the current
productive period smaller than the amount needed during that period


### ---Economics-1929-0-08.txt---
at the too-low valuation. In other words, a too-low valuation of any
factor in the tables would be certain to cause a deficit in the stock of
that factor. Surplus or deficit-one or the other of these would result
from every wrong valuation of a factor.
From the above analysis it seems certain that the authorities of our
socialist state would have no difficulty finding out whether the standard
valuation of any particular factor was too high or too low. And this
much having been learned, the rest would be easy. Those authorities
would now proceed to lower valuations which had proved too high and
raise those which had proved too low. Finally, they would have no
difficulty repeating this process until neither a surplus nor a deficit appeared,
when they would rightly conclude that the valuation which was
then attached to any particular factor correctly expressed the effective
importance of that factor. It follows that we can now feel assured that
said authorities would be able to compute the resources-cost of producing
any kind of commodity which the citizen might demand. But, since
the doubt on this point formed the principal ground for questioning the
soundness of the main contention of this paper, I find myself disposed
to affirm rather dogmatically that, if the economic authorities of a
socialist state would recognize equality between cost of production on
the one hand and the demand price of the buyer on the other as being
the adequate and the only adequate proof that the commodity in question
ought to be produced, they could, under all ordinary conditions,
perform their duties, as the persons who were immediately responsible
for the guidance of production, with well-founded confidence that they
would never make any other than the right use of the economic resources
placed at their disposal.

If the shoemaker is well-advised to stick to his last, the learned professions,
which in our day have inherited much of the medieval craftsman'
s ethics, may occasionally obey this precept. I may properly, therefore,
on this occasion make some random observations upon historical
records, the raw materials of my craft. Practically all the great variety
of records used by historians in general are also necessary to the economic
historian; and his technique in the use of these records is that
common to all historical criticism. But this branch of history has
chosen for its field that longitudinal section through the great mass of
material which is concerned primarily with economic activities and relationships.
Since the economic historian is vitally interested in the
past development of economic institutions and processes and their bearing
on present problems, he must also regard his work as a branch
of the science of economics. Fundamentally important, however,
as the economic factor appears to him, he does not regard it as the one
determining factor in human affairs past or present. Man does not
live by bread alone. And no active group of economic historians is
today making any such claim for the predominance of this specialism
as did the German "historical school," from Roscher and Hildebrand to
Schmoller.


### ---Economics-1930-0-02.txt---
The leaders of the "historical school" inevitably had to err by excess
of zeal in order to make their contribution in establishing the principle
of relativity; no longer can anyone proclaim, as did the Manchesterists
of the mid-nineteenth century, that free trade is a doctrine
eternally valid and universal in its application. The economic historian
of our time realizes that the problems, economic and social, which confront
us are much too complex and difficult to be understood by any
one-sided approach. The co6peration of every usable method is required;
and the critical method of history, emphasizing sequential relationships,
is one among several essential tools. Like the physical
sciences in their modern interlocking, the social sciences are borrowing
from one another both tools and workers.
The historical investigation of prices now being launched, with the
aid of a substantial grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, involves
such collaboration. This history of prices, including wages, from the
earliest fairly continuous records to that point, differing of course in
each country studied, where the various price series may be linked with
those in current statistical use, is to be carried on by scholars from
England, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the United States, under
the chairmanship of Sir William Beveridge. Within the next five
years, the establishment of long measures of price-changes in these
countries may be expected. It is hoped to document these more fully
and make them more reliable than was possible with those produced by
such pioneers, working single-handed, as Thorold Rogers, d'Avenel, or
Wiebe. Price records will be sought which are continuous for one locality
or for homogeneous market areas. Basic price series, thus set
up, may of course be combined to show larger regional or national
averages; but the totals will not conceal the divergent weightings of
different regional price levels. A uniform general plan will be followed,
including a careful reduction of the numerous local variations in weights,
measures, and coinage, so that some approximation may be miade to
international comparisons-a procedure of especial importance, for instance,
in studying the geographical dispersion of price-changes as the
great wave of the sixteenth-century price revolution spread from Spain
over Western Europe. By separating and comparing the various
groups of prices, new light may be cast on long-time changes in the
behavior of prices and on the effect of such changes upon the attitudes
and positions of great social groups of the population at successive
periods. The investigation will require not only the association of
scholars from the several nations selected, but also the close co6peration
of a number of workers in different fields, especially of historians, archivists,
economists and statisticians. When once this relatively dependable
causeway has been thrown over the morasses of earlier economic


### ---Economics-1930-0-03.txt---
history, we shall have greatly lengthened, though on a narrow front,
our statistical base-line, now so short.
But, happy as are the economic historians over this opportunity for
the improvement of their one possible long statistical measure, they
realize fully how imperfect their best efforts must leave it. For the
causeway will be very narrow, and at places badly broken. Even with
the cautious piecing together of much more material than has hitherto
been available, serious gaps and deficiencies in the historical record must
inevitably remain.

Although always aware of the serious deficiencies in all the records
upon which he is dependent, the historian, by reason of the requirements
of continuous narrative, usually fails to convey to the reader
the full meaning of this imperfection. Absence or scarcity of records,
often at vital points and over considerable spaces of time, is the most
obvious and distressing of handicaps. But continuously baffling is the
qualitative inadequacy of the material, its inherent and shifting biases,
even when, as in the most recent centuries of history, the volume of
records increases enormously. The rise of modern states and of centralized
governments resulted in an immense increase of paper-work and
the gradual organization of state archives, where there are housed and
prepared for use great collections of political, administrative, and
judicial documents. The invention of the printing press brought a flood
of books and pamphlets; and, by its help in making men literate, brought
forth new stacks of writings, private in character, to bless and to harass
the historian. To curse with Carlyle this Dryasdust accumulation, or to
wish that the multitude of men had remained voiceless, is inadmissible.
Instead, the crushing task is divided and subdivided by shorter periods
and narrower topics; but the increasing division of labor has not lessened
the most crucial difficulties.
This very defectiveness of the raw material of his craft has largely
determined and limited the method and aim of the historian. Historical
technique, higher criticism, interpretation amounting to interpolation,
what are they in the main but methods and practices of filling gaps and
correcting biases? History has sometimes been severed from the other
social sciences by limiting it to the peculiar function of describing the
unique occurrence. Some go so far as to assert that this function forever
debars it from any attempt at the comparisons, classifications and
generalizations which characterize a science. May it not be truer to
say that the consciousness of defective material and the consequent
hypertrophy of critical talent has tended at times to check the human
craving for synthesis? The wary historian, taught and teaching the
dangers of historical analogies, has tried to limit his professional risks;
but he is increasingly minimizing those risks. In our modern historical


### ---Economics-1930-0-04.txt---
studies a rough series of transitional forms may be traced between the
two poles of research, between the narrative of the individual sequence,
especially characteristic of political history, and the emerging science
which essays, by the comparative method, the discovery of the laws or
continuities of group action. There must be and must remain the
detailed description of the single specimen, the individual sequence.
The art of historical narrative will not die. But, as with the aid
of all the kindred social sciences, the records become more adequate
and their interpretation more penetrating, history, or rather some
branches of the craft, may approximate an historical sociology. The
interdependence of the sciences is already exhibited in the use which the
social historians, as well as the political scientists, are beginning to make
of statistics, or at least in the demand for training which will enable
them to check quantitatively their descriptive studies.
L. P. Namier's recent book on the structure of English politics at the
accession of George III is an example of this use of statistics. Despairing
of gaining fresh insights from the accustomed sources, such as the
gouty bon mots of Ihorace Walpole's letters, or the acrid outcries against
the nabobs, or the mutual diatribes of parties against the corruption
practised by opponents, Mr. Namier undertook the compilationa of a
card-index containing the fullest details, especially from local records,
family and local correspondence, concerning every member of the House
of Commons from 1760 to 1783. After years of this minute inquiry,
he has published this notable initial study. His text is shot through
with numerical tests of such problems as the extent of aristocratic influence
upon the representative system, or how much voting power was
exerted by the new wealthy class, or the weight of the Crown and Administration
in elections, or the supposedly prevalent corruption of the
electorate.

As each generation thus rewrites its history of the past-a proceeding
necessary because of defective records and because of the shifts
in selective interest and in the configuration of contemporary biasessome
of the gaps in the record become partially filled. But no amount
of research or tenable conjecture can eke out the most serious silences
of our sources. This is particularly true in certain fields of economic
bistory. Such institutional structures as the open field system, the
craft gilds, or the factory, which have left behind them a record of
customary regulations or external legislation, have, like the skeletal
forms of zo6logical species, deposited their fossils in the historical strata.
But the more dynamic elements, like the vital organs and the nervous
system, have tended to disappear. We can with considerable accuracy
reconstruct these economic institutions in what we may term their skeletal
form; but how and why they came into being, what animating forces

actuated them in their prime and gradually ebbed in their decline, are
questions not easy to answer from our materials.
Take, for a simple instance, the flow of trade as a formative influence
on industrial institutions. Of foreign commerce, its agents and carriers
and its extent, we have, for the pre-statistical period, some fragments
of information; but for local or domestic trade the material is
almost hopelessly inadequate. Very difficult and elusive is also the
study of past changes in the standards of living. The record of economic
history is therefore unevenly weighted, tempting us to stress successive
stages of production and to neglect the dynamic factors of distribution
and consumption.' Even our current statistical record is notably weak
on domestic trade, and the analysis, statistical and other, of the assumptions
underlying the demand curve is inadequate. We shall have
in 1930 the first national enumeration of the agencies and amounts of
market distribution; and this will be warmly welcomed by economists
for the help it may give at this much needed point.
But why should a busy world produce statistics for the delight of
economists? We are told that economists are a voracious species, greedy
for figures, only to be satisfied when census-takers and social psychologists
stand beside the remaining third of the working population. By
implication, we should be satisfied with the existing notable increase in
our equipment for economic and social measurement since the World
War. Nearly all the departments of the federal government are busy
turning out statistical tables in growing volume, but as yet too little
co6rdinated.

Numerous state, regional and local agencies are doing likewise. Trade
organizations, university research bureaus, independent institutes, private
investigators fill the country with questionnaires and statistical publications.
And still further plans for quantitative research, nation-wide
and local, are constantly emerging. Is not all this more than enough,
asks the business man? The economist answers with an emphatic negative.
Our modern world stands but at the threshold of the "statistical
period" for which the meager but gradually accumulating statistical
I Thorold Rogers had a naive habit of treating his hypotheses as facts. Hewitt's
study of medieval Cheshire records has recently shown up this foible. Rogers
first expressed doubt regarding Cheshire's medieval salt production, a commodity of
prime importance, and thereupon he converted the doubt into a flat denial. This bald
assertion was apparently based on the absence of Cheshire salt from the record of
price quotations. But Hewitt's researches (cf. H. J. Hewitt, Medieval Cheshire,
1929, pp. 108-112) make it evident that the Cheshire brine springs were continuously
worked and that, though the data in regard to distribution are very scanty, the
number of recorded salt-houses far exceeded the needs of local consumption. In other
words, the strata of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries show plenty of skeletal
forms of production; but the evidence as to the considerable trade which created them
was never recorded or has almost vanished.


### ---Economics-1930-0-06.txt---
records of the pre-war century formed merely the initial and preparatory
stage. We are far from the saturation point of supply; and the
demand is unappeased.
This quite modern craving for exact knowledge of economic and social
institutions and processes is a definite symptom of the advent of a
new historical era, which was ushered in toward the last quarter of
the nineteenth century by a definite reaction against the regime of
unfettered, individualistic, secretive competition. Urgent social need,
felt a century earlier in Western Europe and in the regions within its
radiating influence, had unleashed the individual, long straining for free
activity; and this release in turn had stimulated the demand for ever
more intense production. The world witnessed an unrivalled outburst
of industrial energy, an unprecedented movement of migration, an age
of unexampled magnitudes and speeds. The spurt of initiative was assisted
by a new theory and a resulting policy, in law and economicsrationalistic,
hedonistic, individualistic, and dogmatic-which, with the
clear-cut certitude of a new faith, enforced the destructive but energizing
work of liberalism. But, unfolding with an inner logic of growth, out
of the older order emerged fresh forces and institutions. Protectionism,
with tariffs facing outward and dikes of combination crossing inwardly,
restrictionism in its various aspects, including its check on the free
flow of immigration, and nationalism in intensified forms-with intercluded
social cooperative organizations-were among the manifestations
of the new spirit. But meantime, with the growing complexity of
the social situation, new concepts of relativity, of evolutionary adaptation,
and of social solidarity were steadily undermining the former certainties
of an automatic, mechanical, predestined harmony. The altered
pattern of men's thinking, even though, or perhaps because, it
was accompanied by a sense of fluidity, has reinforced the dominant demand
for stability and social controls.
The need for wisely adapted and therefore more effective controls
underlies the craving for more statistical knowledge. If we are to have
better social controls, we must have records, many more of them, and
more men trained to interpret and to use them. The historians, especially
the economic historians, have a peculiar reason for their intense
interest in this momentous process of transition going on in our
own day. A study of operating social forces in a period of change will
yield not strict parallels, but insights and understandings of those earlier
operations which have left so impermanent a record. One of the many
interesting phenomena which mark such a period as ours, is the realignment
of public opinion. Who could have foretold in 1890 the change
in sentiment which made possible the consolidation provisions of the
Transportation act of 1920? Yet we can find repeated instances in


### ---Economics-1930-0-07.txt---
the past of such almost unconscious refigurement of the public mind,
as, for example, the change in opinion in England on the inclosure movement
between the sixteelnth and the eighteenth centuries. At times, the
great changes are initiated and carried on almost unperceived by those
who are themselves making them. Common use and wont is one of the
greatest enemies of the historical record; for ordinarily those gradual,
day-by-day changes in attitude of mind in which multitudes participate
are not observed and recorded. New concepts are diffused and slip
noiselessly into men's minds; they nestle down beside older alien concepts,
often without noticeable j ostling; new practices resulting therefrom
silently emerge or old ones quietly drop away, until at some point, the
preparation becoming far advanced, the new face of the world becomes
manifest with apparent suddenness, and the historian, casting about even
to set a date to this revolution, discovers another gap in the historical
record.

There is strong reason, therefore, at this particular juncture not
only to study attentively those hidden things which lie upon the surface
of the present, but to collect and preserve the commonplace documents
of the immediate past. Already the Business History Society is concerned
with the collection, preservation, and utilization of business documents,
not merely by its Boston headquarters, but by local historical
societies generally and especially by university and business school
libraries. Such documents as account books, letter files, reports and
other records of individual concerns, corporations, and trade associations,
above all the long-run series which for a time have been heaped in
storerooms and then destroyed, should now be preserved, sorted and
organized for study. Many of them may be had for the asking, some
under pledge of confidence for a certain number of years. What would
we not now give for a large accumulation of such material, say from Antwerp
of the sixteenth century, or from Lancashire of the eighteenth, to
add to such few documents as we possess! Yet we still permit similar
records, precious at least to our successors, to be destroyed by hundreds
of tons daily.

Towards meeting our own needs and answering our own questions
we can do something; and while we cannot imagine what questions our
successors will put to our time, nevertheless we must build for them as
well as for ourselves. It is tempting at times to meditate upon our
successors. Perhaps, two or three centuries hence, the highly trained
economists in what may at that date correspond to the Domestic Commerce
Division of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, at
Washington, may be preparing, from the great flow of current information
coming daily from all parts of the country, that perpetual inventory
of consumable resources, that delicately adjusted economic

indicator which will promptly measure and thus help to regulate the
fluctuations of business and government enterprise. They may, in their
historical section, be reporting on such imperfect but hopeful beginnings
as we are making in our statistical laboratories, our surveys of economic
and social changes, and our Presidential conferences. But we cannot
imagine what kind of ordered world these our successors will be living
in, or how far in the rhythm of hiistory the existing tendency to control
and stability may be carried. Will they still be discovering new merits
in the medieval ideals of the just price and of equality of social opportunity?
Or will a reaction have set in against an over-development of
the planned national economy and its neo-cameralistic economics?
However uncertain the future, of one thing we imay now be fairly sure;
as the tides of world history are now moving, each ebb and flow enlarges
progressively the knowledge obtainable from the human record. From
the imperfections of the social sciences will ultimately emerge more perfect
guides to social controls.

To the economist conflict is neither a new nor a strange phenomenon.
Very early in human history man learned that he could eat bread only
by the sweat of his face, and the lesson thus learned was rephrased by
the early economists into the doctrine that labor is the price of all economic
goods.

Man's first struggle was with the earth itself which grudgingly yielded
him a living; but this earthy contact gave him like Antaeus new strengtb
for the conflict. Man soon discovered, however, that his was not the only
species which depended for its existence upon the produce of the soil.
Only by an unceasing struggle with other forms of animal life could
human beings obtain a portion of the food and other resources which
nature dispensed impartially but with a sparing hand. So strenuous and
persistent has been this struggle for survival between man and otlher
organisms that a prominent entomologist has only recently declared that
it is still uncertain whether in the contest between the human and the
insect species it will be man who will survive.
Somewhere in the age-long struggle man discovered that conflict need
not always end in the destruction of the defeated party. His own


### ---Economics-1931-0-02.txt---
chances of survival were improved when he compromised with some of
his adversaries and even sought their co6peration in waging war on the
more unrelenting and destructive of their mutual enemies. Such compromises
and alliances were, of course, most likely to take place with human
beings themselves, and born of such toleration and alliances came
some of our earliest social groupings. Not all groups were formed witll
economic ends in view; but, whenever mutual aid could be secured by a
specialization of functions and a division of labor within the group, a
continuation of the tolerant attitude was most likely to result.
Conflict, it is to be noted, did not cease even within the group; but it
took on a more creative and less destructive form. Under the name
of competition it came to be thought of as a stimulating and constructive
force in human society; and among economists by the time of Adam
Smith competition was believed to be wholly beneficial. It was thought,
indeed, that it might even be relied upon as a sufficient regulator of man's
conduct in the world of commerce and industry.
If today we have ceased to accept the naYve argument that competition
is wholly a stimulating, never a destroying, force in our economic
life, it is not because we do not believe that competition can be made to
serve in the stimulating way in which Smith and his followers contended
that it would act. When it fails, it is because the competitors do not
possess equal strength and foresight and the stronger and more foresighted
are likely to insist that their individual interests are those of the
group. The weaker members are then obliged to combine in order to
restrain competition and prevent it from destroying both itself and them.
Such restraints are most frequently obtained by enlisting the support of
organizations based on non-economic motives, especially that of the
State whose functions are not only political but which usually represents
in its governing policy the ethical notions prevailing at the time. It is
not, therefore, through a cessation of conflict that unfair economic
competition is checked but by bringing into play another form of competition
that the equilibrium is restored.
While we may readily admit that economic competition needs at times
to be controlled in its own interest, that is, in order to preserve that
freedom which is its very foundation stone, it is equally true that economic
forces are at times called upon to preserve society from modes of
conflict which have their origin in other than economic motives, where
the struggle is more harmful and unless checked will completely destroy
the weaker contestants. More than once has the economic boycott
been resorted to by nations which were weak in armed forces to check the
aggressive political ambitions of their more warlike neighbors. Such
boycotts may have proved ineffective in restraining for any long time
the purchase of the offending commodities; but they have usually produced


### ---Economics-1931-0-03.txt---
sufficient fear among the producers to lead to a clamorous demand
that their own government reverse its policy.
The history of mankind has shown that ethnological, political and
even ecclesiastical societies are likely, when unchecked, to be more tyrannical
in their treatment of their defeated adversaries than are groups
formed to carry on the economic struggle. It is seldom that individuals
or associations pursuing economic ends push an advantage which they
have gained over their competitors to the point of complete destruction.
High prices may for a time yield high profits, but they will ultimately
destroy purchasing power or call forth substitutes. Low wages may be
reluctantly accepted but they do not secure the full productive capacities
of the workers. Competition among producers does not often take that
cut-throat form which results in the extinction of some of them but is
more likely to end in an agreement between, if not a complete merger of,
the competitors. The prudent creditor is one who hesitates to force
his debtor into bankruptcy.
It is perhaps some dim recognition of the fact that the economic conflict
is seldom destructive in its consequences that has led nations, when
political or racial antagonisms have produced an impasse, to call in the
international banker or the business man of large affairs to poin-L a way
out of the difficulties. Such men have learned, sometimes by experience,
more often by observation, that in competition it is well not to push an
advantage too far. They have also perceived that international strife,
while it may bring large and quick returns to the war profiteer, seldom
brings lasting advantages to the well-established business, especially if
that business is in part dependent on the international market as an
outlet for its goods.
War, while primarily a military and political conflict, cannot be kept
out of the economic arena. Trading with the enemy becomes a disloyal
act; the property and the patent rights of enemy aliens are sequestered;
blockades interfere with the trade of even neutral nations; moratoria
are declared which relieve the debtors from the importunities of their
creditors, and trade is diverted from its usual channels. Worst of all,
the war is likely to leave in its wake impoverished peoples who for years
and even decades will be weak and uncertain purchasers of domestic as
well as foreign goods. If Adam Smith was right in his belief that merchants
and manufacturers have a better knowledge of their own interests
than have other classes, we may safely conclude that big business interests,
other than the manufacturers of imunitions, will be more likely to
throw their influence in behalf of international peace than will those
persons who have less at stake and who, for that reason, are more likely
to give their passions and prejudices free rein. The pecuniary instinct
is not one of the noblest of human attributes but it is more subject to


### ---Economics-1931-0-04.txt---
compromise than are some of the other incentives to human conduct.
Accordingly, men who are governed by the desire for gain are more likelv
to find it to their interest to seek some other way out of an economic
contest than that which leads to armed conflict. If we may be permitted
to parody one of Smith's famous passages we may say: it is not from
the benevolence of the business and financial magnates that we expect
peace to be maintained but from their regard to their own interest.
In these post-war days when the recollection of the destructiveness of
the last war is still fresh in our minds and governments are being urged
to leave no stone unturned to prevent a renewal of conflict; when nations
are pledging themselves to renounce war as an instrument of international
policy; when conferences for naval reduction and for the settlement
of reparation difficulties are causing alternating hopes and disappointments
in the minds of those who have the will to peace, it is possible
that those mieetings less heralded whose determinations are often
concealed from the public, which the representatives of private business
corporations frequently hold to settle such problems as the control over
fuels, power and raw materials and the division of the world's markets
for certain commodities, are doing more to lay the foundations of international
peace than are the more spectacular efforts of our statesmen.
In spite of much which has been written in support of the widely-held
opinion that economic causes are those most often responsible for war,
this view of the matter seems to have been greatly exaggerated and is
contrary to that held by the sociologists who have given most attention
to the subject of conflict. The struggle to comnmand industrial resources
or markets may indeed produce friction among nations and powerfully
support other motives for war, but economic differences taken by themselves
are more likely to be settled by peaceable means than are international
disputes arising from other motives.
It is not the contention of this paper that international economic
competition is self-regulating; that it can be relied upon to prevent
war through the national self-interests involved, any niore than the selfinterests
of individuals can be expected to check exploitation of the weak
by the strong. Some government action will probably always be necessary
to check monopolistic price-making by international combinations
as it has been required to limit the efforts to create domestic monopolies.
But the claim is here made that international competition within the
economic sphere is less dangerous and less likely to be destructive than
are racial and cultural conflicts. Furthermore, it is claimed that the
economic struggle among nations is itself a force which makes for international
peace.

It is true that at times certain governments have given their support
to the forces of monopoly at work in their own dominions, when such


### ---Economics-1931-0-05.txt---
monopolies are in control of resources which are the exclusive possession
of the country in question, and have sought to limit the production or
export of the monopolized commodities. In such cases the government
is either sharing in the ownership and control of the monopoly, or is
endeavoring to obtain revenues by taxation of its profits. Such seems
to have been the situation in the Chilean nitrate and iodine export trade,
in the German potash industry and in the case of the Japanese camphor
monopoly. Similar controls by government, exercised perhaps for more
pardonable reasons but with less satisfactory results, have taken place
in the marketing of Brazilian coffee and crude rubber from British
colonial plantations. But the likelihood of a failure in the case of a
government monopoly which is dependent upon the international market
is much greater than in the case of that of a private corporation. Both
private and government monopolies run the risk of stimulating the search
for substitutes for the monopolized commodity; but a government
monopoly which undertakes to favor domestic producers over foreign
purchasers is bound to create resentment on the part of other governments.
In such case the threat of retaliation is often sufficient to prevent
unfair discriminations or unreasonably high prices.
Students of international affairs are for the most part agreed that
the present-day struggle between nations to secure or retain control
over such commodities as petroleum, rubber, copper and certain other
minerals is more likely to lead to international conflict than are national
efforts to secure markets for manufactured goods. If the chances of
war are to be reduced to a minimium, it is evident that some plan must
be devised whereby the world's supplies of these present-day necessities
can be made available to those producers who can make the best use of
them.

Of the nations which have been most insistent in their efforts to have
established a free world market for the purchase of the raw materials
for manufacture, one is Italy, which has very few of such resources.
Another is the United States, which possesses an abundance of many of
the most important minerals and basic materials for manufactures but
which is, nevertheless, dependent on outside sources for such things as
rubber, long-staple cotton, manganese, nickel, chromium, tin ore, raw
silk, pulp wood, sisal and potash, all of which are either not produced
at all in this country or in quantities insufficient to meet the needs of our
manufactures. The plea for an open market for raw materials may
seem, therefore, to be peculiarly an American one. Certain foreign nations
which have been restricting the export of raw materials found
within their dominions have not hesitated to call attention to the apparent
inconsistency of the American demand for a free market in which
to purchase supplies with our insistence that our own market must be


### ---Economics-1931-0-06.txt---
kept for our own manufacturers. American manufacturers have also
been inclined to think that their facilities for mass production and perhaps
unusual talents for conducting large-scale industrial operations
will give them an advantage in markets outside this country if they
can only secure their raw materials without obstacles being placed in
their way. However, it is well to remember that the recent activities
of the Dutch Shell Oil interests and of the Swedish Match Trust do not
lend credence to the notion that the United States has a monopoly of
business leadership.
International action of some sort would seem to be called for to bring
about a fair distribution of fuels, foodstuffs, power and raw materials;
and it is to the growth of power in the League of Nations or in some
other centralized authority in international affairs that we must hopefully
look for the future exercise of such authoritative control of distribution.
At present the League lacks the delegated authority and also
the means to make its findings effective and its decisions binding on its
own members, to say nothing of those nations outside the League whose
support is certainly necessary for any effective international control of
natural resources. As long as this situation continues, it seems obvious
that little more can be done by the League than to collect and make
public, statistical and other information as to the location and approximate
extent of these natural resources, how they are being utilized by
the nations which hold possession, and what obstacles, if any, exist, to
their full development and fair distribution. Something more can be
accomplished through the formulation by world economic conferences of
the principles which, in the minds of the delegates, should govern the
actions of the various nations when they are faced with this problem
of the control and distribution of raw materials. Such principles having
been formulated and adopted, the League can then urge their ratification
by its members in the hope that other than League members will
see the justice and wisdom of following the same policy.
Important as is this work of creating standards of conduct among
the nations, the process of education, by which the adoption of a universal
code of ethics is assured in matters in which national self-interests
seem so diverse from the ideals which a consideration of international
welfare would establish, is bound to be a slow one. If this is all that we
can depend upon to prevent wars arising from economic causes, we may
well despair of the attainment of international peace until the arrival
of the millenium. We have not had to wait, however, for the growth of
a world-power, which shall give force to international agreements covering
the exploitation of the natural resources when industrial progress
makes necessary their development. Capitalistic enterprises have made
their own bargains with the governments within whose dominions lie these


### ---Economics-1931-0-07.txt---
undeveloped resources. National prides and national animosities have
hindered but not prevented this exploitation. The need of undeveloped
or impoverished nations for revenues and the lack of sufficient capital
for the development of their own resources have induced industrially
backward nations to make bargains with and grant concessions to private
corporations for the purchase or lease of forest, mineral and other
lands within the boundaries of which the desired resources are supposed
to lie. Railways have been built, mining shafts sunk, oil wells driven and
plantations developed when necessary for the development of the resources
acquired, and even the native population has shared to some extent
in the prosperity brought by outside capital.
Economic conflict arises when other capitalistic enterprises, perhaps
under the control of othier nations, begin to develop similar resources
within the same country or perhaps in another part of the world and the
competing interests begin to place their products on the world market.
Then price wars follow which may be severe while they last, especially if
resources have been over-developed and not all the products can be
sold at profitable prices. In the old days of the chartered trading companies,
the conflict would have taken on a military aspect, for the charters
of the different companies would have authorized them to raise
armies, build fleets and to wage war, as did the British, Dutch and French
East India companies when they struggled to gain control of the accumulated
wealth of the Indies. But in the present era the industrial
and trading corporations do not possess the authority or the resources
to wage war. They are now accustomed to look to the governments of
their own countries to protect their interests. However, it is just this
combination of private and political agencies for the purpose of acquiring
or retaining control of natural resources and markets in regions
where foreign capital is engaged in the exploitation of such resources
which presents the greatest possibilities of war. The diplomatic efforts
of our own government to prevent other than American capitalists from
participation in the work of developing the natural resources of countries
in the Caribbean area have been especially disturbing in their effects on
the creation of a feeling of international good will and have made our
professions of a desire to see the open-door policy maintained elsewhere
seem insincere. It is a fair question whether a hands-off policy on the
part of governments which are sincere in their claims that they are not
pursuing imperialistic policies, and a limitation of their interference
to a dignified but strongly-worded protest against unwarranted attacks
mnade on their nationals who have invested their capital abroad would
not in the end create a better international feeling and afford more
protection to capital than do naval demonstrations or the threats of
military interference.


### ---Economics-1931-0-08.txt---
War is a costly and uncertain means of retaining control of economic
resources in distant lands. A more effective means is that of international
capitalistic combination. There are few countries which actually
exclude foreign capital from participation in domestic enterprises although
some countries forbid alien ownership of land or impose special
restriction upon the exploitation of their natural resources. The laws
which seek to control international monopolies seldom make any distinction
between national and international combinations of capital.
Hence it has become increasingly popular, especially since the World
War, for international combinations to be formed to secure concessions
for the development of industrial resources when large capital investments
are required. If, as usually happens, the capital investments in
such combinations come from several or many countries, such nations
have thereby given hostages for the preservation of peace.
There is neither time nor need in this paper to give a description of
these international combinations or even to recite their names. Most of
us know in at least a general way of the European iron and steel cartels,
of the combinations which have been formed in the potash, fixed nitrogen,
dye and artificial silk industries, of the Swedish-American match trust,
of the agreements or attempted agreements in the oil, sugar, rubber and
copper industries. Some of these agreements or combinations have been
formed to prevent over-production or to stabilize prices, it is true; but
the point here emphasized is that every one of these comnbinations, agreements
or pooling arrangements marks a shifting of conflict from the
political to the economic sphere and, to the extent to which this takes
place, lessens the likelihood of war between the nations.
Generally speaking, it may be said that capital knows neither national
nor race distinctions. Given equal security, it works as willingly for
Jew as for Gentile, for Catholic as for Protestant, for the yellow race
as for the Caucasian. Political governments having assumed certain
attitudes or made certain pronouncements find it very difficult to yield
the positions thus taken. The national pride is at stake and statesmen
and diplomats are hard put to it to find new formulas which seem to
adhere to the old attitudes while in reality they adopt new ones. But
economic statesmen have no such embarrassments. Economic life is by
its very nature subject to change. New forces make their appearance
which call for new methods of solving commercial and industrial problems.
Policies which for a time have succeeded but which have lost vigor
are sacrificed as quickly and as ruthlessly as are old machines or old
stocks of goods. For this reason it will usually be found to be the part
of wisdom for governments to interfere as little as possible with the
international flow of capital and with the financial and industrial arrangements


### ---Economics-1931-0-09.txt---
which are made for its investment and management except
to protect their citizens against monopolistic price policies.
Industrial leaders are at times unable to solve the problems which
arise from excessive competition, as we know from recent failures to
agree on a policy of restricted production by the oil, steel, sugar, and
rubber interests; but in these cases competition is always at work to bring
about an agreement later when the failure to agree means continued overproduction
and unprofitable prices.
It must not be forgotten that the policy of laissez-faire was first
announced and subsequently developed in the field of international trade
and while the intervening years have witnessed many departures
from it by the nations of the world, economists in general have continued
to give it their support within this sphere of action. Attacks upon the
principle have for the most part been made when its extreme advocates
have sought to justify it as a regulating force in the struggle between
labor and capital or that between producer and consumer. In the field
of international economics the striiggle is not likely to be less intense,
but it will be short-lived; and it may well serve as a satisfactory substitute
for international conflicts of a more sanguinar'y nature.

In 1763 the British government issued the Royal Proclamation which
forbade English colonists to settle west of the Allegheny mountains
except by special permission, a prohibition which stirred the ill will of
men of Massachusetts and Virginia alike and contributed to the creation
of the growing discontent which finally culminated in the Revolution.
But even before that event the paper frontier thus set up had been
crossed by roving individuals and by bands of adventurous men who
settled in the forbidden territory. And after the treaty of peace between
Great Britain and the new republic, no obstacle prevented the westward
movement except physical barriers and the resistance of the Indians.
Neither of these was able to stem the resistless surge of restless settlers
as they pressed on into the valley of the Ohio and the land to the south.
The fortunate purchase of the Louisiana territory opened up new vistas
and led to the later wresting of coveted California from a weaker neighbor.
Now the only limit to the westward movement was the Pacific Ocean,
and within seventy-five years from the Revolution, this had been reached.
It is perhaps incorrect to speak of this process of filling up the land
with settlers as pushing back the frontier, for in the changing kaleidoscopic
picture there were many frontiers. There was the trappers' and
fur traders' frontier, far beyond the fixed habitations of men, a fluctuating
and retreating line which followed the disappearing fur-bearing
animals tinto the northwest and southwest, and then leaped the intervening
distances to the far west. The ranchers' frontier existed first
along the western fringe of the early colonies, but was pressed ever farther


### ---Economics-1932-0-02.txt---
west by the home-making husbandmen who fenced in the range and
plowed up the pasture land. The picturesqueness of this phase of frontier
life has given to the cowboy an importance in story and literature
which he never possessed in real life. Today there remain only a few
faded remnants in out-of-the-way places of the fast-riding ranchers.
The miners' frontier on the whole moved westward, but it knew no
law and jumped from one new mining district to another, zigzagging
in drunken fashion from Pennsylvania coal and iron to Missouri lead
and to Michigan copper, taking a flying leap to California when gold
was discovered there, but jumping back to Pennsylvania to exploit the
petroleum deposits. Then the precious metals called again to Colorado
and Nevada, and the much more useful iron beckoned to Minnesota.
Such a frontier cannot be neatly mapped and charted, but it had such
distinctive features that the mining camps have given flavor and picturesqueness
to our literature and geographical nomenclature.
The true westward movement was carried on by the farmers. It was
they who filled up the open spaces, took over the land, built homes and
other improvements, and steadily pushed back the border of settlement.
The rapidity and scope of this movement were unprecedented in history.
In the single decade 1870-1880 there were added to the cultivated area
of the United States over 190,000,000 acres, or a territory equal in extent
to Great Britain and France combined, while in the following twenty-
year period 1880-1900 the farm area was increased by 305,000,000
acres. This was equal in extent to the rest of Europe, excepting Spain.
In 1890 the Superintendent of the Census announced that the frontier
had disappeared. Defining the frontier as an area where the population
was less than two per square mile, he presented figures in the census of
that year to show that the population was everywhere more dense than
that minimum, and therefore concluded that the land was now solidly
settled from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and that the last frontier
had been eliminated from our history. This was a statement of profound
significance, for it presaged the end of free land, the lure of
which had dotted the western plains with homesteaded farms; and it indicated
that the great task of the American people-that of subduing a
continent to the uses of man-was now completed.
But was the Superintendent of the Census correct in claiming that
the frontier had disappeared?
Whatever may have been true of the physical advance of the population
and the appropriation and exploitation of the public domain, it is
clear to us today as we look back to the decade of the 1890's that in
many respects and in many branches of human achievement the frontier
had only been visioned, but not conquered. This was the decade of bitter
debate and serious struggle over the establishment of the gold standard,


### ---Economics-1932-0-03.txt---
when the pioneers of sound money and good banking began through two
decades to push their toilsome way to the frontiers of the federal reserve
system. New frontiers of large-scale manufacturing, of mechanized
industry, of more efficient mass production for the ever enlarging markets
were glimpsed at this time; and far-sighted leaders began the reorganization
of industry which led them far beyond the former bounds.
A new horizon of foreign trade was opened up and the expansion of
our commerce was limited only by the failure of world demand. Somewhat
more tardily, the next decade saw new frontiers pushed out in intensive
farming, in conservation, and in other phases of the more scientific
development of our resources.
But still other frontiers remained, less tangible and material, which
in the early nineties were only faintly seen afar off. The Philadelphia
Exposition of 1876 revealed to the American people for the first time
on any large scale new values of art in its various forms, higher standards
of architecture, and a better appreciation of beauty. And, although
the world smiled at midwestern pretensions to culture, Chicago pushed
forward the frontiers of artistic, musical, and literary appreciation and
production both geographically and spiritually by her World's Fair in
1893. Since then the borders of this province have been extended rapidly
and steadily westward until the frontier has disappeared. It is difficult
to estimate achievement in this sphere, for no unit of measurement
exists; but, if we adopt the yardstick of the Superintendent of the
Census, we may fairly assert that today probably no place can be found
in the United States whose artistic, literary, or musical population is
less than two to the square mile.
This process of pushing out the frontiers of material achievement
inevitably affected the estimation in which some cultural values were
held. Economic success was rated higher than classical learning, and
the skill of the artisan counted for mnore than that of the artist. But
who shall say what scale of values should obtain on the frontier with
more authority than the frontiersman himself? Gradually, however, the
physical frontier was overcome; and, with material success assured,
the pioneer hungered for some of the less tangible goods he had left
behind. The transformation of the raw prairie into seemly homes and
beautiful cities was not accomplished in a decade or even in a generation.
Many a sprawling untidy western city today attests the difficulty of
such change. And yet in time roads and railways, mail route and telegraphs
and telephones, court-houses and parks, motion picture palaces
and chain stores, and all the other accompaniments of American civilization
have been set up along Main Street.
Some there always were among the early pioneers who appreciated
the value of higher education and who were not content merely to transform


### ---Economics-1932-0-04.txt---
Main Street into Broadway. These men were ready to make sacrifices
to establish schools and churches and to set up the symbols of a
higher culture. The democratic co-educational state university, a typically
western institution, was devised by the pioneers as an answer to
the demand for opportunities for general higher education. Thus the
frontier of learning closely followed, and was all but coterminous with,
the physical frontiers of settlement and material success. Its conquest
was marked by the establishment of schools and colleges, of libraries,
art museums, and conservatories of music, beautiful homes and wellplanned
cities, all of which may be accepted as manifestations of civilization.


Human advance is never even along all lines; it moves more rapidly
in certain directions and more slowly in others. In some aspects progress
consists in conquering nature, in appropriating her fruits, and in harnessing
natural forces to our needs; but in other aspects it means adaptation
to the environment. The westward movement partook of both. The
need of the times was on the whole for men of action, and for the tasks
to be performed strong men were bred. At other times in the world's
history, other needs and ideals have been paramount, and society has
responded in kind. In the twelfth century man wished to be a crusader;
in the sixteenth a buccaneer; in the eighteenth an empire builder; in the
nineteenth an industrial leader; and in the twentieth a scientist.
Although we have in 300 years pushed back somewhat the frontiers
of agriculture and industry, of culture and learning, we have only comparatively
recently essayed the task of scientific adventuring. And in
spite of splendid achievements in the fields of the physical and biological
sciences, we have probably-if the picture of our westward movement
may be applied-scarcely done more than cross the Appalachian Mountains.
If we consult the leaders in these sciences, we learn indeed of
significant discoveries and great progress, but also of major problems
still awaiting solution. Let me submit a few random samples from some
of the important sciences.
It is a trite observation to remark that our present industrial advance
has been due primarily to technological improvements, and that
society today depends as never before upon the application of science
to industry. Anyone who has attempted to follow the recent epoch-making
contributions, especially of the physical sciences, cannot but be
deeply impressed by the enormous range and advance of scientific invention
and discovery within the last five decades. When Bell and Edison,
the Wright brothers, Pupin and Millikan first looked out upon
the field of scientific endeavor it must have seemed to them that they
stood on the verge of the frontier. But owing to the work of these and
other men that border has been steadily extended. The heavens have


### ---Economics-1932-0-05.txt---
been immeasurably widened; remote stars have been descried, measured,
weighed, and analyzed. The earth has shrunk in size and importance
as it has been assigned a relatively inconspicuous place in a greater
cosmos. New elements have been discovered, and the forces of nature
have been captured and harnessed to man's uses. But we remain still
on the threshold of the universe.
A generation or two ago the physicist was one of the most cocksure
of our scientific colleagues; today he is the most humble. New vistas
of knowledge have been opened up to him, on the frontier of which
he now stands. He has learned to utilize the force of electricity, but remains
perplexed before the movements of the electrons in their courses
within the atom. In the field of metallurgy he has discovered, if not new
metals, at least new combinations that have given the lightness with
strength which make possible the ever-longer flights of airplanes, the
hardness that is necessary for an automobile crankshaft, and the brightness
which is found in the trimmings of even the cheapest era. And yet
in this very domain, which he had apparently exploited so thoroughly,
the metallurgist and engineer finds himself on the frontier of new scientific
knowledge. "What is cohesion?" asked Sir Oliver Lodge. "Why,
when I pick up one end of my walking stick, does the other end come
up too?" The honest physicist answers that he does not know. He may
talk about attraction among atoms, but that is merely giving a name
to the unknown. The essential nature of cohesion is still a matter of
speculation.

Our material civilization today is based primarily upon the utilization
of power, most of which is derived from the stores of coal and oil which
are rapidly being depleted if not exhausted. But at almost every stage
the processes of production and utilization are still woefully wasteful.
In the present state of the exploitation of petroleum about three-fourths
of the oil remains in the soil. The recovery of the balance is a standing
challenge to science. In the case of coal the amount recovered varies according
to conditions; in the bituminous mines of Illinois only about
half of the coal is brought to the surface. Even more wasteful is the
utilization of oil and coal for power or heating. In spite of the continuous
improvement of the steam engine, or its replacement by the turbine or
gas motor, the ominous fact still confronts us that the greater part of
the energy derived from the combustion of the coal and oil is wasted.
The science of getting the maximum out of a pound of coal is still in its
infancy. It is true that great improvements have been made since the
World War, but the tardiness of this advance should make us apologetic
rather than proud. Man has become acquainted with enormous natural
forces, but he has not as yet contrived control of them nor reached an
adequate notion of their wise use.


### ---Economics-1932-0-06.txt---
Although man has practised agriculture and lived on the fruits of
the earth for hundreds of thousands of years, we do not yet understand
in detail the process of the growth of chloroplast, that part of the plant
which transforms the energy of sunlight into the potential energy of
carbon compounds. And yet if chloroplast, the green pigment in plants,
should cease to function, all plant and animal life would soon end upon
the earth. The so-called virus diseases or mosaics of plants constitute
a baffling mystery which plant pathologists have for a generation tried
in vain to penetrate.
In 1898 Sir William Crookes predicted that, at the then rate of increase
of world population, before 1931 the nations would be faced with
a scarcity of wheat. And yet today we have a surplus. How can the
error of this eminent scientist be explained? He based his prediction
on the scarcity of nitrogen for fertilizer; but this need has been so successfully
met by the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen that there is now
danger of an overproduction of fixed nitrogen as well as of wheat. And
yet, in spite of this brilliant achievement, the age-old process by which
plant bacteria "fix" nitrogen in the soil is not known.
Almost coincidentally with the beginning of the westward movement
in America, economics began its career as a science. But its pioneering
days were soon over. As the great industrial and social changes introduced
by the Industrial Revolution became consolidated and crystallized,
so the theory which interpreted them became systematized and
fixed. Basing themselves upon insufficient economic history and unproven
psychological assumptions the classical economists made a premature
attempt to formulate generalizations and "laws," and claimed for their
science a finality which left no-or few-frontiers. And a science without
frontiers cannot advance far. But even from the beginning there
were bold spirits who pioneered in the domain of economic theory, the
while their compatriots pushed the physical frontier across the middle
west of the United States and essayed new experiments in practical activities
and in public policy.
The last advance has come within a decade and is led by those who,
under the influence of scientific method, insist that the science of economics
must be freed from ideas that cannot be tested and proved. They
saw moreover that technology was remaking the material wbrld, and
were dissatisfied with the aloofness and abstractions of prevailing economic
theory. This they urged should deal not merely with wealth, but
with human behavior; and, since the behavior of human beings varies in
response to the differing stimuli of changing environments, they declared
that the enormous changes in our economic and social environment must
be taken into account. The World War called many economists into
services in which they attempted to translate their theories into public


### ---Economics-1932-0-07.txt---
policies. New economic experiments and inventions were made, some of
which constituted real pioneering in the field of human welfare. The new
schools of economists began to insist that their science be not treated
in vacuo, but that it meet the present needs of the factory, the market
place, and the home. The brilliant work of the physicists, the chemists,
and the biologists in conquering the forces of nature compelled the
economists and their allies to face the still more vital problems of social
engineering.

Here is a new frontier. Like every other frontier it was at once a
barrier and a challenge. The general and ready acceptance by the world
of the benefits of science, and the increasing reliance by men of affairs
upon the technologists, inclined them to accept the guidance of those
among the economists or their followers who proclaimed themselves
leaders. Armed with statistical charts and price curves these announced
a new era of prosperity, but the event proved that the advance had not
been along scientific lines. Economic science may be richer by the experience
of the past three years, but the lesson was dearly bought.
In comparison with the definite and positive achievements of the
physical and biological sciences the contributions of the social sciences
to human wealth and welfare are frequently belittled. But such a judgment
errs in taking too short a view. It was surely a daring step in
social experimentation for a generation trained in mercantilist theory
to rely upon free enterprise and competition as guides in the economic
sphere. And the industrial system created during the nineteenth century
has on the whole served the people well, though sometimes the engineer
veers in his course or seems to lose control of the engine. Credit in full
measure may be claimed for much of the economic progress already
achieved, such as the great increase in productivity, the improved standard
of living of the mass of the people, shorter hours, the lessened strain
of manual labor, and the increasing emphasis upon the worth of man
and of his welfare in the economic scheme.
In the complex society of today, moreover, no single science or group
of sciences can claim a mionopoly of method or of human knowledge.
Technology and economics, biology and sociology, engineering and statistics
are interrelated and interdependent. Technological improvements
call for social adjustments, but the technical and engineering enterprises
in turn wait for economic wealth. Advance in one conditions progress in
the others. Economists may fairly claim that their contributions have
been significant and essential. Economic theory has, on the whole, run
ahead of business administration; there has been a lag between the discovery
of truth and its application by those in control of industry. But
neither physical nor social scientists can rest content with the progress
already made, which, in comparison with the unplumbed possibilities of


### ---Economics-1932-0-08.txt---
the future, seems small. If the advance made is to be held and the promised
peaks of prosperity are to be permanently possessed, further pioneering
is called for.

What then are the unsolved economic problems which constitute the
frontier of our science? It has been said that no two economists agree
on anything, and perhaps no one here will accept this list as complete
or satisfactory. But in this time of industrial depression there will be no
dissent if the fluctuations of the business cycle and recurring unemployment
be named as the most important and urgent problem. Nor would
there probably be serious dispute if the conviction were expressed that
a rational system of economics would endeavor to control such obvious
economic irrationalities as the spending of money on reclamation in
spite of agricultural overproduction, the continued waste of economic
resources, unbalanced and misdirected production, wasteful marketing,
foolish spending under pressure, inequitable distribution of the national
income, the toleration of preventable disease and needless accidents, the
breeding of the unfit and the degenerate, the selection of ignorant or
corrupt officials for public service, the cultivation of national and international
antipathies, and the inexcusable folly of competitive armaments
and war.

The list of unsettled questions might be lengthy, but it is not upon
this note that I wish to conclude. An efficient material civilization has
been developed by which man has lifted himself higher above the level
of savages than has ever been done before. The physical plant which our
engineers have built up is probably adequate to our present needs. After
the conquest of the material world new domains of ethical, intellectual,
and artistic achievement lie open before us, which can only be attained
by the great mass of the people, as becomes a democracy, when they have
been freed from drudgery and dulling manual toil. Aristotle once said
that if the shuttle would weave by itself and the plectrum play on the
lyre without hands, then the chief workmen would not need helpers nor
civilization slaves. The conditions laid down by Aristotle have in effect
been realized and as a result not only is modern industry carried on by
free men, but abundant leisure is assured for the development of finer
manifestations of religion, beauty, appreciation, and culture.
The work of pioneering has carried us from the Atlantic to the Pacific
coast, from a hard struggle with nature to a high level of material comfort,
but the task is not yet completed. Denied further lateral expansion,
the pioneering spirit is moving vertically and is raising our material and
cultural standards to higher levels. The frontier is thus pushed upward
rather than outward. On each loftier plane new boundaries offer fresh
challenge; the frontier recedes as we progress and stimulates to renewed
efforts. The boundaries of our science are not fixed; they reach up to


### ---Economics-1932-0-09.txt---
the heavens. Today the most critical dilemma of modern industrialism is
how to acquire a greater degree of control over our economic system.
We must also effect a synthesis of usefulness and beauty, of learning and
life, of material achievement and art, of economics and ethics. Life is
after all one organic whole, and technology and culture are not and
should not be distinct. Mere material achievement is not a final goal. We
must provide a juster social organization, a civilization more appreciative
of and better able to use leisure, art, literature, the finer things of
the spirit, and higher ethical ideals.

Classical and neo-classical economic theory is commonly associated
with a form of liberalism that was more largely directed toward the
repeal of old laws and regulations than to the constructive development
of institutions to meet new social problems. In the past the chief emphasis
has been laid upon these destructive accomplishments of economic
liberalism. It has therefore been easy to overlook the actual constructive
accomplishments of the early nineteenth century, and many are disposed
to believe that these positive achievements were inconsistent with
the primary postulates of classical and neo-classical theory. It must
be confessed that there is confusion of thought in the writings of the
early nineteenth century economists; but a positive theory of constructive
statecraft is implicit in the basic liberal concepts. The most characteristic
features of classical theory lead directly toward a broad concept
of the task of the state.
Classical theory was based upon the concept of an orderly and rational
system of nature, and the concept of a contractual society. We
need not concern ourselves here with the precise forms in which these
concepts were held by the economists of the nineteenth century, because
it is more important to direct our attention to the full content of these
ideas than to the imperfect and incomplete formulations that have prevented
liberal views from achieving their full development.
The science and philosophy of the nineteenth century has greatly
enlarged the scope of both of these fundamental concepts. The philosophy
of nature has been profoundly changed by the development of the
chemical and biological sciences and by the new achievements of astronomy.
Bare mechanical categories of cause and effect have been supplemented
by concepts of adaptation, and of reciprocal determination.
Concepts of absolute laws of nature have been softened so that we now
recognize that the scope of any particular generalization is conditioned
by its place in some system of relations. We recognize, too, that no single
system of relations exhausts all possible interests or interpretations.
In like fashion our attitude toward social and economic institutions
has been profoundly transformed since the publication of the Wealth


### ---Economics-1933-0-02.txt---
of Nations. The development of the concept of evolution has exerted its
most direct influence upon economics by placing institutions in a new
light. The older writers commonly refer to the "existing" institutions,
or to the "existing" system of private property. The explicit descriptions
of the institutional system were thus static, and rarely is there
any positive recognition of historical process in the sense of continuous
change. Even the most devoted adherents of pure theory, today, recognize
the fact of historical development and the essentially dynamic
quality of the basic phenomena of economic life. We are all familiar
with secular trends, cyclical movements, and incidental fluctuations and
variations. These phenomena can now be distinguished explicitly even
though full analysis is still incomplete.
But although the basic postulates of theory have been restated in
much more sophisticated forms, they have not lost their identity. In
fact, we might even say that we are only beginning to appreciate the
full significance of the concepts of the early classical writers. The concept
of social evolution is deeply imbedded in their thought, despite
certain infelicities of expression and despite their failure to follow out
the implications of what was at the time a novel and unfamiliar idea.
The utilitarian concepts of Bentham and John Stuart Mill express, in
addition to many other things, a specific concept of social adaptation.
Both Bentham and Mill achieved notable concepts of an historical process.
They recognized that specific institutions may possess constructive
social significance-utility-at a particular period which they may at
a later time cease to possess because of social change. The utility of particular
institutions thus becomes a criterion for the legislator in considering
social policy; institutions which have lost their utility should
be discontinued, those which promise to be useful may be established
or developed. Mill's discussion of rights of property contains important
historical implications, though historical facts are not stressed at any
point. The entire discussion rests upon an explicit concept of historical
development in which the state may play an active and constructive
part.

In other respects, too, the notion of historical process appears in the
classical writing. The references to institutions are, indeed, couched in
essentially static terms, but references are made to different moments in
the process of social evolution. The process is always thought of as a
whole, and this sense of unity was so strongly felt that the writers were
not conscious of the dangers and ambiguities involved in neglecting to
distinguish between the moments of reference. In discussing such an
historical process there are three primary moments of reference that
are especially useful in abstract analysis. We may refer to the process
at its beginning, when we assume that all its content is implicit; we may


### ---Economics-1933-0-03.txt---
refer to our own present, when much development has taken place,
though many features of the entire system are incomplete and imperfect;
or, using our imagination, we may refer to the ultimate achievement of
the full content of the process, when we presume that all the imperfections
and inadequacies have been overcome and the system stands
forth in its full perfection.
The assumption that economic generalizations were valid througlhout
the historical period rested upon the concept of the unity of the process
of institutional development. The ultimate achievement was taken to be
no more than an expression of relationships which exist at all times and
places irrespective of the institutional devices required for their manifestation.
With such assumptions it was obviously a matter of indifference
whether abstract analysis concerned itself with the bare relations
implicit in social life or with their objective manifestation in a fully
developed institutional system. One might discuss either the economic
phenomena of primitive society or the operations of the perfected system
of private property and contract which would ultimately emerge
when the obsolete survivals of the feudal order had been entirely eliminated
by liberal reform.

This position had elements of logical significance. But there was little
positive defense for the common presumption that the process as a whole
could be thought of as the existing order. To assume that the given moment
could be identified with the ultimate end of the process, involved
the tacit assumption that the process was already approximately complete,
so that the developments of the future were really negligible. This
is a dangerous assumption, but it is by no means an uncommon tendency
of idealists. The imagination is not so severely taxed if it seems certain
that the consummation of all hopes is awaiting "just around the corner."
The nineteenth century liberals were thinking in terms of a final achievement
of the free society in the immediate future.
Underlying all these confused references to the history of institutions
there was thus a positive concept of evolution that was truly remarkable.
For most of these notions appeared before there was any systematic
theory of social evolution. Accordingly, we are justified in feeling
that the explicit development of the theory of social evolution is no more
than a working out of ideas which were significantly present in the classical
writing. There is positive continuity of thought.
The transition from the early form of liberal doctrine to the latter
form involves only two new elements. We must recognize that we cannot
refer indifferently to any particular moment in the process as if it
stood for the whole. Although we may properly discuss the phenomena
at any stage, and although our discussions will have some significance
for the analysis of the process in its entirety, each of the various moments


### ---Economics-1933-0-04.txt---
in the process must be distinguished. We should always be clear
in our minds as to the moment of reference; whether it be the beginning,
the end, or the specific present. The need for this accuracy in statement
scarcely requires elaboration. It is really no more than common
intellectual tidiness.
The second element of novelty involves a genuine development of doctrine.
It is important to recognize the insufficiency of a concept of social
evolution that involves nothing more than the explicit manifestation of
elements that are all present at the beginning. The notion that the totality
of relations is implicit at the outset has many logical attractions,
but the historical consequences are serious. If it be true that the
end of the process is implicit at the beginning nothing really new actually
happens. Time and history would, in this case, merely display a
sequence of events which follow each other by mechanical necessity. The
difficulties involved in such a view have been extensively explored by
Bergson and other modern philosophers; and the earlier concept of process
so brilliantly expressed by Hegel must be deemed unsatisfactory.
We must adopt some concept of historical process that recognizes the
accumulation of new elements around a basic nucleus. The precise detail
of the process is not important for the particular problem in hand,
once it is acknowledged that new things happen and that the movement
of history is not a mechanical display of unconscious cosmic force. We
must, however, find some means of assimilating definitely new elements
to the moving process. Otherwise life and history are no more than a
rigidly prescribed pilgrimage of grace. The concept of evolution implicit
in the classical economics was too thin to exhibit its most significant
properties. There was so much mechanical necessity in its movement
that it afforded too little scope for the positive activities of either state
or individual. There was adaptation, but of a passive kind that was
scarcely more than a mechanical response to the material or the social
environment. The adjustments even of individuals were commonly assumed
to involve no more conscious choice than a narrow mathematical
calculation of profits and losses. Once we recognize the reality of innovation
over wide fields of activity, the significance of constructive activities
of both state and individuals becomes strikinglv clear.
The acceptance of the evolutionary concept in any broad form requires
us to assume that the end of the process of development is remote.
The present moment cannot be identified with the end of the process. We
cannot assume that our institutions are approximately mature and adequate,
so that the imperfections of social organization can be deemed
negligible for purposes of theoretical analysis. It is essential that we
should be keenly conscious that the imperfections of adjustment are
important and that positive, conscious action is essential to overcome


### ---Economics-1933-0-05.txt---
them. Further, any given society will always find its institutional mechanisms
inadequate and imperfect, because changing conditions create new
needs and problems for which self-regulating mechanisms cannot instantly
be created. Regulation is thus essential even in a society that tends
to be self-regulating.
Closely associated with this fact of imperfection in social organization
is the problem of monopoly. Though generally recognized and extensively
discussed, monopoly was assumed to be a mere incidental intrusion
into a social system that was predominantly and naturally competitive.
The older theory assumed monopoly to be foreign to the natural
order of a contractual society, though both natural and legal monopolies
were recognized. This position was in part justified by the older
theoretical contention that monopoly price emerged only under conditions
of substantially complete control of supply. All intermediate conditions
between pure competition and pure monopoly were presumed to
reveal an essentially competitive price structure. Recent developments
in theoretical analysis have completely overthrown this view; and we
must consequently recognize that important monopolistic powers emerge
over an extensive range of cases of monopolistic competition. We are
thus forced to recognize that society is not inherently competitive. The
range of effective competition is much narrower than was long supposed,
and doubtless we may say with truth that competition has never been
effectively organized over the major part of trade and commerce. The
regulation of monopoly is thus a much more important field of activity
than the classical economists assumed it to be, and their own principles
now require an extension of the activity of the state far beyond any
limits that they would have supposed to be essential.
The modern liberal thus believes that social evolution is a constructive
process which involves active participation of both individuals and state.
There is no guiding hand other than the collective wisdom of each generation.
By reason of persistent imperfection and maladjustment, the
remedial activities of the state must needs be extensive; anld, as monopoly
is ever present over a wide field, vigorous regulation is essential to the
protection of the welfare of the public. Modern liberalism thus presents
an entirely new outlook on life, despite a certain continuity of thought
that really reaches back to the sixteenth century philosophy of the
Commonweal.

The full significance of these extensions of the range of state activity
will be more explicitly perceived if we turn to some contemporary problems.
Any development of national planning might seem to be wholly
inconsistent with the basic concepts of liberalism. Planned or regulated
production of certain basic mineral products can be urged by the liberal
on two important counts: conservation of primary resources in the


### ---Economics-1933-0-06.txt---
interest of society as a whole, and the regulation of the monopolistic
conditions almost certain to arise in the large-scale enterprises based on
these mineral deposits.
Many are disposed to question the possibility of assimilating national
planning even in basic industries to the so-called "competitive"
structure of modern society. These doubts ignore many of the realities
of the industrial development of the last forty years. National planning
has long existed in important fields both in this country and in Germany.
If we consider the actual conditions in the iron and steel industry
of the United States since 1890, and forget for the moment all the sophistications
created by the Sherman law and the Supreme Court, it is
fairly evident that the leaders of the industry have deliberately controlled
the rate of investment in the industry, the balance of facilities
for the production of the primary classes of products, and the approximate
rate of annual production. We cannot legally admit that this is
the case, but such is the simplest description of what has actually taken
place. On the whole, there can be little doubt of the essential wisdom
of these arrangements and no little credit is due the industrialists and
jurists by whose ingenuity these activities were brought within the law.
In Germany, of course, the activities of the cartels and large-scale industries
are still more evident, and the nationalization of various industries
since the war is a notable demonstration of planning. In these fields
national planning does not really involve any bureaucratic control of
the details of industrial organization, but merely recognizes the presence
of monopoly or monopolistic competition. The normal sphere of direct
governmental activity would thus be the regulation of the monopolized
industry in the interest of the public.
The general concepts of liberalism are certainly not inconsistent with
an extension of regulated monopoly to transportation and to the production
of oil, coal, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and electricity. Both
England and Germany are already far in advance of us in respect of
the development of interconnected production and distribution of electricity.
The policies of these countries are certainly more consistent with
liberal principle than the policy or absence of policy that has until the
present year characterized our activities in these fields.
Closely associated with these problems is the question of the nature
of the rights of private property. Wild-cat oil production has been
defended in this country for two generations because any interference
with the individual would constitute a confiscation of property. This
reasoning ignores entirely some of the simplest aspects of comparative
jurisprudence. There is no general principle of law by which surface
rights are inevitably extended to underlying minerals. In Spanish colonial
law all property in minerals vested in the crown. All persons were entitled
to search for minerals, and authorized to exploit minerals discovered


### ---Economics-1933-0-07.txt---
upon payment of certain dues to the government. In Cornwall,
and in the lead mining area of the Mendip hills, surface owners had
no exclusive rights to undiscovered minerals nor any right to prevent
the search for minerals. Rights to the precious metals in England vested
in the crown, and at a critical period in the sixteenth century coal
barely escaped inclusion within the category of mines royal. The precise
limits of rights of property are not very specifically defined. Limits
vary in different jurisdictions and at various times. The redefinition of
these limits constitutes one of the most interesting and significant aspects
in the evolu-tion of our modern contractual society. Recognition of the
fact of social development necessarily commits the liberal to continuous
redefinition of the rights of property. This important feature of public
policy was clearly perceived by John Stuart Mill when he said "the
institution of private property can be improved."
The uncertain future of the gold standard and the current discussion
of various forms of managed currencies raise issues which carry
us more specifically beyond classical theory. The automatic gold standard
was intimately bound into the early liberal concept of a self-regulated
society in which government control and interference were casual and
exceptional. The modern analysis of credit would seem to involve a
serious break with characteristic liberal concepts. It certainly involves
a complete abandonment of a concept of social adjustment produced
by individual acts and choices in which the specific personal interest
is the sole basis of the judgment or choice. Each individual by following
his own interests was presumed to promote the achievement of a
general social welfare that was never consciously considered by anyone,
whether individual or government official. This view was vividly
expressed in respect of banking policy. The function of the bank was
reduced to the task of supplying the credit demanded by the trader;
and, though it was recognized that only "legitimate" demands must
be granted, this qualification meant merely that only bona fide commercial
paper based on actual goods might safely be discounted. The
banker was thus merely the passive servant of the trader. Under these
circumstances, the government need merely insist upon the maintenance
of the convertibility of credit into gold, by preventing imprudent issue
of notes or imprudent neglect of reserves.
None of the outstanding modern analyses of credit accept such a passive
concept of banking policy. It is pretty generally recognized that
banking involves not only serving the trader but in a measure directing
the general course of his activities. Management of the currency is an
inescapable necessity. The present problem is to discover the true objectives
of currency management, and to discover appropriate means of
credit control.

The enlarged concepts of the system of nature bring new elements


### ---Economics-1933-0-08.txt---
to the description and analysis of the processes of economic and social
adjustment; but the changes affect details rather than essentials. The
early identification of liberalism with the doctrine of non-interference
was due to a misconception of the process of adaptation. The restatement
of liberal doctrine is thus a correction of an unfortunate error; a
necessary enlargement of the concepts of nature and social process.
We must recognize that both individual and social adjustment is the
result of conscious effort. Although we can reconcile the achievement
of individual ends with the welfare of society as a whole, it does not
follow that general welfare can be achieved without positive thought and
effort, as a mere residual consequence of the enlightened selfishness of
individuals. It is no longer possible to accept any concept of a mechanical
self-regulating society that excludes the state as an agency of change.
The state must needs be an active participant in social process.
The recognition of such extensive fields for the activity of the state
may seem to destroy all distinction between liberalism and various forms
of nationalism and radicalism. Important differences still remain, both
in principle and practice. The liberal concept of the function of the
state and of social process is realistic. Statecraft is treated as a process
of adjustment and adaptation. The only aim is the achievement at
each moment of the greatest measure of social welfare, national and
international.

Other concepts of statecraft are frankly idealistic. The nationalist
sees only the national state as an end of social and economic policy.
The socialist sees some form of socialist state. The radical pursues
various ideals according to his lights. None of these systems of statecraft
sufficiently recognize the limitations imposed upon our conscious
action by objective circumstance. All these systems of thought assumc
that society can be made to conform to some abstract ideal. The statesman
is presumed to be able to accomplish his will. Since the days of
Jean Bodin liberals have steadfastly opposed this concept of social
process. They have endeavored to demonstrate the ways in which the
development of social life and social organization are modified by external
circumstance. They have endeavored to analyze historical process and
economic phenomena, so that by the cunning of reason the laws of nature
nay be made a means to our social ends. But we conquer nature only
through the understanding of her ways. Social development is not a
demonstration of the superiority of the mind over matter: conscious
activity is itself an aspect of the system of nature.
The enlargement of the concepts of historical process and of the
system of nature do not modify in any essential respect the general
issues between the liberal and the idealists. The analysis of the localization
of industry based upon liberal principles affords no grounds for


### ---Economics-1933-0-09.txt---
presuming the antagonisms of economic interest that are assumed by the
nationalists. Nor is there any basis for the assumption that the primary
features of the territorial division of labor can be significantly modified
or controlled by protective tariffs. At the most, tariff measures can
soften the shocks produced by technological changes. These effects are
certainly not negligible, but they do not play the dominant part in economic
development presumed by the nationalists.
The hope of the socialist that poverty can and will be abolished seems
to the modern liberal merely an ungrounded act of faith; significant as
a motive for reforms, but incapable of realization. The objective limitations
to the satisfaction of our wants rest upon costs rather than
upon absolute scarcity. Former ages seldom experienced an absolute lack
of necessities: in the world as a whole there was bitter want in particular
localities, because the commodities needed were available only in a relatively
distant region. Technological improvement changes the incidence
of scarcity and of cost, but it affords no guarantee that all the requisite
commodities can be placed in the hands of all consumers under conditions
of cost compatible with the functioning of society. Scarcity has
always been relative: and in this sense it remains a permanent economic
problem. Cost must needs appear in any form of society, even though
the rules of allocation are changed. The fact that some of the costs of
the Soviet electric plant on the Dnieper were not borne by the industry
itself, does not mean that they do not exist as a factor in the budget
of the state and in the supply of consumer goods available to the people.
It is doubtless within the power of society to relieve the more extreme
forms of destitution, but there are positive limits to actual accomplishment.
The Webbs and others have shown that destitution is essentially
a phase of maladjustment. This is in part due to social deficiencies,
but in part due to the failure of the individual to meet the requirements
of his environment. Remedial measures can be applied to most of these
problems, but, even if there were no resistance to the application of the
broadest measures for social control, the actual achievement would be
partial and inadequate. Maladjustment is by nature a continuing problem.
We can only work toward mitigation of the severity of its consequences
and toward the reduction of the time required to make new
adj ustments.

These qualifications will doubtless seem very unsatisfactory to the
idealists; but much of our recent experience should remind us that
ideals have a price-possibly too great a price. The severest shocks
of the past generation have been due in no small measure to illusions
born of our ideals. The war developed during a period in which many
supposed that the new achievements of science and culture would make
war impossible. The war fought to end war produced a peace which


### ---Economics-1933-0-10.txt---
seems likely to end peace. Then, in the years of post-war recovery,
we were told that the new economics had eliminated the business cycle;
and many believed these new prophets of the millenium. We have suffered
many disillusionments, and made many mistakes because we have succumbed
to the spell of ideals. Too frequently ideals misdirect the action
they inspire. It would seem then that the realism of the modern liberal
can contribute much to the discussion of current problems and exert a
wholesome influence upon contemporary social policy. Though it may
arouse less enthusiasm among the masses, it is a safer guide for party
leaders and for statesmen.

The past ten years have seen changes of amazing magnitude in the
organization of American economic society. It is of one of these fundamental
alterations that I wish to speak this evening. There are doubtless
other changes of a more spectacular kind, but I doubt whether any other
is of more permanent import, both in practical results and in theoretical
interest. The change to which I refer is the lessening importance of
trade unionism in American economic organization.
I have recently compiled the statistical material relating to the membership
of American trade unions,' bringing down to 1930 the figures
which I had previously tabulated in 1914, covering the period from
1897 to 1914, and again in 1921, for the period from 1914 to 1921.2
The three studies taken together cover a period of over thirty years.
I have already explained in published articles the sources of the material.
The method used in the present study is identical with that of the
earlier compilations, and I shall not take time to describe it here.
The salient fact which emerges from these three studies may be briefly
stated. American trade unionism had always previously shown growth
in periods of prosperity. From 1897 to 1904, the membership increased
from a half million to two millions, quadrupling in seven years. The
movement had reached its end in the latter year and another forward
march did not begin until 1910. From that year until 1913 the membership
increased nearly 50 per cent. The outbreak of the European
War brought a slight recession; but in 1915 the upward movement was
resumed, and from 1915 to 1920 the membership doubled, reaching in
1920 a total of nearly five millions. Undoubtedly a large part of this
gain in membership was ephemeral, and it was to be expected that a
considerable falling off would follow. By 1924 the membership had
dropped to three and three-quarter millions. It is the years from 1924


### ---Economics-1933-1-02.txt---
to 1929 which invite attention. By all the experience of the past, an
increase of membership should have occurred in these years of plenty.
But it did not. In 1929, the membership was the same as in 1924.
Moreover, the figures for membership probably exaggerate the strength
of trade unionism in 1929. It is characteristic of this statistical series,
that there is always a lag. In periods of rising membership, the figures
do not fully reflect the increase and in periods of falling membership
they do not fully measure the decline. Moreover, the increase of 75,000
in public-service trade unions from 1924 to 1929 can hardly be counted
as an increase in trade unionism in the narrower sense, since these
unions do not use the traditional devices of trade unions. It may safely
be said that the American trade-union movement in 1924-29, for the
first time in its history, did not reflect a great period of prosperity by
a growth of membership.
The full explanation of this phenomenon is not easy, and doubtless
many factors are responsible. The first explanation which suggests itself
is that the area within which American trade unions operate successfully
has narrowed relatively to the whole field of occupations. The census
of occupations throws light on this point. From 1920 to 1930, the
total number of gainful workers increased from 41.6 millions to 48.8
millions, a gain of over seven millions or approximately 17 per cent.
Of these the gain in trade, professional service, domestic service and
clerical occupations account for over five millions; in manufacturing
and mechanical trades (including the building trades), mining, transportation
and communication, the traditional strongholds of trade
unionism, less than two millions of the newcomers found placement. The
growth of the first four groups of industries were at the rates respectively
of 40 per cent, 50 per cent, 45 per cent and 30 per cent, while in the
great fields in which trade unionism has been able to establish itself
successfully the rates of growth were 10 per cent, -10 per cent, and 20
per cent. To put the matter in another way, if we exclude agriculture,
which showed a slight decrease, forestry and fishing, a stationary group,
and public service, which showed some gain, the fields in which trade
unionism has been successful showed an increase in gainful workers
of slightly over 11 per cent, while the occupations in which trade unionism
has never been strong showed a gain of 40 per cent.
These occupational changes are in striking contrast with those from
1910 to 1920. In that period the gain in the occupations in which trade
unionism is effective was at practically the same rate as the gain in the
non-organized groups.
American trade unionism remains today as it was 30 years ago,
largely confined to the occupations included in the three census categories
of mining, manufacturing and mechanical, including the building trades,


### ---Economics-1933-1-03.txt---
and transportation. Even in the greatest period of trade-union expansion
from 1915 to 1920 when nearly 2.5 million members were added,
an insignificant part of this increase came from occupations outside the
old field. It was an intensive cultivation of an already occupied area.
If American trade unionism had retained in 1930 its control of the
fields in which it has successfully operated, it could have shown only a
small increase over 1920. That trade unionism has not been able to
expand into trade, clerical occupations, domestic and professional service
is no more a problem now than it was in 1910 or in 1920. The
reasons, or at any rate part of the reasons, are closely connected with
the relation between employer and employee and the size of the business
unit. Where in these occupational divisions the situation approximates
that in manufacturing, as for example, in the theaters, trade unionism
has shown vitality; but the number of such situations has been and remains
small.

But the failure of American trade unionism to increase its membership
during the period under consideration is not due solely to the
shifts in occupational groups which have occurred. Within the field
traditionally covered by trade-union organization, changes have taken
place which have operated powerfully against the advance of trade unionism.
In 1930, in the three fields-minerals, manufacturing and mechanical,
and transportation and communication-there were employed nearly
19 million persons as against 17 millions in 1920. These great occupational
divisions cannot be regarded, however, as homogeneous; and it is
necessary to break them down into smaller categories if an understanding
of what has happened is to be had.
The field of manufacturing and mechanical occupations includes two
radically distinct kinds of occupations-the building trades and the
manufacturing trades. The history of these two from 1924 to 1930
was entirely different and throws light on our problem. The number of
persons engaged in the building industry cannot be exactly ascertained
from the census, but such evidence as there is points to an increase in
the decade of probably 10 per cent in these occupations. The building
trades unions increased their membership from 845,000 in 1924 to
952,700 in 1930, an increase certainly fully proportionate to the gain
in the persons employed in these occupations. In 1930 the membership
in the building trades was 25 per cent of the total membership of
American trade unions, while in the year 1922 it was slightly over 20
per cent. In 1930, the building trades membership was a larger percentage
of the total membership than at any previous period. There
was not in 1930 any diminution in the power of the building trades
unions.

The strength of trade unionism in the other group of occupations


### ---Economics-1933-1-04.txt---
included in the manufacturing and mechanical trades perceptibly
diminished from 1924 to 1930. The explanation of this decline is somewhat
complicated. It is possible, as has been suggested by some, that a
part of this diminution has been due to the growth of large corporations.
Unfortunately this hypothesis cannot be fully tested by the available
statistics, since the changing proportions of persons employed by the
so-called large corporations cannot be ascertained for the occupational
groups represented by the various trade unions. It seems probable,
however, that some of the decline is due to this factor. For example,
the Bakers have undoubtedly suffered in influence from the transfer of
the baking industry from small shops to large factories controlled by
the great corporations of the baking industry. It seems probable that
the metal trades unions have suffered from the same cause.
But any careful examination of the fortunes of the individual unions
in this group reveals another factor which far outweighs in importance
the extension of the great corporation. The rapid introduction of laborsaving
machinery accompanied as it almost always is by the replacement
of skilled labor with unskilled has lessened the membership of many
of the most important American trade unions. The only great group
of trade unions in the manufacturing industries which increased its
membership in the period under review was the printing trades section,
which has suffered relatively least from this factor. Consider briefly
the trade unions included in my compilations under the heading "Chemical,
Clay, Glass and Stone." The Flint Glass Workers in 1915 had
nearly 10,000 members, a membership which they retained until 1921;
at present they have less than half as many. The Glass Bottle Blowers
have suffered a similar decline. The Operative Potters have declined
from 8,000 in pre-war years to 5,800 in 1930. The various unions in the
Window Glass trade, once a powerful aggregation, have almost entirely
disappeared. The entire trade-union membership in the Chemical, Clay,
Glass and Stone trades is today far less than it was in 1915. No considerable
loss in this group can be attributed to the growth of large
corporations. In practically all of these trades the loss is traceable
directly to the invasion of labor-saving and skill-destroying machinery.
Very few unions in the manufacturing trades have escaped some loss
from this cause. The Cigar Makers report a membership in 1930 of
15,000; in 1924, they had nearly 30,000; and in 1915, 40,000. The
Molders, who in 1924 had 34,000, now report 20,000. In all of the unions
enumerated labor-saving machinery has been introduced.
The American trade unions with few exceptions have been built on
the skilled craftsman. Where skill survives, as in the printing trades,
unionism maintains its traditional influence. In the semi-industrial unions
-such as those in the clothing trades-the introduction of machinery


### ---Economics-1933-1-05.txt---
through the diminution in the number of workers has lessened the membership
of the unions, but their strength in proportion to the number employed
remiains relatively high. But elsewhere the destruction of skill
has meant the decline in trade-union influence.
The case of the soft coal miners has been somewhat different. It has
not been so much technological improvements in the trade which has
lessened the strength of the union, as the replacement of coal as fuel
and energy-producing material, and technological changes which have
lessened demand by increasing the power and heat-producing effect of
coal. In the trades producing substitute sources of power no effective
trade unions have developed.
The trades engaged in transportation and communication furnish
another illustration of the working of the same forces. In order to understand
the history of the trade unionism in this group of occupations
it is necessary to divide the workers into two parts as they are employed
by the railroads on the one hand and by other agencies on the other.
The railroad unions experienced an enormous growth during the war
period. The total number of organized railroad workers almost doubled
from 1915 to 1921. Since then there has been a slow decline, due chiefly
to the introduction of labor-saving methods. All the operating brotherhoods
show decreases in membership since 1924. Fewer men are needed to
move the same amount of tonnage. The whole group of persons engaged in
transportation and communication increased from 3.1 millions in 1920
to 3.8 millions in 1930. A large part of this increase was due to the increasing
use of the automobile and truck as an agency of transportation.
But the one great union representing this new form of transportationthe
Teamsters-has shown only a very moderate growth since 1923. The
Street and Electric Railway Union has shown a small decline, fully accounted
for by the decrease in the numbers engaged in this service.
We can summarize the history of American trade unionism in this
period of prosperity as follows:
(1) The iricrease in the number of occupied persons was predominantly
in fields in which trade unionism has never been able successfully
to organize any considerable number of persons.
(2) Within the traditional field of trade unionism, the loss in many
unions has been heavy owing to the introduction of labor-saving and
skill-destroying machinery. The latter feature of the movement has been
particularly important.
(3) Much the same effect has been caused by technological improvements
which have lessened the markets for goods produced by unions
of skilled craftsmen.
The history of American trade unionism in the past 30 years is
roughly epitomized by the figures for the per cent which trade-union


### ---Economics-1933-1-06.txt---
membership is of the whole number of persons gainfully employed. In
1900, it was 3 per cent; in 1910, 5.6 per cent; in 1920, over 12 per cent;
and in 1930, 8 per cent.
We may briefly summarize the present situation as follows: American
trade unionism is slowly being limited in influence by changes which
destroy the basis on which it is erected. It is probable that changes
in the law have adversely affected unionism. Certainly the growth of
large corporations has done so. But no one who carefully follows the
fortunes of individual unions can doubt that over and above these influences,
the relative decline in the power of American trade unionism
is due to occupational changes and to technological revolutions.
It would be interesting to speculate on the possibility that American
trade unionism as a whole could organize on some other basis than that
on which it has organized itself from the beginning of its history. It
is possible that something like the Knights of Labor may emerge and
dominate American trade-union organization. Many writers have counseled
the leaders of the American trade-union movement to abandon their
present forms of organization and to move in the direction of industrial
trade unionism. There are no indications that anything of this kind
will happen in the near future. The changes-occupational and technological-
which checked the advance of trade unionism in the last decade
appear likely to continue in the same direction. It is hazardous to
prophesy, but I see no reason to believe that American trade unionism
will so revolutionize itself within a short period of time as to become
in the next decade a more potent social influence than it has been in the
past decade. This is by no means to say that trade unionism in the
United States is on its way to insignificance as a social factor.
If then we may take it as probable that trade unionism is likely to
be a declining influence in determining the conditions of labor in general,
it is pertinent to inquire briefly what effect this change is likely to
have upon the development of the conditions of labor in the United
States. During the last 50 years, economists, with a greater approach
to unanimity than is customary among us, have assigned to trade
unionism a highly beneficent role in the development of a sound economic
structure. It is true that there have been differences in emphasis upon
the different aspects of the work which a sound trade unionism is assumed
to do. In the main, however, these may be reduced to two lines of thought.
The first school, if I may so dignify the matter, has assumed that
the weakness of the laborer in bargaining puts him at a disadvantage
in dealing with his employer and that a fair wage emerges only between
parties of equal bargaining power. The trade union, it is argued, furnishes
the needed addition to the bargaining power of the laborer. This form
of apologia goes far back in the literature and is sanctioned by many
honored names.


### ---Economics-1933-1-07.txt---
The second school of thought conceives the trade union more as
an instrument of social progress, and less as a means of redressing
the balance in individual situations. The argument runs somewhat as
follows: The labor contract in recent years has become more complex
than formerly. It embraces not merely the monetary element ordinarily
known as wages but the non-monetary elements of the amount of employment,
accidents, occupational disease, etc. It is primarily the
business of trade unionism to establish the conditions surrounding these
non-monetary elements in the labor contract. When these are standardized
for a particular trade, the strictly monetary element of wages will
need less effort. Moreover, and this is perhaps the most important part
of the argument, these non-monetary elements can ordinarily be brought
into standard form only for labor as a whole by legislative action.
The role of the trade union should be to experiment with and establish
these standard conditions in the non-monetary parts of the labor contract.
Compensation for industrial accidents and disease, standardization
of the hours of labor, unemployment insurance, old-age pensions
established and regulated by the state constitute the goal toward which
the trade union is to be the formative agency.
If the foregoing views are correct, the failure of trade unionism to
expand may be partially offset by the adoption by the American states
of systems of compuls,ory &ocial insurance. To be sure, the problem
of exploited labor in certain industries seems impossible of solution in
the face of the decision of the Supreme Court that minimum wage laws
are ulnconstitutional. But the setting up of systems of social insurance
would enormously improve the bargaining power of labor.
The trade-union movement in the United States has in the past by no
means adopted this view of the future of the labor movement. A few
trade unions have made notable contributions in this field. The system
of old-age pensions in the printing trades, and the unemployment insurance
scheme developed by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers have
been important experiments. It was only natural that trade-union leaders
should for so long have indulged the proud hope that the trade unions
could themselves administer adequate systems of insurance. But the
recent declarations of the American Federation of Labor can leave no
doubt that the position of American trade unionism has changed.
The greater part of the large corporations in this country have
maintained systems of old-age pensions for their employees; and some
of them have attempted to establish systems of unemployment insurance.
The need for such provision is clear to their minds. Is it not obvious to
both business men and workmen that piecemeal attempts to provide
for such contingencies as unemployment and old age fail to meet the
situation? We are dealing here with a social problem and not a problem
of an individual trade or business. The events of the past three years


### ---Economics-1933-1-08.txt---
have spoken eloquently in favor of this view. May we not hope that the
decade before us will see employers and trade unions jointly urging
upon the legislatures of our states the establishment of social insurance
systems?

Classical and neo-classical economic theory is commonly associated
with a form of liberalism that was more largely directed toward the
repeal of old laws and regulations than to the constructive development
of institutions to meet new social problems. In the past the chief emphasis
has been laid upon these destructive accomplishments of economic
liberalism. It has therefore been easy to overlook the actual constructive
accomplishments of the early nineteenth century, and many are disposed
to believe that these positive achievements were inconsistent with
the primary postulates of classical and neo-classical theory. It must
be confessed that there is confusion of thought in the writings of the
early nineteenth century economists; but a positive theory of constructive
statecraft is implicit in the basic liberal concepts. The most characteristic
features of classical theory lead directly toward a broad concept
of the task of the state.
Classical theory was based upon the concept of an orderly and rational
system of nature, and the concept of a contractual society. We
need not concern ourselves here with the precise forms in which these
concepts were held by the economists of the nineteenth century, because
it is more important to direct our attention to the full content of these
ideas than to the imperfect and incomplete formulations that have prevented
liberal views from achieving their full development.
The science and philosophy of the nineteenth century has greatly
enlarged the scope of both of these fundamental concepts. The philosophy
of nature has been profoundly changed by the development of the
chemical and biological sciences and by the new achievements of astronomy.
Bare mechanical categories of cause and effect have been supplemented
by concepts of adaptation, and of reciprocal determination.
Concepts of absolute laws of nature have been softened so that we now
recognize that the scope of any particular generalization is conditioned
by its place in some system of relations. We recognize, too, that no single
system of relations exhausts all possible interests or interpretations.
In like fashion our attitude toward social and economic institutions
has been profoundly transformed since the publication of the Wealth


### ---Economics-1934-0-02.txt---
of Nations. The development of the concept of evolution has exerted its
most direct influence upon economics by placing institutions in a new
light. The older writers commonly refer to the "existing" institutions,
or to the "existing" system of private property. The explicit descriptions
of the institutional system were thus static, and rarely is there
any positive recognition of historical process in the sense of continuous
change. Even the most devoted adherents of pure theory, today, recognize
the fact of historical development and the essentially dynamic
quality of the basic phenomena of economic life. We are all familiar
with secular trends, cyclical movements, and incidental fluctuations and
variations. These phenomena can now be distinguished explicitly even
though full analysis is still incomplete.
But although the basic postulates of theory have been restated in
much more sophisticated forms, they have not lost their identity. In
fact, we might even say that we are only beginning to appreciate the
full significance of the concepts of the early classical writers. The concept
of social evolution is deeply imbedded in their thought, despite
certain infelicities of expression and despite their failure to follow out
the implications of what was at the time a novel and unfamiliar idea.
The utilitarian concepts of Bentham and John Stuart Mill express, in
addition to many other things, a specific concept of social adaptation.
Both Bentham and Mill achieved notable concepts of an historical process.
They recognized that specific institutions may possess constructive
social significance-utility-at a particular period which they may at
a later time cease to possess because of social change. The utility of particular
institutions thus becomes a criterion for the legislator in considering
social policy; institutions which have lost their utility should
be discontinued, those which promise to be useful may be established
or developed. Mill's discussion of rights of property contains important
historical implications, though historical facts are not stressed at any
point. The entire discussion rests upon an explicit concept of historical
development in which the state may play an active and constructive
part.

In other respects, too, the notion of historical process appears in the
classical writing. The references to institutions are, indeed, couched in
essentially static terms, but references are made to different moments in
the process of social evolution. The process is always thought of as a
whole, and this sense of unity was so strongly felt that the writers were
not conscious of the dangers and ambiguities involved in neglecting to
distinguish between the moments of reference. In discussing such an
historical process there are three primary moments of reference that
are especially useful in abstract analysis. We may refer to the process
at its beginning, when we assume that all its content is implicit; we may


### ---Economics-1934-0-03.txt---
refer to our own present, when much development has taken place,
though many features of the entire system are incomplete and imperfect;
or, using our imagination, we may refer to the ultimate achievement of
the full content of the process, when we presume that all the imperfections
and inadequacies have been overcome and the system stands
forth in its full perfection.
The assumption that economic generalizations were valid througlhout
the historical period rested upon the concept of the unity of the process
of institutional development. The ultimate achievement was taken to be
no more than an expression of relationships which exist at all times and
places irrespective of the institutional devices required for their manifestation.
With such assumptions it was obviously a matter of indifference
whether abstract analysis concerned itself with the bare relations
implicit in social life or with their objective manifestation in a fully
developed institutional system. One might discuss either the economic
phenomena of primitive society or the operations of the perfected system
of private property and contract which would ultimately emerge
when the obsolete survivals of the feudal order had been entirely eliminated
by liberal reform.

This position had elements of logical significance. But there was little
positive defense for the common presumption that the process as a whole
could be thought of as the existing order. To assume that the given moment
could be identified with the ultimate end of the process, involved
the tacit assumption that the process was already approximately complete,
so that the developments of the future were really negligible. This
is a dangerous assumption, but it is by no means an uncommon tendency
of idealists. The imagination is not so severely taxed if it seems certain
that the consummation of all hopes is awaiting "just around the corner."
The nineteenth century liberals were thinking in terms of a final achievement
of the free society in the immediate future.
Underlying all these confused references to the history of institutions
there was thus a positive concept of evolution that was truly remarkable.
For most of these notions appeared before there was any systematic
theory of social evolution. Accordingly, we are justified in feeling
that the explicit development of the theory of social evolution is no more
than a working out of ideas which were significantly present in the classical
writing. There is positive continuity of thought.
The transition from the early form of liberal doctrine to the latter
form involves only two new elements. We must recognize that we cannot
refer indifferently to any particular moment in the process as if it
stood for the whole. Although we may properly discuss the phenomena
at any stage, and although our discussions will have some significance
for the analysis of the process in its entirety, each of the various moments

in the process must be distinguished. We should always be clear
in our minds as to the moment of reference; whether it be the beginning,
the end, or the specific present. The need for this accuracy in statement
scarcely requires elaboration. It is really no more than common
intellectual tidiness.
The second element of novelty involves a genuine development of doctrine.
It is important to recognize the insufficiency of a concept of social
evolution that involves nothing more than the explicit manifestation of
elements that are all present at the beginning. The notion that the totality
of relations is implicit at the outset has many logical attractions,
but the historical consequences are serious. If it be true that the
end of the process is implicit at the beginning nothing really new actually
happens. Time and history would, in this case, merely display a
sequence of events which follow each other by mechanical necessity. The
difficulties involved in such a view have been extensively explored by
Bergson and other modern philosophers; and the earlier concept of process
so brilliantly expressed by Hegel must be deemed unsatisfactory.
We must adopt some concept of historical process that recognizes the
accumulation of new elements around a basic nucleus. The precise detail
of the process is not important for the particular problem in hand,
once it is acknowledged that new things happen and that the movement
of history is not a mechanical display of unconscious cosmic force. We
must, however, find some means of assimilating definitely new elements
to the moving process. Otherwise life and history are no more than a
rigidly prescribed pilgrimage of grace. The concept of evolution implicit
in the classical economics was too thin to exhibit its most significant
properties. There was so much mechanical necessity in its movement
that it afforded too little scope for the positive activities of either state
or individual. There was adaptation, but of a passive kind that was
scarcely more than a mechanical response to the material or the social
environment. The adjustments even of individuals were commonly assumed
to involve no more conscious choice than a narrow mathematical
calculation of profits and losses. Once we recognize the reality of innovation
over wide fields of activity, the significance of constructive activities
of both state and individuals becomes strikinglv clear.
The acceptance of the evolutionary concept in any broad form requires
us to assume that the end of the process of development is remote.
The present moment cannot be identified with the end of the process. We
cannot assume that our institutions are approximately mature and adequate,
so that the imperfections of social organization can be deemed
negligible for purposes of theoretical analysis. It is essential that we
should be keenly conscious that the imperfections of adjustment are
important and that positive, conscious action is essential to overcome


### ---Economics-1934-0-05.txt---
them. Further, any given society will always find its institutional mechanisms
inadequate and imperfect, because changing conditions create new
needs and problems for which self-regulating mechanisms cannot instantly
be created. Regulation is thus essential even in a society that tends
to be self-regulating.
Closely associated with this fact of imperfection in social organization
is the problem of monopoly. Though generally recognized and extensively
discussed, monopoly was assumed to be a mere incidental intrusion
into a social system that was predominantly and naturally competitive.
The older theory assumed monopoly to be foreign to the natural
order of a contractual society, though both natural and legal monopolies
were recognized. This position was in part justified by the older
theoretical contention that monopoly price emerged only under conditions
of substantially complete control of supply. All intermediate conditions
between pure competition and pure monopoly were presumed to
reveal an essentially competitive price structure. Recent developments
in theoretical analysis have completely overthrown this view; and we
must consequently recognize that important monopolistic powers emerge
over an extensive range of cases of monopolistic competition. We are
thus forced to recognize that society is not inherently competitive. The
range of effective competition is much narrower than was long supposed,
and doubtless we may say with truth that competition has never been
effectively organized over the major part of trade and commerce. The
regulation of monopoly is thus a much more important field of activity
than the classical economists assumed it to be, and their own principles
now require an extension of the activity of the state far beyond any
limits that they would have supposed to be essential.
The modern liberal thus believes that social evolution is a constructive
process which involves active participation of both individuals and state.
There is no guiding hand other than the collective wisdom of each generation.
By reason of persistent imperfection and maladjustment, the
remedial activities of the state must needs be extensive; anld, as monopoly
is ever present over a wide field, vigorous regulation is essential to the
protection of the welfare of the public. Modern liberalism thus presents
an entirely new outlook on life, despite a certain continuity of thought
that really reaches back to the sixteenth century philosophy of the
Commonweal.

The full significance of these extensions of the range of state activity
will be more explicitly perceived if we turn to some contemporary problems.
Any development of national planning might seem to be wholly
inconsistent with the basic concepts of liberalism. Planned or regulated
production of certain basic mineral products can be urged by the liberal
on two important counts: conservation of primary resources in the


### ---Economics-1934-0-06.txt---
interest of society as a whole, and the regulation of the monopolistic
conditions almost certain to arise in the large-scale enterprises based on
these mineral deposits.
Many are disposed to question the possibility of assimilating national
planning even in basic industries to the so-called "competitive"
structure of modern society. These doubts ignore many of the realities
of the industrial development of the last forty years. National planning
has long existed in important fields both in this country and in Germany.
If we consider the actual conditions in the iron and steel industry
of the United States since 1890, and forget for the moment all the sophistications
created by the Sherman law and the Supreme Court, it is
fairly evident that the leaders of the industry have deliberately controlled
the rate of investment in the industry, the balance of facilities
for the production of the primary classes of products, and the approximate
rate of annual production. We cannot legally admit that this is
the case, but such is the simplest description of what has actually taken
place. On the whole, there can be little doubt of the essential wisdom
of these arrangements and no little credit is due the industrialists and
jurists by whose ingenuity these activities were brought within the law.
In Germany, of course, the activities of the cartels and large-scale industries
are still more evident, and the nationalization of various industries
since the war is a notable demonstration of planning. In these fields
national planning does not really involve any bureaucratic control of
the details of industrial organization, but merely recognizes the presence
of monopoly or monopolistic competition. The normal sphere of direct
governmental activity would thus be the regulation of the monopolized
industry in the interest of the public.
The general concepts of liberalism are certainly not inconsistent with
an extension of regulated monopoly to transportation and to the production
of oil, coal, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and electricity. Both
England and Germany are already far in advance of us in respect of
the development of interconnected production and distribution of electricity.
The policies of these countries are certainly more consistent with
liberal principle than the policy or absence of policy that has until the
present year characterized our activities in these fields.
Closely associated with these problems is the question of the nature
of the rights of private property. Wild-cat oil production has been
defended in this country for two generations because any interference
with the individual would constitute a confiscation of property. This
reasoning ignores entirely some of the simplest aspects of comparative
jurisprudence. There is no general principle of law by which surface
rights are inevitably extended to underlying minerals. In Spanish colonial
law all property in minerals vested in the crown. All persons were entitled
to search for minerals, and authorized to exploit minerals discovered


### ---Economics-1934-0-07.txt---
upon payment of certain dues to the government. In Cornwall,
and in the lead mining area of the Mendip hills, surface owners had
no exclusive rights to undiscovered minerals nor any right to prevent
the search for minerals. Rights to the precious metals in England vested
in the crown, and at a critical period in the sixteenth century coal
barely escaped inclusion within the category of mines royal. The precise
limits of rights of property are not very specifically defined. Limits
vary in different jurisdictions and at various times. The redefinition of
these limits constitutes one of the most interesting and significant aspects
in the evolu-tion of our modern contractual society. Recognition of the
fact of social development necessarily commits the liberal to continuous
redefinition of the rights of property. This important feature of public
policy was clearly perceived by John Stuart Mill when he said "the
institution of private property can be improved."
The uncertain future of the gold standard and the current discussion
of various forms of managed currencies raise issues which carry
us more specifically beyond classical theory. The automatic gold standard
was intimately bound into the early liberal concept of a self-regulated
society in which government control and interference were casual and
exceptional. The modern analysis of credit would seem to involve a
serious break with characteristic liberal concepts. It certainly involves
a complete abandonment of a concept of social adjustment produced
by individual acts and choices in which the specific personal interest
is the sole basis of the judgment or choice. Each individual by following
his own interests was presumed to promote the achievement of a
general social welfare that was never consciously considered by anyone,
whether individual or government official. This view was vividly
expressed in respect of banking policy. The function of the bank was
reduced to the task of supplying the credit demanded by the trader;
and, though it was recognized that only "legitimate" demands must
be granted, this qualification meant merely that only bona fide commercial
paper based on actual goods might safely be discounted. The
banker was thus merely the passive servant of the trader. Under these
circumstances, the government need merely insist upon the maintenance
of the convertibility of credit into gold, by preventing imprudent issue
of notes or imprudent neglect of reserves.
None of the outstanding modern analyses of credit accept such a passive
concept of banking policy. It is pretty generally recognized that
banking involves not only serving the trader but in a measure directing
the general course of his activities. Management of the currency is an
inescapable necessity. The present problem is to discover the true objectives
of currency management, and to discover appropriate means of
credit control.

The enlarged concepts of the system of nature bring new elements


### ---Economics-1934-0-08.txt---
to the description and analysis of the processes of economic and social
adjustment; but the changes affect details rather than essentials. The
early identification of liberalism with the doctrine of non-interference
was due to a misconception of the process of adaptation. The restatement
of liberal doctrine is thus a correction of an unfortunate error; a
necessary enlargement of the concepts of nature and social process.
We must recognize that both individual and social adjustment is the
result of conscious effort. Although we can reconcile the achievement
of individual ends with the welfare of society as a whole, it does not
follow that general welfare can be achieved without positive thought and
effort, as a mere residual consequence of the enlightened selfishness of
individuals. It is no longer possible to accept any concept of a mechanical
self-regulating society that excludes the state as an agency of change.
The state must needs be an active participant in social process.
The recognition of such extensive fields for the activity of the state
may seem to destroy all distinction between liberalism and various forms
of nationalism and radicalism. Important differences still remain, both
in principle and practice. The liberal concept of the function of the
state and of social process is realistic. Statecraft is treated as a process
of adjustment and adaptation. The only aim is the achievement at
each moment of the greatest measure of social welfare, national and
international.

Other concepts of statecraft are frankly idealistic. The nationalist
sees only the national state as an end of social and economic policy.
The socialist sees some form of socialist state. The radical pursues
various ideals according to his lights. None of these systems of statecraft
sufficiently recognize the limitations imposed upon our conscious
action by objective circumstance. All these systems of thought assumc
that society can be made to conform to some abstract ideal. The statesman
is presumed to be able to accomplish his will. Since the days of
Jean Bodin liberals have steadfastly opposed this concept of social
process. They have endeavored to demonstrate the ways in which the
development of social life and social organization are modified by external
circumstance. They have endeavored to analyze historical process and
economic phenomena, so that by the cunning of reason the laws of nature
nay be made a means to our social ends. But we conquer nature only
through the understanding of her ways. Social development is not a
demonstration of the superiority of the mind over matter: conscious
activity is itself an aspect of the system of nature.
The enlargement of the concepts of historical process and of the
system of nature do not modify in any essential respect the general
issues between the liberal and the idealists. The analysis of the localization
of industry based upon liberal principles affords no grounds for


### ---Economics-1934-0-09.txt---
presuming the antagonisms of economic interest that are assumed by the
nationalists. Nor is there any basis for the assumption that the primary
features of the territorial division of labor can be significantly modified
or controlled by protective tariffs. At the most, tariff measures can
soften the shocks produced by technological changes. These effects are
certainly not negligible, but they do not play the dominant part in economic
development presumed by the nationalists.
The hope of the socialist that poverty can and will be abolished seems
to the modern liberal merely an ungrounded act of faith; significant as
a motive for reforms, but incapable of realization. The objective limitations
to the satisfaction of our wants rest upon costs rather than
upon absolute scarcity. Former ages seldom experienced an absolute lack
of necessities: in the world as a whole there was bitter want in particular
localities, because the commodities needed were available only in a relatively
distant region. Technological improvement changes the incidence
of scarcity and of cost, but it affords no guarantee that all the requisite
commodities can be placed in the hands of all consumers under conditions
of cost compatible with the functioning of society. Scarcity has
always been relative: and in this sense it remains a permanent economic
problem. Cost must needs appear in any form of society, even though
the rules of allocation are changed. The fact that some of the costs of
the Soviet electric plant on the Dnieper were not borne by the industry
itself, does not mean that they do not exist as a factor in the budget
of the state and in the supply of consumer goods available to the people.
It is doubtless within the power of society to relieve the more extreme
forms of destitution, but there are positive limits to actual accomplishment.
The Webbs and others have shown that destitution is essentially
a phase of maladjustment. This is in part due to social deficiencies,
but in part due to the failure of the individual to meet the requirements
of his environment. Remedial measures can be applied to most of these
problems, but, even if there were no resistance to the application of the
broadest measures for social control, the actual achievement would be
partial and inadequate. Maladjustment is by nature a continuing problem.
We can only work toward mitigation of the severity of its consequences
and toward the reduction of the time required to make new
adj ustments.

These qualifications will doubtless seem very unsatisfactory to the
idealists; but much of our recent experience should remind us that
ideals have a price-possibly too great a price. The severest shocks
of the past generation have been due in no small measure to illusions
born of our ideals. The war developed during a period in which many
supposed that the new achievements of science and culture would make
war impossible. The war fought to end war produced a peace which


### ---Economics-1934-0-10.txt---
seems likely to end peace. Then, in the years of post-war recovery,
we were told that the new economics had eliminated the business cycle;
and many believed these new prophets of the millenium. We have suffered
many disillusionments, and made many mistakes because we have succumbed
to the spell of ideals. Too frequently ideals misdirect the action
they inspire. It would seem then that the realism of the modern liberal
can contribute much to the discussion of current problems and exert a
wholesome influence upon contemporary social policy. Though it may
arouse less enthusiasm among the masses, it is a safer guide for party
leaders and for statesmen.

I hope you will pardon me if I seem to talk shop. I disclaim talking the
shop of that branch of the federal service with which I am at present connected.
Yet I cannot avoid the appearance of talking shop; for my views are
quite as much the result of experience and observation in industry as of
reading and reflection in my study.
The nation under the New Deal stresses collective action. The National
Industrial Recovery act permits business men to come to grips collectively
with problems which have baffled them as individuals. Section 7 (a) seeks
to safeguard the right of employees to collective bargaining. Associations,
codes of fair competition, price maintenance schemes, labor unions and employee
representation plans have developed in hot-house profusion.
The New Deal and the hope of rapid recovery stirred up the trade unions
and, more important, fired the courage of workers in many localities and industries
where unionism had never existed or had long been quiescent. There
especially the challenge of unionism encountered renewed resistance from
employers, their lawyers and economic counsel. A race developed between
so-called legitimate unions and so-called company unions, with statistical
results not accurately known. The fact is, however, that in the United States
there are now more employee representation plans, with a larger attached
membership than ever before and more unions with a larger membership
than ever before, except for a few years at the close of the war period when
union membership was in excess of 5,000,000. And the race has not come
to an end; most certainly not the clash between rival forms of organization
for collective bargaining, accompanied by hectic argument over "majority
rule," "proportional representation," "minority rights," "individual rights,"
and all the rest of it. Collective bargaining is under discussion more than at
any other time in our history, and this discussion promises to remain rife for
some years to come. I shall make brief observations on some phases of this
subject. Lack of time forbids discussion of forms of labor organization and
of governmental policy.
Before proceeding to the economic phases, permit me to remark that the


### ---Economics-1935-0-02.txt---
interests of workers in collective bargaining may not be limited to details of
the labor contract. To unionists generally, collective bargaining means something
in addition to wages, hours, tenure, and working conditions. For it
establishes a new "government in industry," "industrial democracy," "representative
government," "citizenship in industry," to employ a few of the
more frequently used terms. If citizens have a voice and a vote in political
affairs, why should they not have voice and vote in industry? The demand
for recognition and collective bargaining is regarded, and now safeguarded,
as a democratic right. This statement is made because unionism should not
be disposed of entirely on economic grounds, to which from this point on I
shall confine my remarks.
Three stages, or shifts of emphasis, are discernible in the evolution of the
union theory of collective bargaining.
Its first or simplest form emphasized the need of equality of bargaining
power between employer and employee. Labor spokesmen stressed the view
that the wage-earner under modern industrial conditions is a weak and incompetent
bargainer, possessed of little more than an ineffective veto power
in the refusal to accept employment on the terms offered and in the right to
quit the job when dissatisfied. The individual worker, as compared to the
employer, they say, is ignorant of the market situation and of employment
opportunities; he has little or no reserve power in funds in hand; he fears to
push a claim vigorously for fear of discrimination or loss of job; he is likely
to reason that it is better to accept or retain employment on adverse terms
than to lose working time altogether; he finds himself pitted against other
seekers of work, and the cheaper man is the successful bidder; if he has employment,
the terms of his contract, like the railway time-table, are "subject
to change without notice."
Naturally enough, the average unionist's case for collective bargaining has
run largely in terms of the concrete instance, the personal factor, "big business"
versus the economically small workman, and the short run. But,
thanks largely to intellectual friends such as Mr. and Mrs. Webb, and to experience
in a complicated world, the union spokesmen have had more and
more regard for the longer run and market considerations. Thus their second
stage has brought them to a realization of the need for control due to industrial
and market organization and the pressure of market competition. They
realize that the average employer, however appreciative of the value of good
working conditions and the needs of his workers, is under the necessity of
reducing costs because of the money-saving, chiseling practices of his less
socially-minded competitors. Competition frequently prevents employers
from doing what they would like to do in labor matters. Hence, nowadays,
we hear relatively less of balancing bargaining power between the employer
and his employees, and more of the need for standardization and control, of
placing all firms in a market on pretty much the same plane of labor costs,


### ---Economics-1935-0-03.txt---
and of having competitive success depend largely upon managerial ability,
sound organization and the like.
The characteristic union emphasis on the weakness of the individual
bargainer and the necessity for concerted action as a defense against market
forces has generally been at the neglect of the other side of the picture
placed before the public. Under collective bargaining the workers' representative
may not only be free from any fear of injury at the hands of management,
but he may be, and very frequently is, the better informed and more
skillful bargainer in so far as labor matters are concerned. The union, by
providing strike benefits, gives reserve power and ability to strike; and
more important, by preaching solidarity and building up and sustaining
morale, it may develop the will as well as the power "to see things through."
The supply of labor may be controlled, and competition for work restricted
and employment rationed in a variety of ways-among them, the closed
shop, closed union books, high initiation fees, restrictive rules relating to
apprentices and helpers. Unions, like employers and politicians, dislike
too much competition. Finally, under collective agreements, changes to
the disadvantage of the workers cannot readily be made without due notice
and consent; terms of employment and perhaps tenure of job cease to be
"at will."

As seen by the trade unionist, who acts upon a bargaining theory of
wages and who, like the business man, generalizes from concrete experience
in industry, there is, therefore, a tremendous difference between the results
of unrestrained individual bargaining and the results to be obtained
through concerted action. As John Mitchell said, "Trade unionism thus recognizes
that the destruction of the workman is the individual bargain, and
the salvation of the working man is the joint, united, collective bargain."'
Thus it is claimed that collective bargaining is necessary to equalize bargaining
power between workers and employer, to standardize terms of employment
as a basis for fair competition, to reduce pressure in the trade
or industry, and to stabilize the employment relationship.
To this statement of the case, now decades old, the American unions
have added a third argument-that wages must be increased in proportion
to increases in industrial efficiency in order to balance consumption and
production and to maintain the necessary market outlet for industrial products.
2 Officially adopted as a labor doctrine by the American Federation of
Labor in 1925, it has been accepted by many business men, not a few economists
and obviously by many persons holding public office. The same is
true of a related but inharmonious doctrine to the effect that in depression
maintaining or increasing wages is necessary to maintain or to effect an increase


### ---Economics-1935-0-04.txt---
in purchasing power, which is the appropriate road to recovery. The
role these doctrines have of late been playing in public affairs is well known.
Now what have economists to say concerning the theory of collective
bargaining as thus set forth? And what shall one say of what economists
say?

It need hardly be remarked that present-day economists find a less unimportant
place for unionism and its theory of collective bargaining than did
those of earlier generations. Indeed, some of them find an important role
for collective dealing in employment relationships. Yet, most economists,
in the language of Professor Smart, when reviewing the Webbs' Industrial
Democracy, would ask whether the case does not prove too much.3 They
have been at pains to show the theory's neglect of important factors, such
as the competitive demand for labor, and the limited control that can be
exercised; and they criticize the exaction of unjustified differential advantages
and a warped national economy. A few present-day economists are
indeed not far removed from Cairnes of 1870; they see practically no opportunity
for collective control if very harmful results are not to follow.
Economists, as has been said of professors, are men "who think otherwise."
In this brief discussion only a few of the more important questions raised
by economists can receive consideration. Differences among economic
theorists cannot be definitely followed up.
Is collective bargaining needed to defend the workers' interests? The
theory of wages held by most economists runs largely in terms of marginal
productivity. According to this theory, each employer has reason to hire
labor and to purchase other factors needed in his business up to that point
where the value of the contribution of each unit of labor or other factor
is substantially the same as its cost. In an ideal state and in the absence of
friction, there is active competition for labor until this results, not only in
the given plant but in all plants in all industries. Hence, whatever may be
the forces affecting the supplies of labor and the other factors in production
and whatever really determines the prices of products, wages tend to
conform to marginal productivity.4 The weak are protected, and approximately
fair wages as between industries are obtained-in so far as competitive
demand is effective.
Thus the economist emphasizes a factor-demand-not sufficiently emphasized
by the labor spokesman or the "labor economist." This factor must
be emphasized if the facts regarding wages, say, during the last 50 or 100
years are to be explained. The demand for labor, enlarged by increasing
capital invested and better utilized resources, has caused more and more
workers to be absorbed into industry at increased wages as the generations


### ---Economics-1935-0-05.txt---
have passed. Labor has shared in the gains resulting from economic progress.
Yet the tendency for wages, because of the nature of the demand for
labor, to approximate labor's contribution does not necessarily mean that
labor's interests are adequately protected.
This brings me to my first critical comment on the theorizing and still
more the conclusions relating to policy emanating from many of my clansmen.


Permit me to observe that it is a curious fact, explained perhaps by undue
emphasis upon a narrow price economics, that economists generally have
been prone to discuss collective bargaining, the need for it, and what it
can and what it cannot accomplish, in terms of wages only. Wages are
only one detail in the labor contract and employment situation. Though
wages are certainly of first consideration in an age of scarcity, hours of
work, tenure, and general working conditions are vital to the working
man. Query: Do economic forces operate in such a way as to conserve these
other interests as they are supposed to do for wages?
T1he answer is a qualified No. The fact is, I believe, that a competitive
demand for labor does not go far in protecting the workers against long
hours, overtime, fines, discharge without sufficient cause, and objectionable
working conditions. This is explained in part by the fact that employers as
a rule are not actively interested in the long-run effects of hours and working
conditions because of a lack of accurate knowledge of these effects and
because the labor contract is ordinarily terminable at will. In so far as hours
are concerned, there is fear that a reduction means reduced output or that
one reduction will develop interest in another. That it is exceedingly difficult
to return to a longer day or week when a short one has been in use is
well known.

The explanation is found in part also in the fact that workers accept employment
chiefly in view of rate of pay and possible earnings and of accessibility
of the place of employment. Long hours, much overtime, discrimination,
inconsiderate discipline, and bad working conditions may give rise to
a large turnover of labor due to many quitting; but such a turnover has not
generally led management to ascertain causes and to remedy them. Do we
not find twenty firms with neat turnover figures for one that seriously uses
them in an attempt to improve management?
Finally, the explanation is found in part in the fact that there is usually
keen competition in the market for the product as well as competition for
help. In order to extend business, to hold business, to meet the needs and
whims of customers with reference to style and delivery, to make favorable
prices and to maintain profits and dividends, these things are likely to be

ters mentioned "are not adequately determined by the market processhours
of work and conditions of work are things that intimately concern
workmen and are best decided collectively."5
Returning now to a discussion of wages and collective bargaining, it is to
be noted that according to the economic theory briefly stated above, there is
a tendency for wages to equal the value-product of labor at the margin.
Economists generally do not contend, however, that this tendency fully safeguards
the wage-interest of the workers. They recognize the element of friction
in the real situation. Some attach much more importance to friction
than do others. In my opinion, and I think in the opinion of most able and
experienced employers also, it is of greater importance than is generally
recognized by our fraternity. Put in other words, the demand for labor is
not as effective in safeguarding the workers' interest in wages as most
economic theorists seem to think, if not to contend.
In a boom period, when prices are rising and profits are good, business
is very active and bidding for labor generally becomes keen. It may develop
to the point of stealing help. At such times rates of pay advance rapidly.
But in more normal times, though progress is being made and most
workers are finding employment, wage advances are hesitantly offered, and
there is more or less room for under-payment, even for a considerable degree
of exploitation. For there are groups with limited mobility, and new
accessions to the labor supply and displaced workers are more or less
eagerly seeking employment on such terms as their limited individual
bargaining ability will secure for them. It may then well be that there are
no well-defined standards of wages in certain industries and in many localities.
For long periods labor tends to be absorbed into the industry or locality
with limited relation to wages paid elsewhere. Within one industry or
locality there are the lower obstructive wages paid by the hard-boiled managers.
Piece-rates are nibbled here and there, more work or better quality
is required, and the worker is stretched out. All the while in most plants
there is a bad rate structure, slowly corrected, when corrected at all. The
fact is that wages depend to a considerable extent upon the policies of the
employers, as so many investigators have found in concrete situations. To
secure evidence, study, among others, the needle trades, the bituminous
coal industry, the cleaning and dyeing industry, the laundry trade, the manufacture
of candy, and the cotton textile industry.
Furthermore, the economic theorist assumes in much or in all of his
analysis that there is no element of monopoly or concerted control in the
demand for labor or in fixing wages. This is by no means true. An employer,
or a group of employers acting in concert or just individually fearing
to create problems, may dominate the employment situation in a community.
So it was in the mining of anthracite coal between the middle

### ---Economics-1935-0-07.txt---
seventies and the turn of the century. Wages were pegged; payment for
timbering and "dead work" was reduced or eliminated altogether; coerced
purchases at company stores charging high prices, and powder sold at a
profit of 200 per cent, took the larger part of the earnings of the miners.
Even in a city like Chicago, an industry may dominate a large community
and the firms engaged in it may control the situation within rather wide
limits. Going beyond this, I could cite a number of instances where associations
of manufacturers or merchants have fixed scales or, indeed, maximum
wages to be paid and have enforced them more successfully than any
American state has enforced its minimum wage standards. How many such
instances there are no one can know, but there is good reason to believe that
they are not so highly exceptional as the uninitiated think. They have significance
in the real world of employment. Yet, it is true that, though imperfect,
a competition for labor exists. And, of course, the productivity
theory of wages also remains essentially true, however little it may really
tell the curious who wish to have wages explained. The point is that the
element of friction, as the theorist calls it, is of real significance in connection
with wages, where the operation of market forces is more likely to
conserve the workers' welfare than their interests in hours and working
conditions.

What I have said relates chiefly to the need for collective bargaining to
defend the workers' interest. Most unions, however, are often not defending
the wages they have had, but are on the offensive to get more; not infrequently,
emphatically more. "Heavens, what is your limit?" cried the head
of a great industry, in a collective bargaining conference. "No limit," replied
the union chief, "the same as yours." Unions are usually trying to get
better differentials for their own members. Their success in getting such
differentials is one of the larger facts in collective bargaining.
Hence the criticisms-too severe in my opinion-by most business men
and also most economists, of unionism, the differentials the union secures,
and the resulting utilization of productive capacity.
There is little criticism of the standardization of wages as such; but
there is much criticism of unjustified differentials and of enhancement of
wages on the ground that these will increase labor costs and total costs,
with undesirable results, such as unemployment and repressed enterprise.
Without question some unions secure unjustified differentials. I will not
mention plumbers, for you have heard of them. Unionism may result in an
uneconomic distribution and use of a nation's productive capacity. But without
control through collective bargaining or through law, sweated wages
and sweated industries are not highly exceptional. They are uneconomic.
Think of coal in the nineties, of the needle trades, of the laundries and of
the candy factories. It is likely that collective bargaining has more frequently
brought wages in an industry up to an acceptable level than it has


### ---Economics-1935-0-08.txt---
resulted in unjustified differentials. Moreover, in many cases high wages
for some groups have been sacrificed in order to increase the wages of the
lowly paid groups. In any event, the fact of unjustified differentials does
not necessarily argue against collective bargaining. It argues rather for the
industrial union so that craft wages will not be out of line with wages of
the unskilled, and for government action to provide needed data and
efficient conciliation and arbitration machinery.
I pass to the incidence of wage increases exacted. As to the effects of
increased wages, economists, as well as business men, when confronted by
demands for higher union wages, all too frequently assume that both labor
costs and total costs are increased by the amount the rate of pay is increased.
The fact is that other things do not necessarily remain equal; we are entirely
too much inclined to assume that they do. In a dynamic situation, there is
no necessary and inevitable relationship between a change in wage rates,
especially on a time basis, and labor cost, and there is no necessary and inevitable
relationship between a changed labor cost and total cost. For what
would be an increased cost due to higher wages may, like some taxes, be
transformed or offset in some way or other.
A wage increase may lead the employer to select and train his workers
more carefully. More important, when the union comes in, the turnover
of labor is generally reduced to a fraction of what it has been; the cost of
acquiring new workers and training them, and the losses from interrupted
operation due to unbalanced sections are reduced. Generally the cost of
supervision is also reduced in the union shop. Again, the union may cooperate
in introducing or extending piece work where all previous attempts
have failed. In a Chicago instance, in spite of the dilution of labor made
during a labor shortage in 1919, a clothing firm found that after piece
work had been introduced with the active co6peration of the union, the
output of suits and overcoats per worker in a given unit of time increased
60 per cent. This instance is not unique in my experience. Finally, in cases
of union-management cobperation-which is by no means limited to well
known railway shops-exceptional gains in efficiency and economies may
result. Not infrequently the higher wages are earned, if labor cost is the
test.

On the other hand, it must be admitted that the union shop may be
accompanied by enhanced labor costs exceeding any increase in wage rates
secured. Possibly management loses adequate control over hiring, lay-off
and discharge; for hiring may be controlled by the union and discharge may
be for "cause" only, thus making it difficult to weed out the less desirable.
More frequently than they cooperate in the extension of piece work, unions
oppose it; seldom are bonus systems tolerated in the organized trades. The
union may have bad morale, due to defeat in some objectives, or to a militant


### ---Economics-1935-0-09.txt---
attitude accompanying a strong feeling of solidarity. Limitations may
be placed directly or indirectly upon individual output. In the union shop
helpers may be forced out, the number of apprentices limited, and restrictions
placed upon the subdivision of work or upon the introduction of new
machinery and of more economical processes.
Thus the differences between union and non-union shops and also between
one unionized shop and another are such as to make any conclusions
as to labor costs based upon a comparison of wage rates quite insecure. Concrete
situations differ widely. In one extreme case as a result of union cooperation
in introducing piece work, reducing the turnover of labor, and maintaining
discipline, the wage advances were more than offset and the labor
cost of manufacturing a suit of clothes reduced approximately ten per cent,
though the earnings of the workers more than doubled. In other known
cases the labor cost increased more than would be indicated by the increases
in wages and reductions in hours. But most frequently an increase
in wages on a time basis and almost always an increase in wages on a piece
basis means an increase in labor cost. Such must be the conclusion of the
student whose investigations of concrete cases are of necessity limited to
the short run. Perhaps the long-run effects might differ somewhat because
of the favorable effect of higher wages on efficiency.
Turning to the question of total cost, it may be that with labor made
more expensive, less of it and more of capital will be employed, total costs
not being increased as much as the labor costs would have been. In this
case the amount of employment in the industry is reduced. Higher wages
are then at the expense of employment. On the other hand, with low wages
eliminated, management may be "tightened up." If it is not, a firm may
go to the wall and production be concentrated in the more efficient plants.
But the mortality of firms with unionization is not so great as one might
expect, for in the real world necessity is frequently the mother of invention.
Most economists see only the lure of profit; necessity of remaining in and
playing the game is important. Low wages and long hours often have been
a tax, higher wages and shorter hours a premium, upon efficiency of organization
and management.

Thus only the most intensive investigation would establish the relation
between wages increased by union pressure and labor cost and total cost of
production or of providing a service. And certainly such investigation would
yield diverse results. Nevertheless, it is true that unionization most frequently
means some increase in labor costs and in total costs as well, and sometimes
the increase is a relatively large one.
When and where this is true, the question arises, who loses what organized
labor gains in wages and working conditions? Do higher costs spell
higher prices paid by consumers of the product, whether they be rich or


### ---Economics-1935-0-10.txt---
poor; or do higher wages come out of profits? In either event, and especially
in the second, what is the effect on business enterprise and the volume
of employment for union men?
The answers must be brief and rather inadequate. The all too common
assertion that higher wages resulting in higher costs are charged up to the
consumer is frequently wrong, at least in part. Often they come out of profit,
especially where only a part of the industry is organized. Where they do
come out of profit, industry at that point is handicapped and there is a tendency
for it to migrate and flourish elsewhere. Where higher prices curtail
consumption, as of good housing, or where higher costs come out of profits,
the volume of employment for union men is diminished. Moreover, relatively
high wages may cause unneeded labor to seek to enter or to remain in the
trade, so that the amount of time lost is increased. And where a union cannot
control the industry supplying a market, a struggle ensues and organization
is likely to be disrupted. It is important for unions, especially those not
functioning in a monopolistic or sheltered position, to stress efficiency and
to observe the rule of what the traffic will bear in respect of costs.
Turning to a question which greatly concerned English economists a
century ago, are not the gains of the organized workers inevitably at the
expense of the unorganized?
Analysis shows that the effect of the union higher wages upon the wages
of others is a mixed one. For contrary forces are set in action. In so far as
non-union men are admitted to organized plants, they commonly reap the
full benefit of any improvement secured by union effort. Moreover, the
workers in a non-union plant in an industry with an active unionism also
secure gains; for if their employers pay too low wages and maintain too long
hours, the path of the organizers is easy.
But, on the other hand, where the closed shop is maintained the non-union
workman is excluded, and under the preferential shop he is handicapped.
Or if the effect of unionism is to restrict an industry because of smaller
quantities sold at higher prices or because of curtailment of profits, again
workmen are excluded and forced in increased numbers into other trades.
This of course tends to depress their wages and to increase the differentials
between union and non-union wages.
In these days much is said and a lot assumed about changing the distribution
of income as between labor and other recipients through the extension
of unionism and collective bargaining. A difficult question is raised.
Time permits only a recording of certain views in summary fashion.
It is clear that by the enforcement of standards under collective bargaining
a degree of exploitation can be prevented at the expense of unearned
profit. It is clear, also, that a share can be exacted from monopoly profit,
though, in justice to all, monopoly profit should be taxed away when not
prevented. Pressure exercised by labor or by law can have the effect of


### ---Economics-1935-0-11.txt---
reducing salaries. These are all too frequently "fancy" and therefore socially
and economically unwarranted. Yet the total of excessive salary payments
does not bulk large; salaries do not contain much that can be transferred to
labor under the existing industrial system.6 And there are difficulties involved
in transferring directly much from the returns of property and enterprise.


Perhaps about the usual supply of enterprise and capital might be forthcoming
were their returns substantially reduced; for the return required
depends largely upon what can be had. It is certainly no fixed and irreducible
thing. But with mobility of capital, returns in a given country are not independent
of possible returns in other countries. Morever, when labor becomes
dearer and capital cheaper, the latter will be substituted in a measure,
and to that extent capital's return will tend to increase, and likewise technological
unemployment. Finally, capital, if fearful of union control, may
require prospect of more than the usual return as a condition of necessary
supply.

In my opinion the possibility of raising wages generally and substantially
through collective bargaining unless there is increased efficiency and less
waste, is rather limited, however extensive and powerful unionism becomes.
The level of wages and the welfare of the masses turn much more
upon progress in production and upon the taxation and spending policies
of government than upon any such thing as the control of wages through
collective bargaining or through law. Unions should look to results in
production as one road to general welfare. Certainly government revenue
systems and expenditures might be more extensively employed than they
have been to increase the real income of the masses.
Brief reference may be made to the doctrine that wages must be made
high and kept high to provide the mass purchasing power required to maintain
a market outlet for goods produced. This doctrine lies behind much
of American union, and now of public, policy. It is the subject of much
current discussion.

The doctrine of high wages is open to criticism because it makes too
much of the idea of a limited market. Very frequently there is failure to
realize that the whole value of what is produced is distributed to labor,
management and the owners of property employed-that each dollar,
whether obtained as wages, interest or profit, has potential buying power.
The doctrine does, however, contain a large kernel of significant fact. The
rate of saving and investment, the amount of speculation and room for
error in forecasting the market, vary with the distribution of the industrial


### ---Economics-1935-0-12.txt---
product. Other things equal, the smaller the share going in wages, the
more rapid is saving and investment and the greater the risk of industrial
miscarriage. Beyond this, opportunity for investment is limited by the
possibilities of consumption. Investments must be supported by capacity to
buy and consume. And, it may be added, it is difficult to see what significance
industrial progress has unless it adds in large measure to the welfare
of the masses of the people. Labor's general doctrine of "progressing" wages
cannot be dismissed.
What should be done about wages in time of depression? Business men
who pay wages, and economists, have been dominated by the belief that
wage rates must be reduced in depression in order that the employer, with
lower labor costs, may successfully compete, and that necessary profit may
be realized, investment induced and business enterprise revived. Organized
labor in the present depression has held that wage rates should be increased
so that consuming power may be expanded and an adequate market provided.
It is no secret that this position has colored the New Deal.
In so far as this concerns recovery as against reconstruction, the position
taken by organized labor must be regarded as a mistaken one when applied
in private industry motivated by prospect of profit. As seen by those who
for profit pay wages, costs are too high because wages are too high; higher
wages cause fewer to be hired; purchasing power may be smaller when
wage rates are high than when they are low.
Economists rather generally believe that in normal and especially in
boom times good policy calls for progressing wage rates, which the traffic
can and should bear, but that in depression wage maintenance or enhancement
is at the expense of recovery and volume of employment. They do not
believe in inelastic or in increased wages in depression. In their view, wage
brakes should be applied in booms, but should be released in depression.
High wages do not serve as a self-starter.
With this I agree, when recovery rather than reform is the objective. My
differences with some of the fraternity have to do with important phases
often regarded as minor points. Frequently, it seems to me, wage reduction
is entirely too much emphasized as a means of recovery. It is unfortunate
that there is limited recognition of the fact that reductions in non-labor
costs and fixed charges are just as important for lowering total costs and
restoring profit. There is a great problem of sticky prices of many things,
especially of building materials and of goods entering into capital equipment.
This problem has increased under the New Deal. There is also
a problem of heavy fixed charges due to unwarranted emphasis upon mortgage
bonds in corporation finance. The bondholder is insured as against
everyone else. My second point is that good policy rejects wage cuts until
waste and other elements in costs have been removed or deflated. Efficiency,


### ---Economics-1935-0-13.txt---
general welfare and maintenance of the market for the bulk of consumption
goods, all require this.
Whether I have successfully sustained it or not, my position is that there
is a case for collective dealing, though it offers no panacea. The problem is
to secure the advantages of standardization and the needed pressure toward
efficiency and elimination of waste, and at the same time to establish such
relations between industries as will give an economical industrial structure
and relatively fair employment conditions. But why should this not be
worked out through codes of fair competition or through some less direct
form of government intervention?
This question I cannot discuss save in one of its aspects. Frequently it is
said that code making and enforcement render or should render organization
of labor unnecessary. Experience has shown this to be untrue. What a
code contains depends very much upon whether labor is effectively organized
and articulate. Code administration depends almost as much upon the
same thing. Pressure group must be balanced by pressure group under democratic
government.

A final word. Unionism means a new government in industry. Any government
is what that government does with its problems. Employers should
accept the principle of collective bargaining in good faith. Labor organizations
must be alive to their responsibilities to industry and to the consuming
public as well as to their members. While militant on occasion, they must
be cobperative in production. There should be a reasonable correspondence
between wages in different industries if a sound economy is to be realized.
Perhaps all this is too much to expect from pressure groups, with or without
collective bargaining. Government must step in; it has and will remain.
Government should provide the indispensable chilled steel tools-that is,
unquestionable data on wages, hours, turnover, costs, etc.-and adequate
machinery for conciliation, mediation and voluntary arbitration, to smooth
the way for joint dealing to the end that the unsocial powerful may be
held in check and that reason may be permitted to prevail. Given reason
and good faith, out of this welter of collective bargaining there may possibly
emerge desirable social habits in industry.

This is a time for reviewing fifty years of accomplishment in our science;
and much accomplishment there has been, in which we may well take pride.
But while this is fitting and proper, we shall not do well to dwell too much
on the mood of self-congratulation. For this is also a time for rather deep
humility and searching examination of our results, our methods and our
standards. We know much more than we did fifty years ago, bht in another
sense there is much less of which we are certain. And it remains true that in
a time of desperate need economics has not furnished the unified and authoritative
guidance which many have thought, rightly or wrongly, that they
had a right to expect. The story I must try to tell is an unfinished one, and
there is no guarantee of a happy ending.
A Review of Fifty Years: The Starting-Point
"Speaking generally, . . . the men best qualified to stand in the front rank
of American Economists are not the authors of systems or general theories, or


### ---Economics-1936-0-02.txt---
textbooks of principles, but writers on special subjects.... The number
of powerful intellects it has brought to bear on them is a remarkable phenomenon.
... In the perfection of its economic statistics America leaves England
behind." This was not written in 1935, but in 1880, by Cliffe Leslie;
and the men he names as writers on special subjects include David A. Wells,
Francis A. Walker, William G. Sumner, C. F. Dunbar and Simon Newcomb.
A few years later, Walker and Newcomb joined the ranks of the authors of
general treatises; and later still, the tone of the picture changed radically.
The great revival and expansion of American economics dates, not from
the founding of the American Economic Association, but from the end of
the Civil War. The founding of the Association marks, however, a profound
reorientation of the utmost importance. To understand it, one must
go back to the state of college teaching of economics half a generation
previous. The subject was typically treated as an adjunct to philosophy; and
simple and absolute "natural laws" were presented as final truths about the
economic world. Out of this schooling came a small group of young and
able students, independent enough to react against it, conscious of defects
of traditional method and shortcomings of traditional doctrine, and ambitious
to build a better structure on sounder foundations. They went to
Germany for advanced study; and we now delight to honor them as the
Pilgrim Fathers of the new movement.
The period of over sixty years which followed may be roughly marked
off into four main movements, coming into dominance at successive periods
of time, but over-lapping one another as all such movements in history
are bound to do. First came a period of preparation, orientation and gestation,
lasting until approximately 1890, and including the formation of the
Economic Association. Second came the development and consolidation of
an indigenous form of the marginal economics, paralleling the development
of the Austrian economics and of Alfred Marshall's economics in
England. Third came a critical movement; and fourth, the rise to dominance
of positive types of study of diverse sorts, among which our efforts are
divided-shall I say dispersed?-at the present time.
Preparation, Orientation, Gestation
The process of orientation contained much that was superficially paradoxical.
It was part of a transition of which one might flippantly say that
it gradually transformed American economists from laissez faire protectionists
to free-traders who believed strongly in the positive function of the
State in economic life. This paradox, however, is easily explained by the
changing issues of the times. More seriously one might ponder over a
movement, largely animated by a spirit of breaking away from traditional
system theories and apparently well launched in the direction of the Historical
School, yet the outstanding fruit of which in its first twenty years


### ---Economics-1936-0-03.txt---
and more was a most luxuriant crop of system theories of a new sort. If
there was one thing that American economics did not do during that period,
it was to become dominantly historical.
To explain this fact it may be sufficient to recall that these Pilgrim
Fathers were individuals, independent-minded, differing from one another,
and no more prepared to accept uncritically the more extreme forms of
German doctrines than those of their own country. They brought back
with them a social type of ethical background, but not a particularistic
type of nationalism. Their conception of the increased role of the State
was at the service of this social ethics, not of narrow nationalistic ends.
They genuinely wished a broader groundwork of historical fact to put
system theory on a proper basis, but not to displace it entirely. On the whole,
they were, and remained, more nearly in the current of the English tradition
than in that of Germany.
While the younger members of the group were laying their foundations,
the commanding figure of Francis A. Walker dominated the field; his
Political Economy, appearing in 1883, took rank as the outstanding American
treatise, and bridged the interval between the earlier classical period
and the later marginalism. Soon after, the younger group began to put
forth their works. As might be expected, there were many special studies;
but far more revealing were a few that expressed the writers' general points
of view-my father's Philosophy of Wealth, Patten's Premises of Political
Economy and his Consumption of Wealth, and Henry C. Adams's classic
monograph on The State in Relation to Industrial Action. Here was an
unmistakable reorientation, neither classical nor purely historical. By the
end of the eighties, Ely's Introduction to Political Economy had appeared;
and two papers by my father and one by Stuart Wood had staked out the
marginal productivity theory of distribution. The phase of preparation was
at an end.

Systematic Marginal Economics
Of the various forms of systematic marginal economics which had their
independent origin in this country, there is little I can profitably attempt
to say in the time available, save that they caused this country to take rank
with the leading foreign countries in the development of theoretical economics
which was directed to analyzing the conditions of a stable or a
static equilibrium. The few comments I shall make are not so much on the
marginal economics as on our attitude toward it.
One is that the marginal or differential method is and remains perhaps
the greatest single tool of economic analysis; and its usefulness is by no
means confined to the study of the simple conditions of perfect and stable
equilibrium. Another is that these studies of equilibrium are not endproducts,
and not to be construed as finished pictures of the actual world;
in my father's case at least great care was taken not to present them as


### ---Economics-1936-0-04.txt---
such. They are themselves tools of analysis and methods of approach to a
picture too complicated ever to be finished. A third point is that while a
picture of perfect equilibrium deals in its way with forces which are at
work in the actual world, the form in which it presents these forces will
almost inevitably need to be modified when we move on to the task of
studying them as they actually operate. The terms of a static demand schedule
need to be changed in order to fashion it into a verifiable concept;
and the tendency of prices toward cost of production does not operate
unqualifiedly under all conditions. Some of these changes are likely to be
of the sort which John Stuart Mill described as chemical rather than mechanical,
leading to results not deducible by the method of composition of
forces. And a fourth point is that the problems with which these theories
of marginal equilibrium deal are not the whole of economics.
In the period when the economics of marginal equilibrium held the
field as the supreme orthodoxy, these qualifications tended to be forgotten
to a greater or less extent; and the result was really an injustice to the
theory. Too much was expected of it.
The Critical Movement
At no time was the marginal economics free from disagreement and
controversy; in fact, some of its family quarrels were famous. More serious
criticism began to come from Thorstein Veblen even before the publication
of my father's Distribution of Wealth; but for some time he made
little impression on those inside the citadel, save one of irritated puzzlement
as to what he was driving at and why. But for some years before the
outbreak of the World War there was an increasing spirit of scepticism
mixed with active iconoclasm, which before long came to seem the characteristic
mood.

There were attacks on the hedonistic psychology underlying marginal
utility, leading some to withdraw into psychological agnosticism. Some
managed miraculously to keep a semblance of the doctrine while attempting
to withdraw from all vulnerable psychological positions. There were attacks
on the ethical implications of marginal productivity, attacks on the logic of
marginal imputation and on the founding of the factors which underlay
it. There were attacks on statics for not being dynamics, or more pertinently
for not affording an adequate approach to dynamics. There were attacks
going no deeper than verbal questions of the formulation of theories, and
attacks apparently aiming to uproot all theory as such. In caliber, the attacks
ranged from mediocrity cavilling at what it did not understand to genius
declining to classify its intuitive insights in the customary pigeonholes.
It is obviously out of the question to estimate the validity of all this
body of criticism. Instead, I shall content myself with suggesting the way
in which it seems probable that this question will work itself out-namely,


### ---Economics-1936-0-05.txt---
in the theories and assumptions which the oncoming generation will find
useful and necessary in the positive work which it will do. Judging by
present indications, the effect in the long run will not be one of complete
destruction.

Modern inductive and quantitative studies are already making use of
bits of the equilibrium theory as hypotheses, although they have usually
had to be reformulated to adapt them to the requirements of verification.
Even in the study of disturbances themselves, pictures of the conditions
necessary to equilibrium often furnish a starting-point in the analysis of
why equilibrium is not reached. This method has its dangers; for the investigator
is prone to rest content when he has found one cause which
seems sufficient to explain the general fact of disturbance, and emerges
with a one-sided and inadequate theory. Such reasoning should be based
on an adequate factual picture; but the factual picture alone is not sufficient.


An interesting case is afforded by the question whether statistical studies
reveal evidence of a tendency of price toward "normal." Construing this
for the moment in the limited sense of a normal relation of price to expense
of production, the figures show a tendency of price to fluctuate
around some kind of typical or average relation to cost, and in this sense
a normal price persists. What the figures do not show is a separate force
tending to cause prices to return to this normal relation to costs whenever
they have departed from it in the smallest degree, beginning to act as
soon as any discrepancy shows itself, continuing until prices have returned
to normal, and then ceasing. This latter concept of the tendency to normal,
which is appropriate to a static state, is too simple to represent the forces
acting under dynamic conditions. Instead, it seems probable that the selflimiting
and the cumulative forces are not neatly separated from each
other, but may represent the same forces or factors acting differently under
different conditions.
Another aspect of the static normal is the tendency to full utilization
of the productive factors. It is obvious that actual conditions cannot fluctuate
around this as an average, since they can depart from it in only one
direction. Hence the typical or average condition is necessarily below the
static norm; and a "normal" percentage of utilization derived from the
average of observed behavior is necessarily a dynamic factor and not anything
pertinent to a static state of perfect and stable equilibrium.
When equilibrium theories are used as devices to analyze actual conditions
which do not follow the equilibrium model, one curious and interesting
result sometimes follows-namely, a fuller development of the equilibrium
theory itself. The conditions necessary to equilibrium often have
to be more carefully and rigorously stated than ever before, in order to
show how actual conditions differ and why they lead to a different result.


### ---Economics-1936-0-06.txt---
In this way the theory of imperfect competition has forced economists to
pay serious and searching attention to the definition of the conditions necessary
to perfect competition-something which had previously been strangely
neglected. The same principle applies to the theory of marginal productivity,
in whose mathematical implications some renewed interest has
lately been shown by mathematico-quantitative investigators. One may anticipate
a considerable development and refinement of this theory in following
out the different ways and degrees in which the underlying principle
applies to different kinds of concrete situations.
Negative criticism did not drive out "orthodoxy" from the field of
theory, partly because nature abhors a vacuum-if such a pre-scientific
expression may be indulged in. What happened during this period was
that other fields of study expanded enormously and drew more and more
apart from the central core of theory. These special fields involved much
factual study and had their own special histories, and were constantly
dealing with problems of expanding governmental action. In this way
American economics was approaching more closely to the character announced
in the early manifesto of the Economic Association. With the
entry of this country into the World War, interest in negative theoretical
criticism was overshadowed by more urgent positive needs.
Positive Inquiry of Diverse Types
With this change in emphasis, the foreground came to be occupied by
various types of positive studies, some of which were already well under
way. First, and perhaps most characteristic, was the quantitative analysis
of economic behavior, with its chief interest centered on the problem of
economic fluctuations.
This branch of study had previously been regarded as hardly respectable
for a scientific economist to take seriously, owing largely to three handicaps.
One was the lack of adequate statistical material. This left the study
of booms and depressions in the realm of speculative theories, and the
assumptions underlying them necessarily ran counter to the preconceptions
of the dominant equilibrium theory, and hence were worse than suspect
as being unscientific. Worst of all, these theories were associated with
socialistic doctrines which were beyond the pale. The first handicap has
been overcome by the development of statistics. If the problem is not solved,
there is now at least plenty of material to set one's teeth into. The other
obstacles have been worn away by a sort of attrition, aided by the waning
of the prestige of equilibrium theory and the decline of the general spirit
of optimistic faith in the spontaneous workings of the competitive system
which characterized the nineteenth century. But the most active element
has probably been the growing seriousness of the problem itself, which
could not forever be dismissed by a defense reaction based mainly on the


### ---Economics-1936-0-07.txt---
classical proof of the impossibility of general overproduction.
The appearance of Mitchell's first volume on business cycles in 1913
marks a new epoch in this field of study, replacing abstract speculation by
a detailed quantitative investigation of the phenomenon itself. And now,
after a lapse of twenty years, this problem has at last suddenly forced its
way into the front rank of issues of public policy, and thereby has marked
a new epoch in the relation of government to business.
Along with this development went the growth of the rather elusive
movement known as "Institutionalism," which means so many different
things to so many different people that doubt has arisen whether it has
any definable meaning at all. It covers certain fields of study, such as Veblen'
s evolutionary theories and the investigations of legal institutions by
Ely and Commons. But it may be more important as an underlying point
of view orienting many different kinds of specific studies and lending
changed significance to the day-to-day routine operations of the business
system. It may be that we cannot fully understand these day-to-day operations
without understanding them as parts of an evolutionary movement
going back before the present forms of property rights and containing
forces destined to make the present forms obsolete. This is something
vastly different from the nineteenth century conception of progress within
an institutional framework which was expected to remain fixed because
it had found its final terminus in the system of individualism and free
contract, modified only by piecemeal control of specific abuses.
Another major development of late years is that of mathematical economics,
using new and powerful techniques and bringing its results in touch
with quantitative verification. The recent founding of the Econometric
Society is a landmark in this movement. It faces great and inherent difficulties
in the framing of assumptions simple enough to lend themselves
to mathematical formulas yet flexible enough to grapple effectively with
the problems of dynamic economics. Even the measurement of a demand
schedule for a manufactured product is a surprisingly baffling problem.
In the face of these difficulties, important achievements have been made,
and more are to be looked for in the future.
Much has been done lately by mathematical and quantitative methods
with the theory of general price levels and their changes. Here the most
notable recent contributions have come from the other side of the water;
but all appear to be in a decidedly controversial stage at present. Another
subject recently attacked by mathematical methods, both here and in England,
is imperfect competition. The results so far are of great interest;
but they illustrate the difficulty already mentioned, of framing usable
assumptions adequate to interpreting the complexities of actual conditions.
The time element in demand and supply schedules is particularly baffling,
while the relation between these abstract curves and the mental processes


### ---Economics-1936-0-08.txt---
governing the actual reactions of business men bids fair to defy systematic
analysis. We shall probably be wrestling with these difficulties for some
time to come.

The fact is that as we enter the realm of dynamic and quantitative problems,
we face more and more exacting demands. The certainties of equilibrium
theory, hypothetical though they were, are replaced by stubborn uncertainties;
and the most careful students are the least ready to present
final answers. The mills of quantitative research grind slowly, and may
never produce certainties on many of the larger issues. Hence, the humility
which the responsible student must needs feel, even after footing up a
large total of achievement by his science of economics during the past
fifty years.

Equilibrium theory assumed that what is saved is spent; that purchasing
power arising from production is used and flows back into further production.
Now we ask if this is true, and find evidence of discrepancies. If we
spend more for some one thing, shall we have less left to spend on other
things, or more? The answer begins with: "It depends." Are imports an
addition to our national dividend and exports a subtraction, or vice versa?
We have no ready-made answer. We cannot combat old heresies with the
same whole-hearted confidence as our predecessors-there may be something
in them. And in this mood of doubtful potency we entered the gravest
crisis of economic policy which this country has faced since the slavery
question.

Economics and the World Crisis
If we try to assess the part economists have played in this crisis, the
result is likely to be confusing. If our criterion is the part they have played
in shaping policy, we find that a few economists have played a strategic
part, while many more have rendered able and conscientious service in
subordinate positions, below the levels at which policies were formed. If
we ask instead whether economists have been able to reach substantial
agreement on proposed measures, we find that there has been a considerable
measure of agreement, though far short of unanimity; but this agreement
has quite commonly been contrary to the policies actually followed.
The greatest approach to unanimity probably came in the condemnation of
a high tariff. This was a standard reaction on the part of the economists;
and the politicians countered with their own standard reaction-by ignoring
it.

The unfortunate fact seems to be that the consensus of economists has
no absolute authority, and no right to claim it. Scientific truth is not to be
certified by a general counting of noses, even the noses of economists.
The results of new and untried measures can seldom if ever be predicted
with scientific certainty. Within the margin of doubt, economists, like
others, will follow their preconceptions; the minority view may happen


### ---Economics-1936-0-09.txt---
to be right; and the government will be free to select those theories and
proposals which best fit the tone of the administrative mind.
This difficulty will probably always be with us. In the face of it, what
is the best we can do? Few would nowadays attempt to draw solutions
ready-made from traditional theories. I can think of instances which approximate
this, but they are rare. And the economist who does this is hardly
less risky a guide than the one who follows the more popular course,
throwing all received theories overboard and trying to work out every problem
as a fresh and disconnected exercise. What is needed is a readiness
to use accepted theories, and the methods by which they were derived,
as tools of analysis, with a clear eye for the limitations of their applicability
to the specific conditions of the problem in hand, and a readiness to make
the theories over, if need be, on a basis of changed assumptions. In short,
what is needed is thinking which is free, but disciplined. A few of us are
like soldiers going through the manual of arms in the face of the enemy;
more of us are throwing away our guns because we see no use in the
manual. Neither of these is the way to win battles.
I have already said that this present crisis marks an epoch in the relation
of government to business. Earlier controls dealt with localized sections
of industry, applying standards derived from the unregulated field; or
they dealt with particular incidental aspects other than the central question
what and how much to produce and at what price. Now we are dealing
with inidustry as a whole and going to the core of the matter. Earlier controls
dealt mainly in restraints on particular abuses; the present problem
is not one of restraints on abuses of vigorous private activities, but one of
supplying motive force itself where motive force is lacking. Earlier attacks
left unquestioned the main redeeming feature of private industry its
power to produce goods plentifully and efficiently; now this main redeeming
feature is called in question. And apparently few leaders of private
industry yet realize the seriousness of the situation.
The issue seems to be wrongly put by many, who ask whether in the
face of the weakness of private industry and our fumbling attempts to
deal with it, the present system of private industry can be maintained. The
answer seems clear. If the system persists, its character will be changed
until it will no longer be the present system. If change does not come
through governmental action, it will come through inevitable developments
in industry itself. The system has been changing its character constantly
during the last hundred and fifty years, and as much through the action
of industry as that of government. More changes are in store; and we can
set no ultimate limit on their extent.
The present system is failing to use the productive powers it has so
plentifully developed, and to give everyone an opportunity to produce and
to earn a living. Can a system which will do these things be fashioned


### ---Economics-1936-0-10.txt---
out of the present system by methods which will preserve the continuity
of our development; or will a violent break be unavoidable? This seems
to be the real question; and the world will not give us unlimited time to
work out the answer.
Those who, like myself, have been brought up in the liberal tradition of
gradual change, will approach this question with a strong leaning-call
it a prejudice if you will in favor of evolutionary rather than revolutionary
methods of change, urging that the former be given the benefit of every
reasonable doubt. Personally, I hope most earnestly that evolutionary methods
will prove sufficient; but I recognize that this is hope, not prophecy.
To make it come true will be one of the most difficult things a nation ever
undertook; but it is not yet proved impossible.
If this is a true estimate of the probabilities, it places the future work
of the economist in a very different setting from the atmosphere of relative
stability and certainty in which our predecessors operated. It points to the
likelihood of a world full of trial-and-error experimentation, in which the
more deliberate studies may seem fated to reach their goal, if at all, too
late to render service. That chance some of us must take, while others grapple
with the more immediate issues.
Problems for Economists
As to the technical problems facing us as economists, many have been
dealt with at these meetings, and I shall mention only three groups by
way of illustration.
In the field of economics of wage levels, what is the character of the
demand schedule for labor under different conditions? What are the effects
of wage changes on the threefold function of wages (a) as incentive
to the worker, (b) as cost of production to the employer, and (c) as purchasing
power furnishing demand for goods? Are the requirements of
these three functions in harmony, or if not, can they be brought into
harmony?

In the theoretical field, there is a whole class of questions arising where
a given economic change may have either self-limiting or cumulative
effects or both, the question being to distinguish the fields within which
these two opposite effects occur-in short, to give us a better systematized
basis for judging which kind of effect to expect in any given case. For
example, under what conditions, or over what periods of time, will spending
more for radios leave the country less to spend on other things, and
under what conditions will it leave more? Under what conditions are
imports a loss to our national economy and under what conditions are they
a gain?

Another large class of theoretical questions has to do with introducing
t1me elements which have not yet been introduced into familiar concepts.


### ---Economics-1936-0-11.txt---
Take, for example, a demand schedule. Will a given change in the price
of electric refrigerators, relative to other things, have different effects in
a day, a month, a year, five years? Would other commodities show substantially
the full effect more quickly or more slowly? Can this time
element be represented by a curve approaching a saturation-point in time,
or by some other type of curve? Will sales at a price of $100 be different
one week after a reduction from $120 from what they would be one week
after an increase from $80? This problem seems especially pertinent to
the concept of the demand schedule for the output of a single productive
enterprise, of which so much use is now being made in the theory of imperfect
competition.

The list of problems is endless; but these examples may suffice. It is
clear that there is no lack of tasks for economists, and tasks which have
important bearings on policy, aside from catch-as-catch-can wrestling with
the expediencies of particular proposed measures.
Conclusion

It is not certain how much time the world will give us for finding answers
to questions such as these; indeed, it is not certain that free scientific
inquiry itself has a perpetual undisturbed lease on life. These also are
chances we must take. It may not be wise to embark on inquiries which
presuppose that the present system will remain substantially unchanged for
generations to come. But it is still less wise to be stampeded by the critical
state of the world into abandonment of all systematic inquiry; of all definitely
scientific researches which do not bear on the instant solution of the
question of a processing tax or a coal-control bill. And back of these researches
lies the thing which makes them possible: free scientific inquiry.
This, rather than particular conclusions and doctrines, is the most precious
heritage left us by our honored predecessors. It still has its place in the
world, so long as the world will tolerate it; and of all our possessions as
economists, this is the one best worth conserving, and defending if the
need should arise, with every effort in our power.

Economic science has a solid tradition and an arsenal of techniques that
offer a fair measure of objective certainty. As economists we think of our
science developing out of its own inner forces, according to its own laws.
Why then need we concern ourselves particularly with the fact that the social
political economic intellectual world is obviously in a condition of flux
which as historians we should have to recognize as presaging a transition
to a new order?

Is it relevant that the layman expects us to direct our interests and efforts
toward the problems that are presented by the time? We all know, indeed,
that the intelligent public is discontented with the economists. We are
charged with a multitude of sins, many of which we do cheerfully and
sinfully acknowledge. We are said to disagree on every imaginable point
of doctrine. So we do. We are freemen. Those who wish for agreement
among scholars would best turn to the scholars functioning anemically under
the totalitarian states, where economics is an apology for the will of a
dictator, usually an ordinary man of low I.Q., magnified to a million
diameters. We plead guilty to the charge of diversity of opinion. We are
proud to plead guilty.
But there is another charge brought against us for which our defense is
not so adequate. It is the charge that we spend too much time in ivory towers
-vegetable ivory, to be sure, made by du Pont-and too little time out in
the rough and tumble of real life. We are credited with the ability to apply
reason to the problems that are breaking the back of the average good
citizen, but we appear to lack the public spirit that would prompt -us to
exercise that ability.
Imagine that we were living in a time of geologic cataclysm, and the
vast Eurasian continent, from Kamchatka to Gibraltar were cleft in twain,
exposing the geologic formations down to the hot Plutonic base, what
could we expect of the geologists? That they would add footnotes and
appendices to their standard texts, or that they would go out with hammer
and chisel, and report: "Such and such is the actual architecture of the


### ---Economics-1937-0-02.txt---
world"? Later they might find it interesting to note that the great minds
of the past had an occasional inkling of the reality.
The economic and social world was cleft and shattered by the series
of events beginning in 1914. How confidently can the future historian turn
to the economic writings of the war and post-war periods for an illuminating
analysis of the actual development of economic forces and their social
political repercussions? The layman believes that the historian will find that
the writings of economists offer the least fruitful material for his purposes.
The layman thinks that the economist has been not very helpful in
clearing up the issues raised by the late depression. He thinks that the
economist has followed the time-honored precept: "If you haven't got
what the customer wants, throw a handful of statistics in his eyes."
Of course the layman is uninformed and unfair. It goes without saying
that he greatly under-estimates the actual contribution of the economists
to the interpretation of the problems of the day. In one point, however, the
layman appears to have justice on his side. The economist has not been
active enough, responsible enough, well enough organized, to bring forward
his findings on emergency situations before the moment for action has
gone by. The economist has refused to pass judgment on the basis of data
that are only ninety per cent adequate, although the practical affairs of
the world must necessarily be conducted on a much less adequate basis
than that. In spite of the fact that his material is always imperfect, he has
allowed himself to be controlled, in too great measure, by academic perfectionism.
In spite of his recognition of the fugitive character of authority in
the social sciences, he is unwilling to take a chance that might weaken his
authority.

Therefore politics, which must act when the crisis presses, acts for the
most part without benefit of the services of the economists. With due
credit to the economists who composed the original "brain trust," we must
still admit that the policies grouped together under the term "New Deal"
have been little influenced by the professional economist. The economists
were slow to realize the need for action, and were inclined to hold back and
let the politicians assume all the responsibility. We saw, in the making,
measures that responded to an immediate need, but were full of imperfections.
We saw other measures that should never have been adopted, but we
held our fire until after the enemy column had passed. This the lay public
resents.

But are we as scientists responsible for applying ourselves to the immediate
need? Is it not the glory of science that it holds aloof from the transient
emergency and discovers principles that have worked through long periods,
and will still be operating after the dust of the present occasion has cleared
away?

It is possible that the physical sciences may develop independently of


### ---Economics-1937-0-03.txt---
urgent present needs. The course of development of the social sciences
exhibits no such independence of the course of actual events. We have
moved from practical problem to practical problem ever since the first
mercantilist writers tried to clarify the rules of foreign trade and the
physiocrats sought release from a system of taxation and regulation that
was destroying the basis of a civilization. Today, too, the greater part of
our economic thinking revolves around the problems of the day. When we
shall have worked through the data of war and post-war adjustment, of
depression and recovery, every part of our system of thought, even to the
most refined theory, will have undergone modification.
The economist cannot justly be criticized as aloof to the issues of the time.
Where he may fairly be criticized lies in the slowness of his response.
There is too long a lag between the questions put to him and the answers
he works out. In a slow moving world like that of the nineteenth century
this perhaps made little difference. In a world undergoing transition the
answers may come too late to be of value.
Collectively the economists of today represent an incomparably greater
mass of trained thinking power than those of an earlier world. The public
holds them responsible, collectively, for applying this power promptly to
the issues of the time, that the inevitable adjustments of a period of transition
may be made without unnecessary friction and waste. But we are not
organized to carry a collective responsibility. We alone are left of the era of
rugged individualism, each staking his own claim and exploiting it or
neglecting it as he pleases.
The time has come when the economists need to organize themselves
effectively to do the work which society may reasonably require of them.
We shall be organized not indeed to replace the work of the individual
scholar by that of associated groups. Most significant work will always be
done by the scholar working as an individual. But we shall make a real
effort to keep our whole personnel alive to the issues of the time. We shall
know what resources we have for dealing with these issues, and we shall
use our organized moral forces to encourage the full employment of these
resources for the general good.

The program of the American Economic Association this year is an
experiment. Aside from the session this afternoon on Marxian economics,
the program is entirely concerned with problems of savings and investment.
The number of formal papers has been reduced to a minimum,
while the number of round-table meetings has been greatly increased. My
own part in the program is perhaps also in the nature of an experiment
since I am going to discuss a problem of immediate practical importance,
the problem of recovery in the United States. During the last four years,
our recovery from the depression has been less complete than in many
other countries, and now we seem to have taken the initiative in receding
from such recovery as has been made. This unsatisfactory experience demands
explanation, particularly in view of the presence of a variety of
influences of a favorable character. The United States has been comparatively
free from the hazard of war. Our domestic market is the largest
free-trade market in the world. Undoubtedly, also, a larger proportion
of the brains and energy of our people are devoted to business activities
than in other countries-at least than in the countries of western Europe.
Why, then, have we found it exceptionally difficult to restore and maintain
anything approaching full use of our available resources of land, labor
and capital?

Every great depression, as contrasted with minor cyclical recessions,
presents a situation in which considerable and difficult shifts in the employment
of labor and capital are required. This was the case in the
seventies of the last century, for example; and now we have been confronted
with the necessity of developing a situation in which there shall
be an increased output of those manufactured goods and services for which
there is an elastic demand-an increase sufficient to absorb all the unemployed
labor attached to industry and also to draw considerable numbers
from agriculture. Only then will the agricultural problem become readily
manageable. Subjected to this test, the recovery which we have made is
not impressive. Industries producing manufactured consumer goods have
indeed made a fair recovery; but that recovery has been supported in part


### ---Economics-1938-0-02.txt---
by the temporary expedient of liberal government expenditure. Agriculture
is doubtless in better position than four years ago, although its
improvement rests upon the unsatisfactory and somewhat unstable foundation
of resisted output. On the other hand, the industries producing capital
goods have shown little sign of complete recovery, and such moderate
recovery as has been made in rather laggard fashion has recently been
reversed. Clearly it is the development of conditions under which there
shall be a large and maintained increase in the demand for the products
of the heavy industries that is required for recovery. Further expansion in
the consumer-goods industries cannot take place upon a solid foundation
unless it is supported by increased employment in the heavy industries.
It is sometimes said in business circles that nothing more than confidence
is required to induce activity in the production of capital goods. This seems
to me a most superficial view since it is at least quite possible, as has happened
at times in recent years, that a mere wave of confidence will result in
the creation of conditions which will speedily check expansion in this direction.
A widespread advance in costs and prices, for example, in the products
of the heavy industries under the favorable influence of a wave of confidence
would not only be likely to check expansion, but would also create additional
obstacles in the way of subsequent improvement. Much the same
observation may be ventured regarding changes in, or the repeal of, the
undistributed profits tax and the capital gains tax. They would seem to
me to be minor obstacles, the removal of which, however desirable, would
in itself be far from sufficient to bring about recovery.
At this point I cannot resist the temptation to mention another obstacle
in the way of recovery that is also doubtless of secondary importance. I
refer to the growing tendency to rely upon forecasts of business conditions
in the determination of business policies. Were an individual to have his
blood pressure and blood count taken at frequent intervals, surely a very
bad psychological effect would result-similarly with business, when attention
is constantly fixed upon the gyrations of security quotations on our
stock exchange, and upon the various indices of business conditions supplied
by numerous statistical agencies and financial soothsayers. This habit,
I am confident, contributes not a little to accentuate business fluctuations.
It leads to a speeding up of production and the accumulation of inventories
of raw and finished goods when the signal is green, and to precipitate
stoppages when a yellow or red light is indicated. Here, also perhaps, is
found some part of the explanation of short-sighted advances in prices
upon the appearance of an incipient increase in demand and the resultant
contraction of output which follows upon its consequent shrinkage.
I shall not dwell further upon these secondary obstacles to investment,
the number of which could readily be still further enlarged. After all,
something more than the removal of obstacles is needed to bring about a


### ---Economics-1938-0-03.txt---
large and continuing expansion of the capital equipment of the country.
Tendencies and conditions exerting a strong positive influence in this
direction must be present. Were they present, I am confident that the
secondary obstacles which I have indicated would be readily surmounted.
For the investment of capital on a large scale, three influences or conditions
would seem to be essential. They are, first, large supplies of capital
available at low rates; second, relatively low prices for the concrete products
on which investment funds are expended; and, third, and of most importance,
reasonable expectations that there will be a satisfactory demand
from consumers for the additional goods and services resulting from the
investment of adcditional capital.
Our experience during the last few years seems clearly to indicate that
the first of these factors, a large supply of investment funds available at
low cost, does not of itself exert a sufficiently potent influence to yield
activity in the production of capital goods. Some decline in the cost of
capital and of bank credit was an inevitable result of slackened demand
incident to the depression; and this declining tendency of rates has been
accentuated by means of the monetary policies which have been adopted.
It is not possible, however, to reduce rates indefinitely for all uses of capital
by monetary action. Here, as elsewhere, there are rigidities in our economic
structure. Easy money can bring about abnormally low rates for short-time
loans of the highest quality. Easy money also exerts a powerful influence
upon quotations of bonds of the highest class, and a somewhat less potent influence
on bonds of inferior quality. Easy money may also induce rising prices
for equities actively dealt in on stock exchanges; but easy money does not,
in any short period of time at least, affect very much the cost of securing
new capital except for corporations in the highest credit. Moreover, in
the United States, owing in part to our decentralized banking system, the
pervasive influence of easy money even in the case of short-time commercial
loans is considerably less than elsewhere.
Finally, it may be observed that the effect of easy money is obstructed
because of the grave doubts entertained by investors as to the persistence
of low rates brought about chiefly by this means. Over a long period of
time, if there is an abundance of savings relative to investment demand,
the expected rate of return on investments will doubtless decline; but
when the decline in rates is induced by a monetary factor, investors are
properly sceptical as to its persistence and are, therefore, unwilling to
purchase any considerable volume of long-term issues yielding a low fixed
rate of return. While easy money then no doubt exerts some influence
tending to reduce rates of interest, it seems clearly quite inadequate of
itself to create a situation in which there shall be an active demand for the
products of the capital-goods industries.
Looking elsewhere for the failure of the capital-goods industries to


### ---Economics-1938-0-04.txt---
expand, I venture to call attention to two obstacles of a very fundamental
character-imperfect competition and the absence of any close relationship
between price and demand in the case of most of the products of these
industries. Such products as steel and cement are not used singly but in
association with other products. Consequently, a reduction in the price of
any one of them is unlikely to induce any appreciable increase in demand.
Only in the event that a reduction is widespread can it be anticipated that
demand will respond to the price stimulus. Under conditions of pure
competition in the various heavy industries a reduction in prices all round
would surely follow slackened demand, and thus help to create a situation
favorable to its subsequent expansion. Consider, for example, the situation
which would probably have developed had production of the various
products of the heavy industries been conducted by many times the present
number of companies. There would have been cutthroat competition with
disastrous consequences to many; but who can doubt that a situation would
have been created which would ultimately have induced an increased
demand?

I would not suggest that it is either desirable or possible to introduce
conditions of pure competition in the various heavy industries of the
country. The problem must be attacked in some other fashion with the
objective in view of securing by more orderly and less disastrous methods
what might be accomplished under a regime of unfettered competition.
Where the number of producers is limited, the range of choice in the
determination of business policies is widened. Planning of some sort takes
the place of the invisible hand of competition. The problem, therefore, is
to discover the kind of planning which will best serve both the interests
of the heavy industries as well as those of the community. I repeat in "the
interests of the heavy industries as well as those of the community," since
quite obviously resort to restrictions on output have been far from profitable
to the industries concerned.
What I have said about the heavy industries would seem to apply with
very little modification to the policies of various groups of organized
workers. The demand for the labor of any one group of skilled workers
is not greatly increased by anything that the group may do in the matter of
wage rates. It is only a general reduction of wage rates of all the groups
of skilled workers that work in association in producing a given product
that can be expected to exert a stimulating influence on demand. A reduction,
for example, of the wage rates of bricklayers will do little to induce
demand unless it is accompanied by a corresponding reduction of wage
rates in all or at least in a large number of the various building trades.
Moreover, even a general reduction in wage rates in the building trades
may be counteracted by an advance in prices of building materials. In


### ---Economics-1938-0-05.txt---
these circumstances it is unreasonable to look for stimulation of business
through an initial reduction in wage scales.
As I look at the matter, both business policies and labor policies during
the last four years have impeded the development of a demand for the
products of the capital-goods industries-policies which, until recently in
all events, have apparently been regarded with unconcern, if not with
favor, by the Government in Washington. It would serve no useful purpose
to attempt to apportion the responsibility attaching to these three
parties in interest. It seems far wiser to attempt to indicate what business,
labor and the Government might reasonably be expected to do in order
to bring about the desired result of an increased demand for capital goods.
It is clearly a situation in which enterprise and risk-taking are required;
and for this reason I venture to think that the initiative should come from
business rather than from labor or the Government.
Until the advent of the current recession, it was perhaps not unreasonable
to anticipate that complete recovery would come of itself. In view of the
expectation of a rapid upward surge of prices of an inflationary character
for which some economists are in part responsible, it is not surprising that
prices were advanced in many lines upon the appearance of a slight increase
in demand, and that no vigorous efforts were made to check a rapid upward
advance in labor costs. Where there is a general eagerness to advance
prices, there is obviously no logical ground for the retention of prevailing
wage scales. It should now be evident, however, that a higher level of
prices through monetary means alone is unlikely to occur in the near future
and almost certain not to be maintained. An upward movement of prices
requires, if it is to be maintained, something approaching steady full
employment of labor. Rising prices are rather a result of activity than a
cause.

Finally, it may be noted that the attitude of the Government has now
become more favorable to an increase in the volume of production through
a reduction in costs and prices where it seems reasonable to anticipate
that an increased demand would thereby be stimulated. In these circumstances
then, it seems that the time is ripe for positive action on the part
of those concerned with the conduct of the capital-goods industries. I do
not suggest that much could certainly be accomplished through price reductions
of particular products, although action on the part of certain
conspicuous factors in the heavy industries might serve to start the ball
rolling; but, given the existing organization of the heavy industries, I
feel certain that concerted action would be far more effective. A general
reduction of prices to the point at which a modest profit would still be
realized as production approached full capacity would seem to me to
provide the basis for a general expansion in demand. Very likely at this


### ---Economics-1938-0-06.txt---
point the specter of the Sherman Anti-Trust law rises in the minds of
many as an insuperable obstacle. I question very much, however, whether
the anti-trust law should be regarded as a serious impediment to this concerted
action in view of the present attitude of the Washington authorities.
After all, concerted action designed to reduce prices and increase demand
is a very different thing from concerted action directed toward maintaining,
to say nothing of establishing, an increase in prices.
Following the adoption of a concerted policy directed toward bringing
about an increase in volume, the industries concerned would be in a far
better position than now to insist upon an increase in efficiency and perhaps
also a reduction in some existing wage scales; but certainly nothing in
this direction can reasonably be expected so long as the policy of the
various industries is precisely that of the less intelligent labor leadersthat
of making adjustments to demand almost exclusively through reduced
output.

I now turn to the question whether there is reasonable ground for
anticipating a large and maintained increase in the demand for the products
of the capital-goods industries in the event that prices were quite materially
reduced. In the case of the familiar uses for additional capital, all of our
past experience indicates that here a little, and there a little, are opportunities
for employing additional capital in improved and enlarged equipment
provided costs are low-both the cost of securing capital and the
cost of the concrete things in the purchase of which the funds are expended.
To increase and improve facilities for the production of greater quantities
of the consumer goods and services which we have been producing in the
past, however, may readily lead to over-development. Moreover, it is not
to be anticipated that there will be any large absorption of capital in some
of the directions where the most considerable investments were made in
the twenties. It is not probable, for example, that lower prices would induce
in the near future any very considerable increase in the construction
of office buildings or high rental apartment houses. In these directions
development was carried unduly far in the twenties and presumably we
have not yet grown up to the existing supply. Even under existing conditions
of costs of materials and labor, there is clearly a sufficiently elastic demand
for electric power to induce a very considerable absorption of capital once
the utility policy of the Government has been determined on a basis reasonably
fair both to the public and to the companies. With lower costs of
construction materials, no doubt still further expansion in this field could
be expected. In the case of the railroads, a large but less considerable
absorption of capital may be anticipated even though the stimulus of an
elastic demand is lacking. Wise railroad investment would seem to be
limited to such expenditure as will definitely reduce costs of operation.
In view of the abundance of savings seeking investment, we cannot,


### ---Economics-1938-0-07.txt---
however, anticipate that the miscellaneous demand for capital together with
that of the utility companies and the railroads will be sufficient to absorb
for an indefinite period all available funds and fully employ the capitalgoods
industries. There is, however, one obvious product for which there
is an elastic demand of vast proportions. I refer, of course, to better
shelter for the mass of people in the United States. Were this provided,
it would further induce a large subsequent demand for appropriate house
furnishings of many kinds. Hitherto efforts to meet this demand have
been limited almost entirely to measures directed toward reducing the
costs of financing and modernizing financial arrangements. They alone
have not proved effective and it mayhap be questioned whether a reduction
in the price of building materials, even if accompanied by some increase
in efficiency in building labor and reduction in building wage rates, would
be sufficient to secure the maximum of improvement in shelter which is
feasible. In addition, we need the creation of business organizations producing
shelter on a large scale, both for sale and for rent. This is essential
because there are many costs involved in the production of shelter in
addition to the costs of materials and labor directly employed and the
financial costs. Business organizations for building and servicing low-cost
houses have not been developed in this country to an extent comparable
to that in many other countries. Because of this lack of organization, we
cannot expect rapid expansion in this field. It does, however, clearly afford
the most promising opportunity for the investment of capital in the future
with a resultant improvement in the standard of living of estimable value.
That an elastic demand for better shelter exists cannot be doubted. To
meet this demand, business organization, as well as low material prices,
efficient labor and adequate finance are needed.

The main papers and the round tables in this year's program, like those
of a year ago, concern a single, though broadly inclusive, subject. A year ago
we considered the various factors which influence fluctuations in the rate of
investment, income and employment. In selecting the topic for this year
we have turned away in large measure from the ever-present and all-absorbing
problem of cyclical fluctuations and have set ourselves the task of
probing the problems of structural change in our economy, involving among
other things also how these structural changes in various countries have
affected the cycle itself. In the main sessions and in the round-table discussions
various aspects of "The Changing American Economy" are considered-
changes in the structure and functioning of our economic institutions.
The topic is, however, so vast that even in a meeting as large as ours
it is quite impossible to include all aspects pertinent to the subject; and
doubtless many members will feel that important segments of the problem
have been overlooked by our program committee.
One may ask: "Is there any special reason why in the year 1938 we
should devote our attention as economists to the general subject "The
Changing Character of the American Economy"? Throughout the modern
era, ceaseless change has been the law of economic life. Every period is in
some sense a period of transition. The swift stream of events in the last
quarter century offers, however, overwhelming testimony in support of the
thesis that the economic order of the western world is undergoing in this
generation a structural change no less basic and profound in character than
that transformation of economic life and institutions which we are wont to
designate loosely by the phrase "the Industrial Revolution." We are passing,
so to speak, over a divide which separates the great era of growth and
expansion of the nineteenth century from an era which no man, unwilling
to embark on pure conjecture, can as yet characterize with clarity or precision.
We are moving swiftly out of the order in which those of our generation
were brought up, into no one knows what.


### ---Economics-1939-0-02.txt---
Overwhelmingly significant, but as yet all too little considered by
economists, is the profound change which we are currently undergoing in
the rate of population growth. In the decade of the nineteen-twenties the
population of the United States increased by 16,000,000-an absolute
growth equal to that of the pre-war decade and in excess of any other decade
in our history. In the current decade we are adding only half this number
to our population, and the best forecasts indicate a decline to a third
in the decade which we are about to enter.
Inadequate as the data are, it appears that the prodigious growth of
population in the nineteenth century was something unique in history. Gathering
momentum with the progress of modern science and transportation,
the absolute growth in western Europe mounted decade by decade until the
great World War; and in the United States it reached the highest level, as
I have just noted, in the post-war decade. The upward surge began with
relatively small accretions which rapidly swelled into a flood. But the advancing
tide has come to a sudden halt and the accretions are dwindling
toward zero.

Thus, with the prospect of actual contraction confronting us, already we
are in the midst of a drastic decline in the rate of population growth. Whatever
the future decades may bring, this present fact is already upon us; and
it behooves us as economists to take cognizance of the significance of this
revolutionary change in our economic life.
Schooled in the traditions of the Malthusian theory, economists, thinking
in terms of static economics, have typically placed an optimistic interpretation
upon the cessation of population growth. This indeed is also the interpretation
suggested by the National Resources Committee which recently
has issued an exhaustive statistical inquiry into current and prospective
changes in population growth. In a fundamental sense this conclusion is, I
think, thoroughly sound; for it can scarcely be questioned that a continued
growth of population at the rate experienced in the nineteenth century
would rapidly present insoluble problems. But it would be an unwarranted
optimism to deny that there are implicit in the current drastic shift from
rapid expansion to cessation of population growth, serious structural maladjustments
which can be avoided or mitigated only if economic policies, appropriate
to the changed situation, are applied. Indeed in this shift must be
sought a basic cause of not a few of the developments in our changing
economy.

Adam Smith regarded growth of population as at once a consequence and
a cause of economic progress. Increasing division of labor would, he argued,
bring about greater productivity, and this would furnish an enlarged revenue
and stock, from which would flow an enlarged wages fund, an increased
demand for labor, higher wages, and so economic conditions favorable for
population growth. Now a growing population, by widening the market and


### ---Economics-1939-0-03.txt---
by fostering inventiveness, in turn facilitated, he thought, division of labor
and so the production of wealth. Thus he arrived at an optimistic conclusion.
Population growth, he held, stimulated progress and this in turn stimulated
further growth and expansion. In contrast, the pessimistic analyses of
Malthus and Ricardo stressed the limitation of natural resources and the
danger of an increasing population's pressing down the margin of cultivation
to a point at which real income would be reduced to a bare subsistence
level. In this static analysis the more dynamic approach of Adam Smith was
quite forgotten. If we wish to get a clear insight into the economic consequences
of the current decline in population growth, it is necessary to return
to the suggestion of Adam Smith and to explore more fully the causal interconnection
between economic progress, capital formation and population
growth.

Economic analysis from the earliest development of our science has been
concerned with the role played by economic progress. Various writers have
included under this qaption different things; but for our purpose we may say
that the constituent elements of economic progress are (a) inventions, (b)
the discovery and development of new territory and new resources, and (c)
the growth of population. Each of these in turn, severally and in combination,
has opened investment outlets and caused a rapid growth of capital
formation.

The earlier economists were concerned chiefly with the effect of economic
progress upon the volume of output, or in other words, upon the level of
real income. For them economic progress affected the economic life mainly,
if not exclusively, in terms of rising productivity and higher real income per
capita.

Not until the very end of the nineteenth century did an extensive literature
arise which stressed the role of economic progress as a leading, if not the
main, factor causing fluctuations in employment, output, and income.
Ricardo had indeed seen that there was some relation between economic
progress and economic instability; but it was left for Wicksell, Spiethoff,
Schumpeter, Cassel, and Robertson to elaborate the thesis that economic
fluctuations are essentially a function of economic progress.
More recently the role of economic progress in the maintenance of full
employment of the productive resources has come under consideration. The
earlier economists assumed that the economic system tended automatically
to produce full employment of resources. Some unemployment there was
periodically, owing to the fluctuations incident to the business cycle; but in
the upswing phase of the cyclical movement the economy was believed to
function in a manner tending to bring about full recovery-maximum output
and employment. This view was inspired by a century in which the
forces of economic progress were powerful and strong, in which investment
outlets were numerous and alluring. Spiethoff saw clearly that technological


### ---Economics-1939-0-04.txt---
progress, the development of new industries, the discovery of new resources,
the opening of new territory were the basic causes of the boom, which in
turn was the progenitor of depression. Indeed he believed that once the main
resources of the globe had been discovered and exploited, once the whole
world had been brought under the sway of the machine technique, the leading
disturbing factors which underlie the fluctuations of the cycle would
have spent their force and an era of relative economic stability would ensue.
But he did not raise the question whether such stability would be achieved
at a full-employment and full-income level.
The business cycle was par excellence the problem of the nineteenth century.
But the main problem of our times, and particularly in the United
States, is the problem of full employment. Yet paradoxical as it may seem,
the nineteenth century was little concerned with, and understood but dimly,
the character of the business cycle. Indeed, so long as the problem of full
employment was not pressing, it was not necessary to worry unduly about
the temporary unemployment incident to the swings of the cycle. Not until
the problem of full employment of our productive resources from the longrun,
secular standpoint was upon us, were we compelled to give serious consideration
to those factors and forces in our economy which tend to make
business recoveries weak and anaemic and which tend to prolong and deepen
the course of depressions. This is the essence of secular stagnation-sick recoveries
which die in their infancy and depressions which feed on themselves
and leave a hard and seemingly immovable core of unemployment.
In every great crisis the struggle of contending groups maneuvering for
an advantageous position amidst rapid change whips up the froth and fury
of political and social controversy. Always there is present the temptation
to explain the course of events in terms of the more superficial phenomena
which are frequently manifestations rather than causes of change. It is the
peculiar function of the economist however to look deeper into the underlying
economic realities and to discover in these, if possible, the causes of
the most obstinate problem of our time-the problem of under-employment.
Fundamental to an understanding of this problem are the changes in the
"external" forces, if I may so describe them, which underlie economic progress-
changes in the character of technological innovations, in the availability
of new territory, and in the growth of population.
The expanding economy of the last century called forth a prodigious
growth of capital formation. So much was this the case, that this era in
history has by common consent been called the capitalistic period. No one
disputes the thesis that without this vast accumulation of capital we should
never have witnessed the great rise in the standard of living achieved since
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. But it is not the effect of capital
formation upon real income to which I wish especially to direct attention.
What I wish to stress in this paper is rather the role played by the process


### ---Economics-1939-0-05.txt---
of capital formation in securing at each point in this ascending income scale
fairly full employment of the productive resources and therefore the maximum
income possible under the then prevailing level of technological development.
For it is an indisputable fact that the prevailing economic system
has never been able to reach reasonably full employment or the attainment
of its currently realizable real income without making large investment expenditures.
The basis for this imperious economic necessity has been thoroughly
explored in the last half century in the great literature beginning with
Tougan-Baranowsky and Wicksell on saving and investment. I shall not attempt
any summary statement of this analysis. Nor is this necessary; for I
take it that it is accepted by all schools of current economic thought that full
employment and the maximum currently attainable income level cannot be
reached in the modern free enterprise economy without a volume of investment
expenditures adequate to fill the gap between consumption expenditures
and that level of income which could be achieved were all the factors
employed. In this somewhat truistic statement I hope I have succeeded in
escaping a hornets' nest of economic controversy.
Thus we may postulate a consensus on the thesis that in the absence of a
positive program designed to stimulate consumption, full employment of
the productive resources is essentially a function of the vigor of investment
activity. Less agreement can be claimed for the role played by the rate of
interest on the volume of investment. Yet few there are who believe that in
a period of investment stagnation an abundance of loanable funds at low
rates of interest is alone adequate to produce a vigorous flow of real investment.
I am increasingly impressed with the analysis made by Wicksell who
stressed the prospective rate of profit on new investment as the active, dominant,
and controlling factor, and who viewed the rate of interest as a
passive factor, lagging behind the profit rate. This view is moreover in accord
with competent business judgment." It is true that it is necessary to
look beyond the mere cost of interest charges to the indirect effect of the
interest rate structure upon business expectations. Yet all in all, I venture to
assert that the role of the rate of interest as a determinant of investment has
occupied a place larger than it deserves in our thinking. If this be granted,
we are forced to regard the factors which underlie economic progress as the
dominant determinants of investment and employment.
A growth in real investment may take the form either of a deepening of
capital or of a widening of capital, as Hawtrey has aptly put it. The deepening
process means that more capital is used per unit of output, while the
widening process means that capital formation grows pari passu with the


### ---Economics-1939-0-06.txt---
increase in the output of final goods. If the ratio of real capital to real
income remains constant, there is no deepening of capital; but if this ratio
is constant and real income rises, then there is a widening of capital.
According to Douglas2 the growth of real capital formation in England
from 1875 to 1909 proceeded at an average rate of two per cent per annum;
and the rate of growth of capital formation in the United States from 1890
to 1922 was four per cent per annum. The former is less than the probable
rate of increase of output in England, while the latter is somewhat in excess
of the annual rise of production in the United States. Thus, during the last
fifty years or more, capital formation for each economy as a whole has apparently
consisted mainly of a widening of capital. Surprising as it may
seem, as far as we may judge from such data as are available, there has been
little, if any, deepening of capital. The capital stock has increased approximately
in proportion to real income. This is also the conclusion of Gustav
Cassel;3 while Keynes4 thinks that real capital formation in England may
have very slightly exceeded the rise in real income in the period from 1860
to the World War. If this be true, it follows that, in terms of the time element
in production, which is the very essence of the capital concept, our system
of production is little more capitalistic now than fifty or seventy-five
years ago. It requires, in other words, a period of employment of our productive
resources no longer than formerly to reproduce the total capital stock.
The "waiting," so to speak, embodied in our capital accumulations is no
greater today than half a century or more ago. Capital has indeed grown
relative to labor. Thus the technical coefficient of production, with respect
to capital, has increased. While this indicates a more intensive application of
capital relative to the other factors, it does not necessarily imply any deepening
of capital.

In important areas the capital stock has not increased significantly even in
relation to population. This is notably true in the service industries. Moreover,
in the field of housing real capital has little more than kept pace with
population growth. In manufacturing as a whole it is certainly true that real
capital formation has not only far outstripped population but has also risen
more rapidly than physical product. The studies of Douglas for the United
States and Australia show that real fixed capital invested in manufacturing
increased more rapidly than physical output of manufactured goods. On the
other hand, Carl Snyder's5 data, which run in terms of value of invested
capital and value of product, indicate that for important separate industries,
such as textiles, iron and steel, and petroleum, capital has grown little or no
faster than output since about 1890. With respect to the automobile industry,


### ---Economics-1939-0-07.txt---
according to his findings, capital investment has risen no more rapidly
than value of product, while in the electrical industries, invested capital increased
at a slower rate than output after 1907. Considering the economy as
a whole, including fields of economic activity other than manufacturing,
there is no good evidence that the advance of technique has resulted in recent
decades, certainly not in any significant measure, in any deepening of
capital. Apparently, once the machine technique has been developed in anyfl
field, further mechanization is likely to result in an increase in output at'
least proportional to and often in excess of the net additions to real capital.
Though the deepening process is all the while going on in certain areas, elsewhere
capital-saving inventions are reducing the ratio of capital to output.
In order to get some insight into the effect of population growth upon
capital formation, it is necessary to consider the role it plays in conjunction
with other factors in the widening and deepening process. The widening
of capital is a function of an increase in final output, which in turn is due
partly to an increase in population and partly to an increase in per capita
productivity, arising from causes other than a larger use of capital per unit
of output. On the other hand, the deepening of capital results partly from
cost-reducing changes in technique, partly (though this is probably a much
less significant factor) from a reduction in the rate of interest, and partly
from changes in the character of the output as a whole, with special reference
to the amount of capital required to produce it.
Now the rate of population growth must necessarily play an important
role in determining the character of the output; in other words, the composition
of the flow of final goods. Thus a rapidly growing population will
demand a much larger per capita volume of new residential building construction
than will a stationary population. A stationary population with its
larger proportion of old people may perhaps demand more personal services;
and the composition of consumer demand will have an important influence
on the quantity of capital required. The demand for housing calls for large
capital outlays, while the demand for personal services can be met without
making large investment expenditures. It is therefore not unlikely that a
shift from a rapidly growing population to a stationary or declining one
may so alter the composition of the final flow of consumption goods that
the ratio of capital to output as a whole will tend to decline.
In the beginning stages of modern capitalism both the deepening and
the widening processes of capital formation were developing side by side.
But in its later stages the deepening process, taking the economy as a whole,
rapidly diminished. And now with the rapid cessation of population growth,
even the widening process may slow down. Moreover it is possible that
capital-saving inventions may cause capital formation in many industries to
lag behind the increase in output.
An interesting problem for statistical research would be to determine the


### ---Economics-1939-0-08.txt---
proportion of investment in the nineteenth century which could be attributed
(a) to population growth, (b) to the opening up of new territory and the
discovery of new resources, and (c) to technical innovations. Such an analysis
it has not been possible for me to make, and I shall venture only a few
rough estimates together with some qualitative judgments. With respect to
population growth some insight into the problem may perhaps be gained by
considering first the role of population growth in the rise of aggregate real
income. The various estimates agree that the annual rate of growth of physical
output up to the World War was roughly three per cent in western
Europe and nearly four per cent in the United States. Of this average annual
increase something less than half of the three per cent increase in western
Europe can be attributed to population growth, while something more than
half of the annual increase in the United States can be assigned to the
increase in the labor supply. Thus it appears that per capita output has increased
both in western Europe and in the United States at approximately
one and one-half per cent per annum. This increase can be attributed mainly
to changes in technique and to the exploitation of new natural resources.
We have already noted that capital formation has progressed at about the
same rate as the rise in aggregate output. Thus, as a first approximation, we
may say that the growth of population in the last half of the nineteenth
century was responsible for about forty per cent of the total volume of capital
formation in western Europe and about sixty per cent of the capital formation
in the United States. If this is even approximately correct, it will be seen
what an important outlet for investment is being closed by reason of the
current rapid decline in population growth.
Obviously the growth of population affects capital formation most directly
in the field of construction, especially residential building. From
decade to decade the increase in the number of dwellings had maintained a
close relation to the increase in population. In the decade of the twenties,
however, the increase in houses ran about twenty-five per cent in excess of
previous decennial increases in relation to population. According to Kuznets,
during the seven prosperous years 1923 to 1929, a quarter of the net capital
formation was residential building. But the effect of population growth on
capital formation is, of course, felt in other spheres as well. This is notably
true of all the various municipal and public utilities, and also of the manufacture
of essential consumers' goods.
An interesting excursus would lead us into a consideration of the problem
how far an increase in population itself contributed to a more efficient
technique and so was in part responsible for the rise in per capita real income.
According to the older Malthusian view, the growth of population
would act counter to the effect of technological progress upon per capita
productivity, and would thus slow down the rise in per capita real income.
If this were correct, population growth considered by itself alone would


### ---Economics-1939-0-09.txt---
tend to check the rise in per capita consumption, and this in turn, via the
so-called Relation, would affect the volume of capital formation. According
to the optimum population theory, however, it may not infrequently be the
case, and indeed probably was during the greater part of the nineteenth
century, that population growth itself facilitated mass production methods
and accelerated the progress of technique. If this be correct, population
growth was itself responsible for a part of the rise in per capita real income,
and this, via the influence of a rising consumption upon investment, stimulated
capital formation. Thus it is quite possible that population growth may
have acted both directly and indirectly to stimulate the volume of capital
formation.

It is not possible, I think, to make even an approximate estimate of the
proportion of the new capital created in the nineteenth century which was a
direct consequence of the opening up of new territory. The development of
new countries was indeed so closely intertwined with the growth of population
that it would be difficult to avoid double counting. What proportion
of new capital formation in the United States went each year into the western
frontier we do not know, but it must have been very considerable. Apparently
about one-fourth of the total capital accumulations of England were invested
abroad by 1914, and one-seventh of those of France.
These figures, while only suggestive, point unmistakably to the conclusion
that the opening of new territory and the growth of population
were together responsible for a very large fraction-possibly somewhere
near one-half-of the total volume of new capital formation in the nineteenth
century. These outlets for new investment are rapidly being closed.
The report on Limits of Land Settlement by President Isaiah Bowman and
others may be regarded as conclusive in its findings that there are no important
areas left for exploitation and settlement. So far as population is concerned,
that of western Europe has already virtually reached a standstill;
but that in eastern Europe, notably in Russia, is still growing, and so also
is that in the Orient. And much of this area will probably experience a
considerable industrialization. But it is not yet clear 'how far the mature
industrial countries will participate in this development through capital
export. Russia still has a long way to go before she becomes completely
industrialized; but foreign capital is not likely to play any significant role in
this process. India will offer some opportunity for British investment, but
the total is likely to be small relative to the volume of British foreign investments
in the nineteenth century. China and the Orient generally offer, in
view of the present and prospective turmoil in that area, relatively meager
investment opportunities. At all events, no one is likely to challenge the
statement that foreign investment will in the next fifty years play an incomparably
smaller role than was the case in the nineteenth century.
Tlhus the outlets for new investment are rapidly narrowing down to those


### ---Economics-1939-0-10.txt---
created by the progress of technology. To be sure, the progress of technology
itself played in the nineteenth century a decisive role in the opening of new
territory and as a stimulus to population growth. But while technology can
facilitate the opening of new territory, it cannot create a new world or make
the old one bigger than it is. And while the advance of science, by reducing
the death rate, was a major cause of the vast nineteenth-century increase in
population, no important further gains in this direction can possibly offset
the prevailing low birth rate. Thus the further progress of science can
operate to open investment outlets only through its direct influence on the
technique of production.
We are thus rapidly entering a world in which we must fall back upon a
more rapid advance of technology than in the past if we are to find private investment
opportunities adequate to maintain full employment. Should we
accept the advice of those who would declare a moratorium on invention and
technical progress, this one remaining avenue for private investment would
also be closed. There can be no greater error in the analysis of the economic
trends of our times than that which finds in the advance of technology,
broadly conceived, a major cause of unemployment. It is true that we cannot
discount the problem of technological unemployment, a problem which may
be intensified by the apparently growing importance of capital-saving inventions.
But, on the other side, we cannot afford to neglect that type of
innovation which creates new industries and which thereby opens new outlets
for real investment. The problem of our generation is, above all, the
problem of inadequate private investment outlets. What we need is not a
slowing down in the progress of science and technology, but rather an
acceleration of that rate.
Of first-rate importance is the development of new industries. There is
certainly no basis for the assumption that these are a thing of the past. But
there is equally no basis for the assumption that we can take for granted
the rapid emergence of new industries as rich in investment opportunities
as the railroad, or more recently the automobile, together with all the related
developments, including the construction of public roads, to which it gave
rise. Nor is there any basis, either in history or in theory, for the assumption
that the rise of new industries proceeds inevitably at a uniform pace. The
growth of modern industry has not come in terms of millions of small
increments of change giving rise to a smooth and even development. Characteristically
it has come by gigantic leaps and bounds. Very often the change
can best be described as discontinuous, lumpy, and jerky, as indeed D. H.
Robertson has so vividly done. And when a revolutionary new industry like
the railroad or the automobile, after having initiated in its youth a powerful
upward surge of investment activity, reaches maturity and ceases to grow,
as all industries finally must, the whole economy must experience a profound
stagnation, unless indeed new developments take its place. It is not


### ---Economics-1939-0-11.txt---
enough that a mature industry continues its activity at a high level on a
horizontal plane. The fact that new railroad mileage continued to be built
at about the same rate through the seventies, eighties and nineties was not
sufficient. It is the cessation of growth which is disastrous. It is in connection
with the growth, maturity and decline of great industries that the principle
of acceleration operates with peculiar force. And when giant new industries
have spent their force, it may take a long time before something else of
equal magnitude emerges. In fact nothing has emerged in the decade in
which we are now living. This basic fact, together with the virtual cessation
of public investment by state and local governmental bodies, as indicated by
a decline of $2,000,000,000 in their net public debt since 1932, explains in
large measure the necessary rise in federal expenditures.6
Spiethoff was quite right when he argued that a vigorous recovery is not
just spontaneously born from the womb of the preceding depression. Some
small recovery must indeed arise sooner or later merely because of the growing
need for capital replacement. But a full-fledged recovery calls for something
more than the mere expenditure of depreciation allowances. It requires
a large outlay on new investment, and this awaits the development of great
new industries and new techniques. But such new developments are not
currently available in adequate volume. It is my growing conviction that the
combined effect of the decline in population growth, together with the failure
of any really important innovations of a magnitude sufficient to absorb
large capital outlays, weighs very heavily as an explanation for the failure
of the recent recovery to reach full employment. Other factors are certainly
significant and important, particularly our failure to control the cost structure
and to grapple effectively with specific situations, such as those presented
by the railroads and by building construction.
We have noted that the approaching cessation of population growth
and the disappearance of new territory for settlement and exploitation may
cut off a half or more of the investment outlets which we were wont to
make in the past. We are thus compelled to fall back upon that measure of
capital formation which is associated with the advance of technique and the
rise in per capita output. But current institutional developments are restricting
even this outlet. The growing power of trade unions and trade associations,
the development of monopolistic competition, of rivalry for the
market through expensive persuasion and advertising, instead of through
price competition, are factors which have rightly of late commanded much
attention among economists. There is, moreover, the tendency to block the
advance of technical progress by the shelving of patents.
Under vigorous price competition, new cost-reducing techniques were
compulsorily introduced even though the scrapping of obsolete but undepreciated


### ---Economics-1939-0-12.txt---
machinery entailed a capital loss. But under the monopoly
principle of obsolescence new machines will not be introduced until the
undepreciated value of the old machine will at least be covered by the
economies of the new technique. Thus progress is slowed down, and outlets
for new capital formation, available under a more ruthless competitive
society, are cut off. Capital losses which could not be avoided under rigorous
price competition can be and are avoided under an economic system more
closely integrated by intercorporate association and imperfect competition.
If we are to save the one remaining outlet for private capital formation,
deliberate action of a far bolder character than hitherto envisaged must be
undertaken in order to make the price system and free enterprise sufficiently
responsive to permit at least that measure of capital formation to which the
rate of technological progress had accustomed us in the past.
Yet even though this much were achieved, it is necessary to recognize that
such a rate of progress would not provide sufficient investment outlets to
give us full employment of our resources. With a stationary population we
could maintain as rapid a rise in per capita real income as that experienced in
the past, by making annually only half the volume of new investment to
which we have been accustomed. A volume of investment adequate to provide
full employment could give us an annual percentage increase in per
capita output greatly in excess of any hitherto attained.
Various measures have been offered to maintain full employment in the
absence of an adequate rate of technological progress and of the development
of new industries. Consumption may be strengthened by the relief
from taxes which drain off a stream of income which otherwise would flow
into consumption channels. Public investment may usefully be made in human
and natural resources and in consumers' capital goods of a collective
character designed to serve the physical, recreational and cultural needs of
the community as a whole. But we cannot afford to be blind to the unmistakable
fact that a solution along these lines raises serious problems of economic
workability and political administration.
How far such a program, whether financed by taxation or by borrowing,
can be carried out without adversely affecting the system of free enterprise is
a problem with which economists, I predict, will have to wrestle in the
future far more intensely than in the past. Can a rising public debt owned
internally be serviced by a scheme of taxation which will not adversely affect
the marginal return on new investment or the marginal cost of borrowing?
Can any tax system, designed to increase the propensity to consume by means
of a drastic change in income distribution, be devised which will not progressively
encroach on private investment?7
As so often in economic life, we are confronted by a dilemma. Continued


### ---Economics-1939-0-13.txt---
unemployment on a vast scale, resulting from inadequate private investment
outlets, could be expected sooner or later to lead straight into an all-round
regimented economy. But so also, by an indirect route and a slower process,
might a greatly extended program of public expenditures. And from the
standpoint of economic workability the question needs to be raised how
far such a program can be carried out in a democratic society without raising
the cost structure to a level which prevents full employment. Thus a challenge
is presented to all those countries which have not as yet submitted to
the yoke of political dictatorship. In one of our round tables we are discussing
divergencies in the success of governmental spending in democratic
countries and in totalitarian states. Totalitarian states have the great advantage
that they can rigorously check the advance of costs, including wage
rates, while engaging in an expansionist program of public investment.
Democratic countries cannot in modern times escape from the influence
exerted by organized groups upon the operation of the price system. From
the standpoint of the workability of the system of free enterprise, there
emerges the problem of sovereignty in democratic countries confronted
in their internal economies with powerful groups-entrepreneurial and
wage-earning-which have robbed the price system of that impersonal and
non-political character idealized in the doctrine of laissez-faire. It remains
still to be seen whether political democracy can in the end survive the
disappearance of the automatic price system.
Thus we are confronted with various alternatives. On the one side, there
is the proposal to risk a negative governmental policy in the expectation
that the recuperative forces to which we have long been accustomed will,
in the absence of political interference, re-assert themselves. On the other
side, there is the proposal to go forward under full steam with unrestrained
governmental expansion until full employment has been reached. Those
who have no doubts whatever about the correctness of their economic
analyses will not hesitate to make a bold choice of policy. But others, impressed
with the stubborn economic realities of a rapidly changing world, on
the one side, and the frailties of human nature in its power to make the
appropriate adaptation to change, on the other, will not be so sure, and
may prefer to take a course that risks neither a negative policy nor a breakdown
of collective management.
With respect to the permissible role of public expenditures, I should like
to suggest that the problem might usefully be posed in terms of the national
income. In 1929 our national income was about $80,000,000,000. Taking
account of the prevailing lower level of prices, on the one side, and the
additions to the labor force, on the other, we may perhaps set the income
which should currently give us approximately full employment at about
$80,000,000,000. At the bottom of the Great Depression the national income
had fallen from $80,000,000,000 to $40,000,000,000. So drastic


### ---Economics-1939-0-14.txt---
a decline in the national income we could not again afford to risk. The consequences
for the vitality and workability of the economic system are too
serious to contemplate. I suggest-the figures are only a rough approximation-
that we cannot afford to let our income fall materially below
$65,000,000,000, or say $60,000,000,000 as a minimum. A scale of net
income-creating governmental expenditures adequate to prevent a fall in
income below this level can, it seems to me, scarcely be questioned, and
would currently, I believe, command the support of most economists. As
the national income, however, approaches $70,000,000,000, I suggest that
the net income-creating governmental expenditures ought to be tapered
off. As we approach this income level, the economic situation becomes increasingly
explosive. Bottle-necks begin to appear. Costs rise. Labor aggressively
demands wage increases. Rising costs lead to inventory speculation.
We encounter the familiar vicious spiral of rising costs and rising prices with
growing inefficiency. At this level the spending program becomes relatively
ineffective as a means to raise the real income of the community. This danger
point is clearly reached sooner in a democratic country than in a totalitarian
state. At what precise point it is reached depends upon the degree of discipline
and self-restraint which the various economic groups have achieved
or can achieve under democratic institutions. What I am suggesting is that in
the United States the upper limit of tolerance in terms of social and economic
stresses and strains may be set at around $70,000,000,000. At the
$60,000,000,000 income level we can afford to spend heavily to forestall
any further decline.
The objection will almost certainly be raised that the argument which I
have directed against continued governmental spending to the point of full
employment, could equally well be directed against private investment,
once the upper danger zone has been reached. I should doubt the validity
of this criticism. If the government continues to pour out funds at a lavish
rate, wage-earners and employers alike are prone to take the easy course
which leads to higher costs and higher prices. But if reliance could not be
placed upon a stream of purchasing power external to business itself, we
could expect, I think, a more vigorous resistance to uneconomic cost-raising
demands. Public spending is the easiest of all recovery methods, and therein
lies its danger. If it is carried too far, we neglect to attack those specific
maladjustments without the removal of which we cannot attain a workable
cost-price structure, and therefore we fail to achieve the otherwise available
flow of private investment.
There are no easy answers to the problems that confront us. And because
this is true, economists will not perform their function if they fail to illuminate
the rapidly shifting course of economic development, and through
such neglect unwittingly contribute to a dangerous lag in adjustments to
change. Equally they will not perform their function if they fail to disclose


### ---Economics-1939-0-15.txt---
the possible dangers which lurk in the wake of vastly enlarged governmental
activities. Choices indeed must be made, and scientific analysis and
painstaking research can aid by exploring the probable consequences of
alternative choices. The problems which I have raised offer a challenge to
our profession. The great transition, incident to a rapid decline in population
growth and its impact upon capital formation and the workability of a system
of free enterprise, calls for high scientific adventure along all the
fronts represented by the social science disciplines.

Once upon a time an academic economic theorist, by some freak of fate
not likely to be often repeated, got himself slightly entangled in the machinery
of formulation of government economic policy. What I plan to tell you
tonight reflects largely, though not I hope too explicitly, what the process
of policy-formulation did to his academic theorizing, and what his theorizing
failed to do to the process of policy-formulation.
As an active participant in the policy-making process, the academic
theorist suffers from a number of handicaps more or less peculiar to himself.
For purposes of teaching, or of acceptable writing for his restricted
audience of fellow-theorists, his conclusions are of little importance; and
what matters above all is the rigor and elegance of his manner of reaching
them. For policy, on the other hand, conclusions are vital, and often are
all that is vital. For the purposes of academic theorizing, the premises
the theorist starts from may without serious penalty be arbitrarily selected,
narrowly restricted in range, and purely hypothetical in nature. But the
selection of premises controls the conclusions reached, and for policydetermination
it is therefore vital that all the important variables be
covered by the analysis, and that the conclusions be not affected by the use
of premises which are irrevelant for their purposes or less realistic than
it is possible with the aid of available information to make them. To violate
these rules in policy-making is to be guilty of the grossest irresponsibility.
If he is not to be wholly in the way of the policy-maker, therefore,
the theorist must emerge from his ivory tower,-which is almost as hard
as to return to it.

The theorist's habitual methods of analysis are such as to lead to "right"
or "wrong" answers to manufactured problems, the premises and the
criteria of rightness being so chosen as to make this not only possible but
necessary. For the policy-maker, however, the problems are for the most
part not of his own devising, but are presented to him by outside forces,
in vague and ill-defined fashion, and what he asks of his advisers consists
as much of help in determining what the problems are as of help
in finding solutions for them. The theorist here is likely to find himself
uninformed and unskilled.


### ---Economics-1940-0-02.txt---
The theorist's analysis is ordinarily couched in descriptive as distinguished
from normative terms. If choices as between social values influence
his thought, these choices are largely left implicit in his selection
of premises, and are rarely, and then usually apologetically, expressly
avowed. The policy-maker, however, is rarely satisfied with purely descriptive
analysis. He insists that he be advised not only what will be the objective
consequences of a specific line of action, but whether or not these
are desirable consequences. While he has always some notions of his own
with respect to the values which policy should serve, in my experience he
always demands of his economists that they guide him also in the determination
of what is socially desirable, and he expects the economist to acknowledge
and to display some professional competence in giving such
guidance.

There are always a number of different values to be considered, moreover,
and satisfaction of one often involves disregard of the other. This
makes necessary a sort of weighing process, in which the decision is presumably
made partly on the strength of quantitative information as to the
number of persons affected by alternative courses of action, their economic
status and needs, and so forth, and partly on the basis of a qualitative
ranking of values in terms of some sort of scale of worth. The theorist
as such here also lacks experience. He is hampered, moreover, by his
tendency to dissect the mental processes by which decision is reached in
such matters, and he tends to feel and to give discomfort by his reluctance
to express in definite and assured terms the conclusions which he knows
he has reached only by vague and imperfectly communicable processes of
thought.

The effect of the action on the subject is all that the theorist has been
trained or conditioned to think about with respect to public policy. The
official and the legislator, on the other hand, should, and in any case invariably
do, think also of the effect of the action on the actor. The economist
conditioned to the purity of abstract thought is liable to be unreasonable
in his refusal to recognize that the official, in choosing his time for action
and his manner and degree of action, must give regard to their impact
on his relations with superiors, colleagues, Congress, and the public, and
to their effect on the prestige of his agency and the morale of his staff.
But the official must operate in this way if those with whom he has to deal
from day to day are to give him that cooperation and good will which are
essential not merely for his own personal success and comfort but for the
satisfactory execution of his functions.
The hbiher officials in Washington, whether they be political appointees
or career men, in my opinion, need make no apologies for their standards
even to college professors, elect of the elect though we be. As far as I have
observed, the higher officials in Washington as a group work as hard,


### ---Economics-1940-0-03.txt---
as disinterestedly, cooperate in common tasks as loyally, think as straight
within their own special fields of competence, as does the ordinary run
of college professor. They certainly do not live on the moral heights continuously,
but they are called upon more often than academic men to rise
to them, and, in my honest judgment, they respond to the call as often
and as fully as in all probability we ourselves should under like circumstances.


In one respect in particular, of special interest to economists, I have observed
them with ever-increasing admiration-namely, their patience and
generosity in their dealings with their economic advisers. In the course of
expounding the economic verities, the economists repeatedly expose their
divided counsels. They especially reveal that conflict within their ranks
between ancient dogmas and resurrected or newly-invented heresies with
which much of the remainder of my talk will deal. Those officials who
come into frequent contact with squads of economists, as they note the
repeated conflict of testimony, must feel at times like the English judge
who remarked that he had for years been trying motoring cases in which
two cars, each of them on the right side of the road and each of them
stationary, had been involved in a head-on collision-or even like that
magistrate in a native court in Ceylon who, disgusted by the flagrant
contraditions in the evidence of the successive witnesses, said to the officer
of the court: "Call the next liar." This failure of the economists to speak
as with one voice is a severe trial for the officials. I suspect, however,
that they would find us even more trying if, when unpalatable advice was
offered by one economist, they could not feel that there was a good chance
that with a little search another economist could be found happy to swear
that the advice which had been given was incredibly bad economics, or even
was "orthodox" or "sound" economics, which are now very forceful epithets
indeed in some high quarters.
To proceed with my catalogue of the handicaps of the economic theorist
as a policy-maker. The economists of my generation and earlier were
trained to concentrate on so-called long-run analysis in their pure theorizing.
When they ventured into the discussion of questions of public policy,
they accordingly tended to be preoccupied with the long view, with the
effects which a given action would have on the more distant future, and
to disregard or to weigh lightly its more immediate effects. A good illustration
of what I have in mind is the famous poor-law controversy in
England in the 1830's. The leading economists of the time all emphasized
the allegedly injurious effects on the productive capacity and the will to
work and to save of the poor which would result from generous, longsustained,
and assured poor-relief to the able-bodied. They stressed even
more the growth of population and the consequent impairment of the
basic earning power of labor which they believed would ultimately result


### ---Economics-1940-0-04.txt---
from any substantial liberation of the poor from dependence solely on
their own efforts for the means of subsistence of themselves and their
children. The extreme conservatives and the extreme radicals of the timewho,
as so often in history, were on the same side on a specific issue-and
also the humanitarians and clergy, stressed in opposition to the views
of the economists the moral and political rights of the needy to be given
food and shelter with a minimum of humiliation and of deliberate interference
with their accustomed patterns of family and social life. In this
instance, as in many others, it was possible plausibly to picture the clash
between the long view and the short as a clash between the humane and
the hard-hearted, although the economists of the time of course insisted
that the policy they advocated, while immediately severe, would ultimately
prove to be the kinder of the two to the poor.
Although it is obviously not without direct relevance to present-day
problems, I am not concerned here with the merits of this ancient controversy.
I have cited it only to help make clear the differing turn which
may be given to public policy accordingly as the long view or the short
is dominant, and to illustrate the characteristic approach of the orthodox
economist, from that day to this, to policy questions.
Now this habit of taking the long view is not only characteristic of the
orthodox economic theorist, but in the discussion of matters of economic
policy it is often the principal characteristic by which he can be distinguished
from other professional economists or even from the intelligent
layman.

In the day-to-day process of adapting public policy to meet felt needs,
on the other hand, the problems always manifest themselves in the form
of immediate pressures of one sort or another, and the legislator or
official tends to look for correspondingly immediate solutions. This is
"natural" behavior, in the sense both that it is what one should expect
to occur, and that it has its socially useful aspects.
Legislators and officials are typically busy and harried men. Except
under the special circumstances of major election campaigns, when the
pattern of party debate may by chance turn on the relative merits of the
long-run programs of the contending parties, and except for the occasional
opportunity of the legislator or the official to divest himself of the cares
of the moment and, assuming the role of the statesman, to give patient
examination to the needs of the future, there is constant preoccupation
with the problems which are immediately pressing, and little stimulus to
take thought as to whether the proffered solutions are likely to prove
lasting ones. There is especially little urge to go hunting for problems
which are not yet felt as such but which may prove troublesome in the
distant future.

It would be a mistake, however, to take for granted that the immediate


### ---Economics-1940-0-05.txt---
solution, the quickly-working one, is of necessity a defective one. The
immediate solution to a problem no doubt frequently serves also with
tolerable satisfaction as a permanent one, and in some cases may well be
identical with the optimum permanent solution. Many problems, moreover,
are themselves temporary in nature, and require therefore only
temporary solutions. The immediate solution may be the only one for
which public acceptance is obtainable, so that there is really no choice.
There are circumstances, moreover, under which even a benevolent dictator,
with no need to give heed to public clamor, would be wise to adopt a
partial and temporary, but quick-working, solution in preference to a
more complete and more lasting one which would yield its benefits only
after considerable delay. Mr. Keynes, speaking with at least a trace of the
accent of revelation, has told us that in the long run we'll all be dead.
What I presume he meant by this apparently crystal-clear dictum was that
if we took the long view, we, including our otherwise potential posterity,
would-or might-all be dead-or dead or unborn-before that view
could justify itself. This warning is scarcely much needed either by the
public official or by the ordinary legislator, but for the reasons I have
stated and not only because in respectable communities the dead and the
unborn cast no votes. But for the academic economist it is a sound warning,
and perhaps even a needed one. In times of severe social strain there
may be real menace of catastrophe if there is not resort, even at the cost of
bad after-effects, to a quick-working remedy which tides the economy over
the crisis. At such times, the patience of the orthodox theorist may be out
of place. But in the past, at least, such times have come only rarely.
Closely related to the habit of the theorist of preoccupying himself
with those effects of proposed legislation which are more distant in time
is his habit of searching for the repercussions of legislation which are soto-
speak more distant in space. Politicians are experts in tracing one kind
of repercussion, the political. But they are indisposed to take account of
economic repercussions, as the history of tariff controversy abundarntly
demonstrates. This indisposition, I think, they share with the general lay
public, to whom, in matters of economic analysis, one step at a time is
enough, if not too much. And since what the public doesn't know can't
hurt the legislator, he has at least no selfish motive for following the
theorist in his unsteady and circuitous wanderings from the proximate to
the secondary, to the tertiary effects, and is content to act in terms of the
seen, with worry about the unseen left to the economic theorist as a sort of
occupational psychosis.
I do not include in my list of the handicaps peculiar to the economic
theorist as a participant in the policy-formulating process two items which
would probably appear high on such a list if prepared by those with
whom the economist works-namely, first, his ignorance as a rule of the


### ---Economics-1940-0-06.txt---
legal framework and legal folklore to which legislative drafting and the
administration of the laws must conform; and second, his lack of experience
and insight with respect to what is and what is not administratively
feasible. These are omitted, however, not because the ordinary economist
does have command of these skills, and not because they are unimportant,
for such is decidedly not the case in either instance. But barriers to effectiveness
of this general type, instead of being peculiar to economic theorists,
are common to all kinds of specialized participants in a co6perative enterprise
such as policy-formulation which makes demands upon a wider
range of skills than single individuals can reasonably be expected to
possess. The lack of legal and administrative training on the part of the
economic theorist may be regrettable, but it is not fatal as long as he is
not permitted to decide policy questions all on his own.
In the ordinary course of events, policy is, of course, ultimately decided
not by the technical experts as such, whether they be economists or engineers
or political scientists or sociologists, but by the legislators and the
responsible executives with the aid of advice by the experts. That excellent
formula, "The expert should be on tap, not on top" would be almost
equally valid if it went, "The expert is on tap, not on top." This applies no
more and no less to the economist than to the other professions-except for
the lawyer, who is on tap and on top, and omnipresent, omniscient,
omnipotent, and omnivorous in addition. In the process of tapping the
experts for their specialized knowledge and skills, the technical equipment
of one profession provides the offset for the gaps in the capacities
of the others. And for those many things which in a world not clearly
designed for full comprehension by man are beyond human knowledge, the
lawyer always stands ready to provide precise formulae acceptable to the
Supreme Court as unambiguous expressions of legislative intent.
Even with these two items omitted, the list of handicaps of the academic
economic theorist as a participant in the formulation of public policy
which I have given is discouragingly long. Others, moreover, would probably
think they could easily make it even longer and even more discouraging
to the theorist. Let it be clear, however, that I am not identifying
the few "academic economic theorists" with economists in general, and
that I recognize that there are many other types of economists whose
serviceability in policy-formulation and in other activities of government has
been amply and unquestionably demonstrated.
The non-theoretical economist, in particular, or the economist who disclaims
any theoretical prejudices, is in fact much more adaptable to public
service than the economic theorist with some body of theory to which
he remains faithful, whatever its species. The non-theorist can adjust
himself quickly to the changing flow of events and issues. He is not bound
by any set mode of analysis. His mind but lightly encumbered by doctrines,


### ---Economics-1940-0-07.txt---
dogmas, preconceptions, or even in some cases thoughts, the fortunate man
can move freely in any direction, wherever the wind may list. If he feels
the need for guidance, tnere is always available today yesterday's position
of his official superiors and tomorrow the different position they took today.
In finding good-sounding reasons for what has already been decided upon,
he has a distinctive and useful function, both because the vitality of the
democratic process is dependent upon our continuing to believe that it
provides us with reasonably wise and beneficent government, and also because
statesmen's intuitions have often a genuine economic logic dimly in
their background. He shares also with other types of economists the useful
role of finding good uses for bad laws, and thus contributes to the
most important function of the art of public administration: the making
of silk purses out of legislative sows' ears.
The handicaps of the academic theorist of the older dispensation as
a useful member of a policy-formulating staff are probably even more
clearly visible to other members of the economic profession than to members
of other professions. There is in fact a definite cleavage between the habits
of thought of this species of theorist and those of other groups in the
profession, including many of those who help guide Leviathan in its daily
gyrations. The continued depression has obviously made a deep impression
on the latter, and made them impatient of or even violently hostile to the
traditional corpus of economic theory, which they look upon as an instrument
for the exercise of the tyranny of the dead mind over the living. They
seem to believe increasingly that its role has been, even in the long-past days
of its almost unchallenged dominance, "to light fools the way to dusty
death." The world it approvingly describes of atomistic competition, and
the ethical approval which, as they read it, it translates to the actual world
by its failure clearly to contrast the ideal with the real, make it appear
to them too far divorced from the present-day realities and values to warrant
faith in its usefulness as an aid to the guidance of social policy. Instead
of the economy of effective competition, of freedom of individual
initiative, of equality of economic opportunity, of steady and full employment,
pictured in the traditional theory, they see an economy dominated
by giant corporations in almost every important field of industry outside
agriculture, an economy marked by great concentration of wealth and
economic power, and great disparity of income and of opportunity for
betterment. They note the apparently unending flow of evidence from
investigating committees and courts of the flagrant misuse of concentrated
economic power. They observe with alarm the failure of our economy for
ten successive years to give millions of men able to work and anxious to
work the opportunity to earn their daily bread. And seeing the actual
world so, they refuse to accept as useful for their purposes a type of
economic theory which as they read it either ignores these evils or treats


### ---Economics-1940-0-08.txt---
them as temporary, self-correcting aberrations or excrescences of what is
basically a sound economic system. Having rejected the conventional picture
of the system, they tend increasingly to adopt another one, rapidly approaching
equal conventionalization, but following another pattern, in
which the evils are inherent in the system and cannot be excised without its
drastic reconstruction and its substantial operation by government.
Their account of the traditional economic theory is not wholly a caricature,
but it is overdrawn and distorted. It deliberately disregards the failure
of government to behave according to the rules laid down by the orthodox
theory as necessary if its conclusions are to have practical validity, and
it especially overlooks the long line of great men in the orthodox tradition,
by no means already at an end, who by no stretch of the imagination
can be charged with having exploited it to protect evils against reform.
But this is in the present connection significant only as it prejudices these
zealous reformers against utilizing for their own good purposes the aid
the old doctrines can still furnish. Their picture of the evils of the present
economic system may also be painted in too strident colors, but it is undoubtedly
close enough to the truth to make complacency indefensible.
Where in my opinion they are most gravely in error, however, is that in
rejecting lock-stock-and-barrel the traditional economic theory, they are
abandoning habits of mind and analytical tools which are still essential if
evils are not only correctly to be identified but are to be ascribed to their
proper causes, and if remedies are not to be advocated which may prove
worse than the diseases they are prescribed for.
As a by-product of the breach with the older body of doctrine, the
economic profession is tending to wipe out that line of cleavage which in
this country has been so marked almost since the foundation of the Economic
Association between the teachings of the professional economists,
on the one hand, and the practices of government and the beliefs of the
lay public, on the other hand. I, for one, would welcome this reconciliation
if it resulted from our final conversion of the lay public. I think,
however, that the reverse has happened to a substantial extent, and that
economic doctrine is now following public opinion and government practice
much more than it is influencing them. For obvious reasons which have
no counterpart in this country, this is now of course the routine situation
in totalitarian countries. Its occurrence in this country is not, I am certain,
due to any significant extent to a new subservience of the profession to
external opinion. Its explanation lies largely, I think, in the fact that under
the impact of depression conditions the economists have in large numbers
abandoned the traditional economic doctrines, with their emphasis on the
long view, and have turned instead to the short view which government
and the lay public have always tended to take. It is true that in adopting
the short view many of the younger economists have not merely taken


### ---Economics-1940-0-09.txt---
over the lay notions bodily. Some of them have, in fact, given them a
theoretical elaboration which for subtlety, refinement, and elegance need
make no apologies to the older economics, and which remains faithful
to older theorizing in at least one, respect, that the tradition of unintelligibility
to the layman is scrupulously observed. It is the quality of the judgment
displayed, and not the quality of the analytical skill, which I venture
to question. No matter how refined and how elaborate the analysis,
if it rests solely on the short view it will still be close to the layman's economics
and still be a structure built on shifting sands.
My aim this evening is not to praise the old-fashioned economic theorist,
but only to help protect him from premature burial. The strongest line of
defense I find available is the argument that he is the special custodian for
society of the long view in economic matters, and that even in troubled
periods that view is entitled not to undisputed dominance but to a full
hearing. Since its value with reference to any specific issue can be tested
only empirically and therefore only after a substantial period of time has
elapsed, I shall present my case for the long view forward by taking the
long view back into history with respect to several of the doctrines in
the orthodox tradition. Not to make it too easy for myself, I shall deal
only with doctrines that have been so conventionalized through time that
they seem to the short-viewers flagrant examples of the freezing of doctrine
into dogmas whose venerability is their only claim to virtue.
An underlying characteristic of the orthodox Anglo-American economics
during its entire period of dominance was its basically optimistic outlook
on the prospective trend of events. As a cursory inspection of the files of
presidential addresses before the American Economic Association and its
English prototype would confirm, the economists of the time believed that,
despite wars, mistakes in government policy, and cyclical disturbances,
private initiative, technological progress, and the improvement and wider
diffusion of education had resulted in and would continue to result in a
slowly rising secular trend of per capita income, enjoyed by steadily-growing
populations. Imbued with this moderately optimistic long view, the
economists listened neither to the occasional prophets of impending and
lasting woe nor to the more frequent peddlers of patented devices for
antedating the millennium. For the period up to 1914 at least, they proved
on the whole to have been right. In the flush days of the 1920's, however,
we were told: that what was then would continue to be, forever and ever;
that the problem of the cycle had been solved by the Federal Reserve Board;
and that we had entered upon a new era of perpetual boom. The great
bulk of the economic profession, taking the long view, refused to give
credence to this blissful picture. How right they proved we are unfortunately
only too well aware. The perpetual boom having come to its dramatic
end, it later subsequently became increasingly apparent that all the days


### ---Economics-1940-0-10.txt---
of the 1930's were to be black, or gray. Some economists, simulating too
closely, I think, the technocrats' over-emphasis of the purely technological
elements in economic process and under-emphasis of the compensating and
stimulating functions of the price system, and responding too sympathetically
to the prevailing depression, have announced a second new era, but
this time an era of perpetual gloom, the advent of the stagnant economy.
There is even developing among the preachers of the new pessimism impatience
with talk in terms of the concepts of business-cycle analysis, as
carrying the unnecessarily optimistic implication that what goes down
may some day come up. I have no doubt myself that these economists
have genuinely succeeded in finding historical trends in our economic
structure and process which operate to make the attainment of full employment
increasingly difficult. But that must always have been true, and
the weight to be attached to such findings should not be decided until
equally ardent search has been made for factors operating in the opposite
direction. Here, I take it, is an instance where appeal to the long view
may save us from accepting as an adequately historical approach what
fuller appeal to history would suggest was rather a hysterical approach.
It has long been standard dogma that budgets must be annually balanced,
and that public debts must not be allowed to grow indefinitely. Governments,
of course, have frequently violated the dogma, and not only have
such violations not invariably been followed by disaster, but it would be
a difficult task to disprove the proposition that in a substantial number of
instances they proved highly beneficial. But as I read the history of the
budget-balancing dogma, it developed as a convenient rule-of-thumb protection
against the defense of uncontrolled expenditure and continuous
deficits by the plea that the appropriate time for budget balancing was not
quite yet but just around the corner. I am even convinced that most of
the distinguished advocates of budget balancing during the nineteenth
century would have conceded, though no doubt grudgingly, that even a
continuous growth of public debt, given a moderate and asymptotic pattern
of growth, would not in fact necessarily lead to disaster. On this
question of the menace of a growing debt that virtuoso of the long view,
Adam Smith, maintained his usual balance. When, during the American
Revolutionary War, a young friend, Sir John Sinclair, lamented to him the
misfortunes, presumably financial, in which the war was involving Britain,
and exclaimed, "If we go on at this rate, the nation must be ruined!",
Adam Smith replied, "Be assured, my young friend, that there is a great
deal of ruin in a nation."
But when for the old dogma that budgets should be annually balanced
there is substituted a new dogma that budget balancing is merely a fetish,
that as long as there are unemployed resources, whatever the cause of


### ---Economics-1940-0-11.txt---
the unemployment, governments should point with pride to their lusty
and bouncing deficits, instead of apologizing for them or shamefacedly
concealing them as if they were born out of wedlock, the long view tells
me that while this may not be the road to ruin it at least blazes a trail to
it. It must not be forgotten that spending in itself is for the spenders the
supreme pleasure, is the politicians' delight, and that what temperance in
resort to it has prevailed in the past has been wholly due to the belief that
somebody, some day, would have to be taxed to pay the bills. Even if this
belief were properly to be regarded as completely a myth, it would still be
one of the large class of highly useful myths.
Two related theses of the liberal tradition in Anglo-American thought
have been: first, that under a system of free individual enterprise a higher
level of economic well-being was attainable than under any other form of
economic organization; and second, that a society organized on this
economic basis was the only one compatible with the maintenance of
political democracy. These, of course, are dogmas, not axioms, one economic
and the other political in nature. Now that political democracy is
under attack, frankly from the fascist right and as menacingly though not
as frankly from the communist left which, like the serpent, licks its victim
over before it swallows it, the political dogma has become increasingly
acceptable even to those who reject the economic dogma. My concern
here, however, is only with the economic dogma, whose acceptability has
been destroyed or seriously impaired even for many economists by ten years
of sustained and severe depression.
There are perhaps some economists who would deny that an individualistic
system is at all desirable economically. This view I will not discuss,
since even if I were to reject a substantially individualistic system on
economic grounds, I should still prefer it, on non-economic grounds, to
what seems to me to be its only practicable alternative, a comprehensivelyplanned
economy under which, as some one has said, "All our hairs would
be numbered, and all gray." There are many, however, who hold the view
that while a system of free individual enterprise would be ideal if attainable,
it is no longer possible in these modern days of great concentration of
ownership and control of productive facilities, where the economic units
are to a large extent huge corporations and trade unions rather than the
single individuals of traditional economic theory, and where such competition
as persists tends increasingly to be competition between giants
instead of the atomistic competition of orthodox theory, and therefore to
be cost-raising rather than price-reducing.
When, some four or five generations ago, freedom of private initiative
was first systematically advocated as the ideal basis for an economic system,
the menace of monopoly to the proper working of a system so organized


### ---Economics-1940-0-12.txt---
was clearly perceived. It was then widely believed, however, that, although
business-men admittedly found abhorrent the impact upon themselves of
other persons' competition and grasped every opportunity to escape it,
monopolistic power could not come into being on a large scale, or at least
could not long maintain itself, except with government aid and sanction.
In justice to those who were of this view, it should be noted that the
grant of a corporate charter was then universally regarded as the grant of a
special privilege potentially dangerous to society, and it was therefore then
assumed as a matter of course that such grants would be made only sparingly
and would be jealously circumscribed, in each specific instance, by
restrictions as to permitted size, nature and range of activities, and right
of participation in the civil liberties enjoyed by genuine individuals.
Whether now, after several generations of unrestrained grant of corporate
charters and of great development of mass-production requiring large
economic units for its operation, it is still possible, through proper regulation
and restriction by government of the activities of large corporations, to
restore an essentially competitive price system, is a question to which I
freely confess I do not see a clear answer, although I look forward eagerly
for much-needed enlightenment to those sessions of this meeting where this
question will be discussed by an exceptionally-qualified group who, I have
reason to know, have been giving it very serious and disinterested consideration.
The only point I wish to make now is that the old dogma,
that monopoly power is basically the product of governmentally protected
or sanctioned special privilege and will not survive on a large scale if such
special privilege is withdrawn or kept to its practically minimal limits,
still has sufficient plausibility to warrant further inquiry. It seems to me
a reasonable hypothesis, one worth examination, for instance, that if much
of the impressive array of governmental encouragements to monopoly
could be removed, or, where removal was impracticable, if government
regulation were directed to foster cyclical patterns of price-behavior following
the competitive pattern, the chief evil product of monopoly, the
price-inflexibility problem, would shrink to easily tolerable dimensions.
Consider for instance, some of the elements in the prevailing pattern of
government relationship to monopoly and to price-inflexibility. Promiscuous
issue of wide-open corporate charters by the states; until within the
last year or two slack and faint-hearted enforcement of the anti-trust laws,
already gutted by court sabotage; protection of monopolistic price-structures
by the federal tariff; positive encouragement of monopolistic pricepractices
by such legislation as the N.R.A. act, the Webb-Pomerene act,
the Guffey Coal act; so-called "fair-trade" laws which compel businessmen
to act as if they were monopolists even if they wish not to; concealed
protection of monopoly by doctored building and other ordinances; tacit
encouragement to monopoly through acceptance in government contracts,


### ---Economics-1940-0-13.txt---
systematically and without protest, of identical bids and of list prices higher
than even the monopolists can obtain in what remains of the open market;
approval, and even enforcement, for regulated industries such as railroads,
of rate policies which make rates behave even more perversely, as
far as cyclical flexibility is concerned, than the prices of unregulated monopolies;
encouragement to and protection of labor monopolies; deliberate
schooling of agriculture in the pleasures and profits of monopolistic behavior.


The record of government encouragement to monopoly, when looked at
in conjunction with government's spasmodic efforts to enforce competition
and its intermittent clamor against monopoly, reminds me, and justifiably
so, of an old cartoon I once saw, depicting a political demonstration in
the streets of London, in which the determined-looking marchers carried
two banners, one of which bore the slogan, "NO MONOPOLY!" and the
other the slogan, "NO COMPETITION!"
All that I suggest, therefore, with respect to the dogma that free competition
can substantially survive if government gives it due protection
and encouragement, is not that its validity under modern conditions is
obvious, but that we have not the right definitely to reject it before it has
been given an honest and thorough test.
As a final illustration of the possible survival of usefulness of old dogmas
which were the product of the long view, I cite the proposition that the
timidity of capital makes the maintenance of "business confidence" necessary
if investment is to be maintained at the level required for sustained
prosperity. According to this dogma, the capitalist will hoard his own
money, or will send it abroad-be there any safe place to send it-and
will refrain from borrowing other people's money for investment purposes,
if even a faint shadow is cast on the political security of his investment.
The spokesmen for capital have found this dogma very much to their
liking, and have been claiming for some six years that a political shadow
has been cast over the security of their investments, and that this has been
responsible for the low rate of new investment, and consequently for the
persistence of depression. To reinforce their claims, they have done their
trembling in public, with vocal accompaniments.
There is no specific invocation of old dogmas, I understand, which the
economists of the new enlightenment regard as more absurd, more insubstantial
and unsubstantiated, than the claim that the timidity of investment
capital under the impact of political fears has been a significant factor in
causing the low rate of new investment of the past six years or so. The
capitalist, they agree, is a timid beast, but they assert that it is only the risk
of loss he is really timid about. He invests, they say, when he sees a clear
chance of profit, and hoards when he doesn't, regardless of whether the


### ---Economics-1940-0-14.txt---
government of the day is stroking his fur or barking at him. They point
out that the annual volume of new investment was even smaller in 1931
and 1932 than in any year since 1933, although if in these earlier years
political shadows were being cast on the security of investment they could
not have been more than mere foreshadowings of prospective shadows.
They cite also the substantial recovery of the new investment level in 1936-
37, when capital was still insisting that it was scared. They have even
produced a statistical proof that "confidence" has nothing to do with the
volume of investment, which takes the form of a demonstration that the
rate of investment is so highly correlated with the rate of retail sales or
of consumers' spending that no other factor need be invoked to explain
its major fluctuations.
To my perhaps naive mind, the dogma still carries some shreds of
credibility, despite those weighty inductive refutations. As I understand
it, the dogma is not that the degree of confidence in the intentions of
government with respect to invested capital alone governs the rate of investment,
but merely that some minimum degree of such confidence is a
necessary condition of the continuance of investment at a high level. The
correspondence of the rate of investment with the rate of retail sales seems
at least as available to support the thesis that the rate of investment determines
the level of national income, to which thesis even the most timid
capitalist will happily subscribe, as to support the argument that the rate
of spending of income governs the rate of investment. But the only prachas
any designs on capital, it would be wiser to bite before and bark aftertical
lesson I care to draw from the possible validity of this dogma of the
timidity of capital in the face of political threats is that, if government
wards, if bark it must.
I hope-but do not expect-that I shall not be misunderstood as holding
that full and invariably appropriate guidance for government policy under
present-day conditions can be found in the old dogmas or in what could
until recently be called "accepted" economic doctrine. I know no economist
who would take this position, and if one were to be found I should agree
that he was trying to make a fool's paradise out of his private ivory tower.
My claim is much more moderate and, I hope, much more sensible. What
I contend is that for various reasons, but chiefly as a psychological reaction
to the impact of continued and acute depression, some economists
have been discarding too indiscriminately their inherited intellectual ballast,
with the result that they sway too easily with each passing wind. With
apologies to you for the form in which I state my claim, I contend merely
that there is life in the old dogmas yet. I concede that new light is needed
and all that I ask is that our minds be kept open to acceptance, strictly and
only on their merits, of both the old lights and the new.
Nor do I ask for a sympathetic hearing for the old dogmas in the belief


### ---Economics-1940-0-15.txt---
or desire that such a hearing would lead to a cessation or even slowingup
of the present endeavors to find remedies for prevailing evils through
positive government action. Obedience to some of the old dogmas would
in fact lead to an intensification of governmental action. As far as I am
concerned, I have been much more impressed by the undue inertia of
government in the face of acknowledged evils than by its rash venturesomeness
in action, although I think I have seen both qualities displayed.
It is not a middle way between action and inaction, therefore, which I
urge. It has been said that throughiout all the history of man Confucius
alone succeeded in making the middle way either emotionally exciting or
intellectually stimulating, and I have my doubts even about Confucius. As
many persons who appeal to the middle way use the term, it really becomes
a disguised plea that we should halt between the premises and their
conclusions. That is not what I am pleading for. Let evils be dealt with,
promptly and decisively. But in choosing the manner and direction of
action, let us pay heed to the old as well as the new wisdom, and let us
especially beware of old poisons in new bottles.

In periods of war and revolution scholarship is not immune to, the forces
that affect human events. There is a tradition--an honorable tradition-of
scientific aloofness, of exclusive concern with the affairs of the mind and
the spirit at such times, but it is a tradition difficult to keep alive in an era
of total war. As individual human beings, of course, scholars feel the
weight of conflict. Many are affected as disciples of arts that have important
uses in the prosecution of war. Most immediate is the impact of revolutionary
war on social scientists, for the very subject matter of their disciplines
may be altered under the stress of profound civil disturbance. Not
least is economics involved in such changes. The full violence of the present
disorders has perhaps not yet been experienced by our science, but it needs
no prophet to suggest that the effects will be far-reaching and enduring.
Some of these effects we have already felt. Abroad, in regions where
freedom of economic thought has long prevailed, we have seen economics
reduced to a subservient art. Our colleagues have been silenced. The great
economic journals of continental Europe are dead. Throughout the world
opportunity for objective study has been seriously impaired, at a time when
it is sorely needed. But these are not the only reasons for disquiet. If we
face the realities of economic life, and set against these realities our theories,
our analytical tools, our ability to devise and direct instruments of control,
we must confess to inadequacy. Our needs outrun our means of understanding.
In his presidential address five years ago Maurice Clark said that
the mood of our generation of economists is one of doubtful potency in
the face of a great crisis. That mood has not been relieved, certainly, by
any lessening of the crisis since he spoke.
This feeling stands in sharp contrast to that of our nineteenth-century
predecessors. Except for a few troubled spirits, these economists felt at
home in a mastered world. The institutional framework had been set. The
essential nature of economic processes, tending eternally toward equilibrium
in this enduring framework, had been established. The form and central
substance of organized economic knowledge seemed to have been defined.
I do not imply that complacency dominated the thinking of these men.


### ---Economics-1941-0-02.txt---
Their belief was a reflection of the Victorian confidence that certain ultimate
values in life had been grasped and cast into institutional molds that would
endure. Indeed, it was expected that with the diffusion of western culture
these institutions would spread, and that economic principles based on them
would apply with increasing validity to a world economic order.
These hopes have not been realized. The institutions of whose enduring
value men were so assured seventy-five years ago have been challenged, and
have lost ground. The course of development that seemed so clearly delineated
has been reversed. The world to which the principles of nineteenthcentury
economics seemed so appropriate has found its borders steadily
restricted.

Today emotion, prejudice and narrow nationalism speak in the name of
economics in centers we used to respect. An oppressinfg sense of inadequacy
troubles us in the face of domestic emergencies. When we face these facts
it is inevitable that we should be concerned as to where we stand and
where we are going, as to the objectives, procedures, and prospects of our
discipline. Tonight, exercising the freedom that goes with this occasion,
I venture to indulge in some reflections on the present state of economics,
to discuss some of the reasons for current difficulties, and to touch on certain
of the responsibilities confronting us today.
I have suggested that we cannot today feel at home in an orderly world.
The reasons for this are not to be found in the immediate crisis alone. A
shift of attention, in economics, from systems and laws to facts and events
antedates this crisis. In some degree our present disquiet is a result of this
shift. There are times in every field of thought when system-building predominates.
There have been periods in the social sciences when the working
out of general laws was the chief concern of students, when men were
content to sit on the heights of speculation with little regard to particulars,
when the processes of social life were of primary interest as manifestations
of moral principles or of a natural order of things. But intellectual climates
change. The aesthetic urge that leads men to seek unity in mental constructs
at the expense of conformity to reality ceases to dominate thought, and
curious minds turn again to the observation and understanding of phenomena.


The causes of these swings, which are discernible in the history of economics
as in the history of other disciplines, are in some degree obscure.
Just why the pallid introspection of scholasticism gave place, in time, to the
fresh, eager interest in life of the Elizabethans, I do not know. Great opportunities
and emergent needs growing out of urgent pressures doubtless
played a part.

Such opportunities and such needs, combined with a great advance in
the power and scope of observation, have helped to direct economists of
our generation to a more searching and more comprehensive scrutiny of


### ---Economics-1941-0-03.txt---
economic phenomena. Under this scrutiny there has been revealed, not
an economic universe of simple and relatively unchanging attributes, but a
world bristling with variation and pulsing with change. This revelation
makes, I think, for health in our discipline, and is promising for the
ultimate future. But it does not make for a sense of complete adequacy,
when we set our tools of thought against the tangled confusions of economic
reality.

Shifts over time are a phase of the complexity we face when we center
attention on phenomena. Such shifts are always occurring. Our present
troubles in seeking to understand and interpret economic life are intensified
by revolutionary alterations in economic institutions and processes.
After a long century of relative order, comparative security and slow secular
modification of the ways of social life, these ways are now being swiftly
altered. Social habits and political systems which to the preceding generation
seemed virtually immutable are, for millions, subject to over-night transformation.
The slow tempo of evolution, in terms of which our fathers
thought of social change, appears to have given way to short-order reconstruction
of the systems by which men live. Of course, this sense of rapid
change is in some degree illusory. Staggered by the dizzy pace of life in
the world of headlines and radios we lose sight of the more enduring
features of the real world. When time brings a truer perspective, the actual
modifications of institutions and ways of living will perhaps appear less
revolutionary. But with due allowance for illusion, we may expect the
events of recent months and years to affect us profoundly.
Economic change, striking national and world economies with uneven
incidence, produces a welter of discrepant forms. This is true even in our
own relatively sheltered state. Domestically we have a complex mixture of
elements in our economy, with units of private enterprise, partially regulated
enterprise, closely controlled enterprise and publicly administered
enterprise struggling toward mutual adjustment and harmonious interworking.
The competitive elements of contemporary economic life have not
been effectively integrated with the regulated and controlled elements.
There result diversity in administrative forms and friction in the relations
among economic elements. These make more difficult the task of understanding.


In the international sphere disturbances have been more pronounced.
Even before the most recent breakdown, international economic relations
were sharply at variance with the ideal of a free world economy. Today
there is no world order. The laws of trade in a free world market have
little meaning in an era of economic autarchy, with such trade as is not on
a barter basis hedged about by a host of restrictions. The body of economic
doctrine dealing with the international movements of goods and means of
payment when commerce is unfettered-one of the truly impressive creations


### ---Economics-1941-0-04.txt---
of economic thought-has slight relevance to these conditions. It is
true, of course, that a world economic order built on other bases than the
law of comparative costs is possible. The hand of totalitarian control can
dig new trade channels and bring orderliness of a kind into international
relations. But while we wait upon the restoration of the old order, or the
contrivance of a new one, we face a disorganized world economy and a
great impairment of productive power.
Alteration of the conditions of economic life may go further than
structural modification. Continuity that is manifest in the persistence of
patterns of change is as necessary to organized economic knowledge as is
orderliness of structure. Patterns of secular development and of cyclical
movements are examples of orderliness in change, even though they be
overlaid with a screen of variation. Here, as elsewhere, continuity is impressed
on economic activities by enduring institutions, by technological
necessities, by the persistence of consumption habits among large populations,
and by many other factors. But continuity in human affairs is always
impierfect. Time brings changes in institutions, in technologies, even in the
behavior of consumers. The profound and rapid shifts of recent years have
intensified such disruptions. They have broken the chain of secular evolution,
heightened variation in patterns of cyclical change, and altered many
of the established modes of economic life. This accentuation of discontinuities
is a chief cause of the uncertainties that trouble us today.
But it is not alone the external facts of change and discontinuity that
induce this feeling. These are but one side of the shield. The other side is
the conceptual, for understanding involves the fitting of observations into
an ordered body of thought. The full story is that these manifold disturbances
have made much harder our central task of harmonizing objective
facts and systems of economic thought. Perhaps the best example of this,
and one that lies close to the heart of our present problem, is found in the
concept of the free market, and in the existing cleavage, in this field,
between facts and traditional concepts.
The free market, as the battleground of competitive forces, has been,
of course, a central element in the economic organization of the western
world. In the realm of ideas, too, the sovereign market has been an
essential component of systematic economics. The forms into which economic
thought has been cast for one hundred and fifty years have been
shaped by it. Today this free market, and the automatic attainment of
economic harmony through the market, seem much farther from reality
than they did a generation ago. The system of ideas built on the concept
of the free market is correspondingly weakened, as an aid to understanding
and an instrument for the organization of knowledge.
It is a familiar fact, but one with clear relevance to present issues, that
antecedents of this body of ideas are found in Newtonian mechanics. That


### ---Economics-1941-0-05.txt---
system, with its balance of forces in a stable and unchanging universe, was
a major element in the intellectual environment of the men who created
formal economics. It provided the concept of law as a ruling force, the
notion of a fixed order in Nature, and a variety of analogies suggestive of
ways in which the data of economics might be organized.
A particular conjuncture served to give this approach prestige, historical
timeliness and no small degree of validity. Just when the mechanistic pattern
was becoming the model of scientific perfection, the move for a free
market was given impetus from other quarters and on other grounds. Adam
Smith's protests against the fettering restrictions of mercantilism were
rooted in the needs of rising English industrialism. But it was precisely to
the economy of a free market that mechanical conceptions were relevant. In
the sovereign market, characterized by competitive individualism, free
contract and complete mobility of factors, and subject to no important
changes over time, the physical concepts of force, equilibrium, action and
reaction had their analogues. Orderliness was generated through the "nicely
adjusted mechanism of nature," without design or conscious control, precisely
as it seemed to be in the cosmos. It was, then, at a time when the
practical requirements of British industrialism, and the ideas of economic
liberalism were leading to the removal of market restrictions, that the
architecture of a science appropriate to the free market was suggested by
Newtonian mechanics. Out of this conjuncture came a dominant tradition
in our discipline.

The body of economic thought defining the play of forces in a free market,
and illuminating the extraordinary order-creating qualities of such a
market, is one of the great constructs of the human mind. It enabled men to
perceive, beneath the apparent chaos and bewildering complexity of observable
economic activities, the working of a vast cooperative scheme by which
the diverse needs of millions of individuals were satisfied. The analogy that
lay behind this construct was never perfect, it is true. There was never complete
concordance between the thought systems of classical economics and
the real world-a fact of which the framers of these systems were fully
aware. For the completely free market was never achieved; the world of economic
events was always marked by a diversity of frictions and retardations.
The equilibrium, in Edgeworth's phrase, was that of the surface of the sea,
a sluggish sea with viscous wave. The laws of formal theory represented
conditions at the limit, not those open to actual observation. Change over
time, too, lay outside the realm of a mechanistically conceived economics
with its static models, but if it could be believed that the institutional development
had found its terminus, that the framework would, in its essentials,
change no more, this was not a serious limitation.
Of course, mechanistic concepts have not prevailed in unsullied form, or
to the exclusion of other ideas. A literary and humanistic tradition has


### ---Economics-1941-0-06.txt---
persisted. Ideas of organic growth and evolutionary change influenced the
thinking of Ricardo, Malthus and many later economists. Marshall stressed
continuity of development, explicitly recognized the role of time in economic
adjustments, and made much use of biological analogies. John R.
Commons, examining the legal foundations of capitalism, and J. M. Clark,
studying the instrumentalities of social control, depart widely from simple
mechanism. With the passing years a variety of elements has been incorporated
into what was once a simple and elegant body of doctrine. But
at the foundation of formal economic theory, today, there still stand concepts
of static equilibrium, of a universe of balanced forces, of a fixed and
essentially unchanging order.
The general acceptance of the concepts we have been discussing rested
in part on faith in the expected progressive removal of vestigial frictions. A
nineteenth-century observer could well believe that the nations of the
world were on the way to closer economic resemblance and greater international
unity. The free market was spreading. Coupled with an international
gold standard it promised to dominate economic activities throughout
the world. The actual movement, however, has been in the other direction.
For economics, perhaps the outstanding fact of the fifty years that
have elapsed since the publication of Marshall's Principles is that observed
discrepancies between objective reality and conceptual schemes based on the
assumption of market freedom have been intensified, not lessened. There
may be grounds for doubting this if we look at our own country alone.
There can be none if we take a world view. Less and less does the sovereign
market of economic theory accord with the actual market in which goods
and services are exchanged. Today, faith in the free market as the mechanism
through which economic activities may be regulated and economic
order achieved in a world of conflicting needs and aims has been sorely
shaken. Neither at home nor in our international relations do we rely upon
the uncontrolled market to allocate resources or to effect other necessary
economic adjustments.
It is a decisive fact for our generation, and one that is crucial for economic
thought, that we may not look to the arbitrament of the market for
the full adjustment of means to ends, and for the unplanned solution of
the economic problem. This is not to say that automatism has been completely
replaced, or that we have today either the knowledge or the administrative
power which would provide us with substitutes capable of
performing all its innumerable and intricate functions. Vast numbers of
adjustments are still effected through the operations of free or only partially
regulated forces. But over large areas of the western world the major adaptations
of economic means to conflicting possible ends, the major decisions
concerning uses to be made of limited resources, are not made through the
free inter-play of market forces. And even in our own economy, control and


### ---Economics-1941-0-07.txt---
regulation have in recent years trenched deeply upon the areas of free
action. There may be a return, but he would be a rash man who would set
a time for it.

In stressing the mechanistic background of certain of the concepts that
have been employed in the study of the market, I have not meant to imply
that sheer mechanism plays an important role in contemporary theory. In
its obvious form it does not. We have been slow, however, to shake off
elements that derive from the static character of these antecedents. The
notion of a fixed order of things is still deeply imbedded in formal economics.
But the outstanding fact of economic life is change, change in the
institutional framework and change in the working elements of our economic
system. To recognize this is one thing. To, take adequate account of
it in seeking to interpret economic events, to incorporate the contingent
and the uncertain into our concepts, is yet another. This is one of the tasks
that confront our generation of economists.
This brief summary has dealt with facts that are largely familiar, but
they are facts that cannot be ignored in any review of the problems before
economists today. It must be a matter of major concern to us that there
exists a cleavage between the observed facts of economic life and the
formal systems of thought wherewith we seek to interpret and unify these
observations. Descriptive, piecemeal accounts of institutions and activities
and their shifting forms we have, in number. Perhaps the distinctive contribution
of our time has been the development of specialized bodies of
knowledge and specialized instruments of economic intelligence. We know
far more about national income, the structure of credit, industrial piroductivity,
the formation of capital, the earnings of labor, than we did fifty
years ago. But the circle completes itself. Variety in detail cries again for
simplifying principles. Conceptual systems that would interrelate these
diverse facts and their changes over time, systems with the sweep, generality
and apparent unifying power that were the impressive features of classical
economics in the heyday of its acceptance we have not. Which is another way
of saying that understanding has not kept pace with observation. Intellectual
discomfort is a natural result.
I would not suggest that in a universe of variation and discontinuous
change we may hope to create theoretical systems that are at once allembracing
and completely consistent with the perceptual world. In limited
areas and for limited times agreement between concepts and apparent
reality may be close, but disturbing discrepancies will persist. Driven to
seek understanding of complex phenomena, we shall continue to construct
simplifying and unifying systems; driven to make these constructs accord
with shifting and diverse reality, and unable to do so, we shall continue
to damn our systems as formalistic figments. That better analytical tools
will be forged and that fuller understanding will emerge from this troubled


### ---Economics-1941-0-08.txt---
state is not to be doubted. But we can be equally sure that the gap between
objective and attainment will remain, to exasperate, torment and stimulate
us and our successors. Our reach will continue to exceed our grasp, and
economists will still have need of Heaven.
There is yet another factor in our current discomfort. Economics deals,
of course, with human needs. But in a very special sense the things that men
desire-amelioration of present troubles, social and economic reconstruction-
touch the everyday work of the economist as they do not touch the
laboratory of the physical scientist. Influences of this sort, relating to ends
and ultimate values, are always felt in our discipline, but they are made to
press more insistently upon us by the difficulties of the day, and by our
present fearful concern with political and social emergencies. Looking
abroad, we have seen the purposes and values of special groups imposed on
scholars, and the resources of science used to buttress party dogmas. At
home, the ideal of objective research has been questioned. With freedom of
thought forcibly denied to our co-workers abroad, with doubt expressed
in our own circles as to the possibility and the desirability of scientific
detachment, and with the urgencies of the day beating upon us, we may not
put these issues aside.
The ideal of an objective science of economics, built on steadily expanding
knowledge of human nature, of social institutions and of industrial
organization, and divorced from personal judgments of the desirable and
the undesirable, has made its way slowly. For economics was long tied to
ethical creeds and conditioned by moral judgments. The escape to objectivity
was difficult, more difficult than for the physical sciences. The
subject matter of economics is the behavior of human beings; its laws deal
with human wants, and the pains of effort. It is not easy to disentangle
these intimately human affairs from personal judgments and individual
scales of value.

It has seemed obvious to men of many generations that the ends of human
existence and the objectives of social action are simple and inevitable truths.
Whether the end so clear to men was to glorify a deity, to achieve the simple
and natural order of liberty, to maximize the good of the greatest number,
to aggrandize a nation, or to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat,
norms for judgment of the "rightness" or "wrongness" of conditions or
policies were ready to hand. The notion that one could thus simply and
finally judge ends and appraise means sharply limited the scope of social
thinking. Confidence in a fixed system of ultimate values restricted the
hypotheses open to study, and cramped the investigator in the exploration
of social forms.

I do not attempt to trace the growth of the ideal of an objective science
of economics, independent of ethical creeds and moral philosophy. There
are elements of it in eighteenth-century thought, entangled with Physiocratic


### ---Economics-1941-0-09.txt---
doctrine and ideas of natural law. The Wealth of Nations, though
written as a powerful and purposeful tract, contains an account of a
national economy as an ordered system of mass coLpperation. There was an
attempt here to find correspondence between the chaotic diversity of senseexperience
and a logically uniform system of thought-and this, it has
been said, is the essence of science. With ebbs and flows the ideal and
the practice of objective economic study gained ground in the nineteenth
century. The vitality of economic thought in England and the United
States in the last quarter of that century, after a depressing decline in the
sixties and seventies must be credited at least in part to the stimulus of
this ideal.

It was natural to assume that the twentieth century would see a continuation
of this movement and a confirmation of this ideal. The improvement
of quantitative methods, the elabo;ration of techniques of impersonal
analysis, seemed to promise greater objectivity, a more rapid building of a
factual basis for economics. In academic, business, and governmental centers
more men were grappling with economic problems. Research funds
undreamed of by the economists of the nineteenth century could be drawn
upon.

The contributions resulting from this expansion of personnel and of
resources have been substantial. The problems we face may be more acute
than those of an earlier day, our confidence in sweeping systems of thought
may be weaker, we may be more keenly aware of the lack of generality
and prediction value in our conclusions. But we do possess, I believe, sharper
analytical tools and knowledge of the details of economic life that is at once
more comprehensive and more accurate. The technical and factual foundations
of systematic economic knowledge are being extended and made
stronger every day. Despite these gains the ideal of objectivity in economics
is disputed today. Faced with the pressing problems of a world in
turmoil, many have lost confidence in the possibility of our building an
objective science, divorced from the predilections and emotions of individual
investigators.

It is to be expected that the dominant attitude in totalitarian states would
be in conflict with the ideal of a science of economics not bound up with
the ends of the state. Sombart, who typifies this attitude, rejects, for our
discipline, the reasoning processes of the natural sciences and the concept
of law prevailing in those sciences. He insists that the laws of economics
have a priori validity, and are derived directly and intuitively. To him
economic laws stand at the beginning, not at the end of research. The
laws and values thus intuitively derived have the attributes of necessity.
They shape and direct the material subject matter of economics.' This particular
formulation is new, but the design was outlined in the last century.

Not first among its architects, but a dominant figure, was Adolf Wagner.
Seventy years ago Wagner set a pattern for economic thought completely
subordinated to the ends of national power. (I note, in passing, Wagner's
term for the attitude of those who were not guided by sound national
egoism. It was no mean achievement in the coupling of words to define
this reprehensible state of mind as "fanatical objectivity.")
If criticism of objectivity in the social sciences were confined to Sombart,
Wagner, and other advocates of the supreme state, it would perhaps carry
little weight with us. But men who speak with authority for the social
sciences and for scientific method, and whose interests and motives are not
o,pen to question, have recently challenged social scientists on this fundamental
issue. Charles A. Beard cites "the state of uncertainty and perplexity
reigning in the very midst of the so-called objective school" as proof
that "the old assumptions of absolute neutrality no longer satisfy the human
spirit." He believes that the idea of a value-free, objective social science is
an illusion. Julian Huxley notes "the entanglement of social science with
problems of value" and concludes that "to understand and describe a
system involving values is impossible without some judgment of values,
and still more impossible without such value-judgments is the other
scientific function, that of control." And Robert Lynd in his provocative
book Knowledge for What? deprecates the fact that the young social
sciences, "hiding behind their precocious beards of 'dispassionate research'
and 'scientific objectivity' are reluctant to accept full partnership with
man in the adventure of living."
There is an issue here that we may not lightly dismiss. The two extreme
positions may be briefly suggested. At one limit stands an "objectivity"
that is oblivious to ends, purposes, relative values, that puts all observations
on the same dead level of importance, or unimportance, that conceives the
work of the scientist to be done when he has investigated something, anything,
by tidily arranging all data that might bear on it. It is bloodless, cold,
dispassionate, and utterly meaningless. At the other limit, every scholar uses
his own yardstick of relative values. These values lie beyond all testing
and questioning, but they furnish, for the individual to whom they have
been revealed, the ultimate touchstone. All judgments of means are based
on these values. Research is an individual adventure.
Of course, neither of these extreme alternatives is acceptable. One means,
for the economist, a withdrawal from life, acquiescence in whatever is,
complete indifference to the meaning of the forms he is studying, or of
alternative forms of economic organization. The other means the loss of a
hard-won heritage, renunciation of the hope of cumulative growth of
economic knowledge, surrender to rudderless whims and the unpredictable
diversities of individual taste. Our problem as economists is the difficult one
of serving our generation in meeting its urgent present needs and of preserving


### ---Economics-1941-0-11.txt---
all our rights to objective, detailed appraisal, with nothing, whether
end or means, exempt from critical judgment.
The key to this apparent dilemma is to be found, I think, in the manner
in which values are to be treated. The moralist, the reformer, the protagonist
of causes, usually derives his values from without the system of facts and
events to which the values are to be applied, and for which they provide
ends. For Adolf Wagner values were set by national honor and national
interest. For Sombart values and judgments about values derive from the
individual's Weltanschauung. They lie outside the realm of science; they
are not subject to testing, to critical judgment. Values thus derived have, I
think, no place in the work of the economist. In this direction lie emotionalism,
partisanship, conflict, and the loss of that impartiality toward
facts, in the realm of knowledge, that is the richest heritage of our scientific
tradition. If the revolt against detachment and objectivity means the subordination
of the quest for knowledge to values and objectives that are
beyond testing, it threatens the very essentials of our discipline.
I do not believe that a science can assume responsibility for choosing
among ends, and for setting up scales of preference in its discussion of the
objectives of social action, without introducing into systems of thought the
support of given ends. This is not to deprecate the maintenance of rights to
personal choice or the espousal of causes by individuals, be they poets, politicians,
pedagogues or political economists. The human spirit is at its finest
in the selfless support of great causes. But the heart of science, as a method
of observation, a means to understanding, and an attitude toward the
universe, is lost when science itself becomes a protagonist of ends. This
assertion has, I believe, a timeless validity. It is not conditioned by the
affairs of the moment. There is today, however, more reason than in normal
times for a jealous preservation by economists of the independence and
objectivity that are the heart of the scientific tradition. To forsake that
tradition is to invite political control. It is to make of economics a discipline
subservient to the dominant political powers of the day.
In thus repudiating protagonism and partisanship I am far from proposing
that we close our eyes to values and value judgments. We need not and
must not be blind accumulators of knowledge irrelevant to social needs and
aims. Values and ends concern us mightily. Our attitude toward them,
however, is not that of the preacher of ethics or the social reformer. They
are part of the subject matter of inquiry, open to criticism, appraisal, provisional
acceptance or rejection.2 For any value judgment, any setting up of
an objective of social action, is a hypothesis. Like all hypotheses it suggests
modes of organization,. ways of utilizing things, methods of handling
the means that are open to manipulation. We should be both blind and


### ---Economics-1941-0-12.txt---
remiss if we failed to explore leads to various forms of organization alternative
to the one that may exist at a given time, to use alternative models
as aids in the examination of existing institutions. It is the function of
ideas concerning ends and ultimate values to suggest the nature of such
alternative methods of utilizing resources and satisfying wants. These
alternatives are then subject to examination in which all the interrelations of
means to ends and of ends to means are explored. And this exploration is
a task in which complete detachment and full objectivity are essential elements.
It is not a task for the impassioned protagonist. Anguish and art,
says Irwin Edman, are not identical. Neither, I may add (and my jagged
meters perhaps accord with my subject), neither are emotional perturbation
and political economy identical.
In defending the necessity of objectivity in economic research, I have
spoken in abstract terms. Yet here, too, means and ends may not be dissociated.
Impartiality and independence have a further sanction in that
they contribute directly to the fruitfulness of research and the extension of
knowledge. The data of economic research today are in many repositoriesthe
files of industrial corporations, the books of banks and public utilities,
the records of organized labor, the documents of accountants, the archives of
government. Economics can be given life and substance if it can draw on all
these sources for the facts on which it must build. These sources are open
to us only when there is mutual confidence in the possibility of disinterested
study. We have before us today many examples of co65peration, in research,
of individuals of diverse economic interests and, indeed, of widely
differing opinions as to what is desirable in economic organization. Make
research a tool of special interests, make the driving motive the attainment
of my particular Utopia, or yours, reject objectivity and impartial workmanship
as the means to advance knowledge, and the possibility of such
co6peration is lost.
My talk tonight has been shop talk. I have discussed some of the elements
of uncertainty in our discipline today, some of the difficulties we face in
seeking a better understanding of the means by which men live. The mere
variation of experience creates some of these difficulties. The confusions
and needs of a troubled time have put phenomena, in all their diversity,
at the center of economic attention. Satisfaction with the unity and logical
coherence of systems of economic thought is to some extent impaired when
the bewildering variety of things and events is set against these conceptual
systems.

Difficulties growing out of a keener appreciation of the complexities of
economic reality have been. intensified by profound and accelerated change.
I mean, now, not changes on the intellectual level, such as those that revolutionized
biological thought eighty years ago, or those that recast the foundations
of the physical sciences in the early years of this century. These


### ---Economics-1941-0-13.txt---
changes germinated and spread in the realm of ideas. They altered the
intellectual climate, but the basic phenomena of biology and physics were
unaffected. The revolutions of our generation fall on another front. The
tides of change that have flowed during the last twenty-five years, and that
have reached flood proportions in the past decade, strike deeply at social
institutions. The ordinary affairs of life are affected for men everywhere,
as they have not been for centuries. Economics and the other social sciences
lie in the direct track of the cyclonic disturbances of our time. Not only are
conditions of inquiry and systems of ideas affected. The structure of social
life is being modified; the patterns of temporal change in social life, to
which we have in some degree adapted ourselves, have been altered. Profound
changes have occurred in the subject matter of research itself. It is
not surprising that understanding has lagged.
One aspect of these changes has special significance for us. The concept
of a free market occupies a central place in economic thought. Complete
freedom has never been achieved, it is true; but a system of thought based
on the assumption that such freedom exists had strong claims when it
could be believed that obstacles to freedom were being steadily reduced.
From a world view this is clearly not so today, nor are there reasons to
believe that it will be so in the piroximate future. With decline in the free
market and the persistence of other fundamental changes, mechanistically
based concepts lose much in relevance. We are struggling toward alternative
concepts adapted to our needs in seeking to understand the complex of free,
controlled and regulated elements in contemporary economies as they
change over time, but our constructs still fall short of our needs.
I have touched, finally, on the possibility of impartial and unbiased
research under the conditions of social disturbance and conflict that prevail
today. Economists may have erred at times in the naive belief that description
of an existing system is the whole of their scientific task. The counterswing
that leads to rejection of objectivity and deliberate advocacy of
particular ends is, I have suggested, equally dangerous. Neither promises
most effectively to promote the accumulation of a body of knowledge
relevant to the urgent needs of the day. I believe that we can deal objectively
with both means and ends, that we can bring into our inquiries value
judgments and opinions as to the ends of social action-even widely differing
judgments and opinions-without becoming partisans and protagonists.
Promise 'for our science lies in this direction.
Under the conditions prevailing in the world today American economists
face heavy responsibilities. The task of keeping a body of knowledge alive,
of maintaining the right of economists to deal obijectively with facts, means
and ends is primary among these, as a continuing duty. This task cannot
be performed by our colleagues on the continent of Europie. Here, where
inquiry can still be free, free of class, race or nationalistic bias, free of


### ---Economics-1941-0-14.txt---
ends imposed from without, the obligation to maintain conditions of free
research and to harvest the fruits of free research is a grave and sobering
one.

Immediately pressing is a responsibility to help meet the urgent needs
of our day and our country. For this we require systematized knowledge of
the operating characteristics of the economic system we now possess, with
its puzzling and varying combination of free and restricted elements. When
the resources, the mechanisms, the potentialities of both the human and
material elements of this system are known, with a detail anld accuracy far
exceeding that whidc we possess today, we shall have information about
means that will make us better able intelligently to appraise ends, and to
hold ends and means in just balance. The achievement of understanding
of our present economic system is our most pressing and most immediate
obligation.

In speaking of the appraisal of ends I point to a second requirement.
This is complete open-mindedness in the study of our existing economic
organization and of alternative economic arrangements. Out of this world
crisis will come further change. We cannot now define the course of this
change, or the design of the economic life that is to follow. If we may not,
as economists, support this or that proposal for reconstruction, we should
be ready to test any hypothesis, to appraise any proposal for modes of
organization and methods of operation alternative to those we now possess,
whether these proposals involve major or minor changes in economic life
as we know it. No hypothesis can be ruled out, per se. And no hypothesis
can be exempt from the most rigorous testing against our given economic
means.

The two great responsibilities with which each of us is charged todayto
our continuing discipline and to the urgencies of time and place-can
best be met by the economist who serves as economist, not as defender,
advocate, disciple, or special pleader. Such impartial service is the greatest
contribution he can make to the needs of an age in crisis. I believe that
he may best hope to make that contribution if he continues to live and
work in the great tradition of western science, a tradition that means honesty
of endeavor, integrity and dignity of spirit, and the ideal of objectivity in
research.
