understand the theoretieal and praetieal eonelusions
reaellecl by that philosophy. The problem wllieh presented
itself to our forefathers, and to Freneh statesmen,
as well as to English thinkers, was essentially negative.
Restrietions onust be removed. Favoritism onust be
abolished, and the laws making possible restrietions and
favoritism must be repealed. The restrietions upon
liberty svllieh nvere then llotieecl ssZere restrietions of a
politieal nature. Consequently the problem of liberty
was eoneeived to be essentially a politieal problem, as
well as a negative one.

Closely assoeiated witl-l this cloetrille of equality was
the doetrille of the bellefieellee of self-interest. Inaslnuell
as men were essentially equal, eaell one eoulcl best
gElarCl his own interests individually, provided only the
halllperillg fetters of the law sholllc1 maiSe way for a
reign of liberty. Time does not permit me to follow
out, as I would like, the development of this negative
view of liberty, wlliell I have presented. From it we
may traee out a very elearly onarked line of evolution of
thought, and a solIlewhat less elearly marked line of
evolution of politieal praetiee. Through various
writers we reaeh Herbert Speneer's treatment of liberty
as a negative allci politieal problem. The areat elleony
of freedoon, he holds, is the state manifesting itself in
laws clireeting Iluman aetisTity, and in his opinion, leading
inevitably to slavery, unless the flow of legislation
is in some way eheeked. We find Herbert Speneer
preaehing his doetrine of liberty in his " Soeial Staties "
in I85I, and asserting in it the right of man to disregard
me state, and ila more reeent times he expounds his
doetrine in artieles bearing sueh titles as these: "The
Coming Slavery ", " The Sins of Legislators ", " The
Great Political Superstition."
