Economic science is an outgrowtll of economic conditions.
It is a product of social unrest. From the earliest
discussions of classical antiquity. from the first faint
glimmer of truth in uledixval speculatiola, from the elaboration
of complete systems of thought in the eighteenth
century, down to the recent renaissance of scientific enquiry
in the western hetnisphere, each step forward in
economic analysis has been the result of azz attempt to
unravel the tangled skein of actual conditions, and of an
effort to solve the difficultie.s of the existing industrial
society. Consciously or unconsciously the teleological
element has presided at the birth atld has accompanied
the Crowth of all social speculation. " What ought to
be " has ever been the spiritual father of " what is."
It is not inteIlded, of course, to deny the existeIlce of
the independent search -for truth for its own sake. On
the contrary, in economics, as in every other scientific
discipline, the highest flights of the intellect have been
in the tenuous and serene attnosphere of pure reason, far
above the tllrbid waves and windy surface of every day
discussion. It would in belloove the president of an association
like this to say aught in disparagement of the
fearless and unselfish quest for truth for its own sake.

tidal wave of mere brutal bigness which threatens to engulf
us all, nothing is more needed than to cling to the
