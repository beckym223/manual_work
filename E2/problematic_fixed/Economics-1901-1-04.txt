If other European eolllltries have not as yet given as
distinet al] endorsement to the vie-v that ulliversites
should undertake this fl1l1etioll, it is largely beeallse of
the existenee il] those eoulltries of eertaill high bracle
eolnInereial colleges, whieh satisfy the cielllaIld fairly
well, and beeause of the heavy-footed gate of their universities
in general when any illnovavion is proposed.
With 1ls, on the eontrary, eireumstallees are dif:erent.
OI1 the one hand we llad and have no separate eomlllereial
sehools of high rank; that is, of college or university
grade; and on the other, Olll- colleges and universities
are in a position to respond more quiekll to speeial
public oleecls thal] those of Europe. Olla system of
higher edlleatioll has many defeets, but one of its advantages
lies in its elose toueh with the eomll-lon life of
the people. Tlli.s acts in sozne waTs as a llilldrallee,
sinee it tell(is to lceep the intelleetual level of the institution
near that of the averabe ol; the eomo-nullity; and
this .sometimes means near to a clead level of meclioerity.
Bllt the scheme has at any rate the virtue of its clefeets.
The steatly and eontinlled dependenee upon the public
for funcxs makes these institutions qlliekly responsive
to tTle real needs of the eomluunity. Our device
of governing boards --non-expert boclieEs of business and
professional <lenrellclers this eontaet between the peoZ
ple and higher institutions all the easier and more
vital, and through these boards responsible directly or
indirectly for tlhe funds necessary to keep the institutions
going-tile life blood of the community CAll pulsate
into the very arteries of college and university life;
thus, to some extent, preventing that stiffeninC and
exclusiveness, that Pl-lariseeisrn, which is t]le ever present
danger of all higher institutions of learning, and
especially of those which are self-governing bodies.
