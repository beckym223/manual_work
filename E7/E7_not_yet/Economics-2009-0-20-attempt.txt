inventions, most notably the primus stove. He spent several months in Norway thinking and
planning, and kept improving his equipment and methods during the previous winter's sojourn
at his base camp in Antarctica. Scott, by contrast, relied on his own ideas and a belief that every?
thing British, and specifically everything previously done by the British navy, was the best. The
results were starkly different. Amundsen won the race by a big margin; his sledging round-trip
record of 99 days still stands. Scott and his companions were delayed by their inadequate skills
and equipment. Because of the delay, they were caught in the cold of the late autumn on the way
back, and perished. (See Roland Huntford 1979.10) My advice to designers and reformers of insti?
tutions and policies is: be like Amundsen, not like Scott.
10 Scott has his defenders In particular, Susan Solomon (2001) has argued that Scott was merely unlucky he was  caught in exceptionally cold weather on his return journey She shows that Scott had access to temperature data for  three previous seasons, and made his preparations assuming the average But this is hardly good decision-making  under uncertainty in a matter of life and death Also, bad weather in March 1912 does not explain why he lost the race  so badly in December 1911
