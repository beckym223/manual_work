Or1 the other hand, a man's theory of prosperity is
closely interwoven with his theories of ethics and of
politics. Moral and political standards are a determining
element in our judgtnent as to whether a nation's
aggregate condition is good or bad. Observation as to
the effect of diflerent industrial systeIns on the stability
or destruction of a nation reacts, in turn, upon our
moral and political judgments. It is at tl-lis point that
the interaction between economics and politics, whether
by way of ulutual aid or mutual criticism, is ollOSt conSta
11t. OI11Y occasionally and incidentally do our
theories of distribution lead lIS to intervene in political
aHairs by showing that certain lines of legislation produce
different results from those which are contemplated.
Daily and hourly does our theory of prosperity lead us
to such intervention, when we believe that the aitns of
a certain group of moralists or politicians are destructive
to the well-being of the nation as a whole.
At this point, where the possibility of influence is
greatest, the difficulty which meets the economist who
strives to maintain a dispassionate and critical attitude is
also keenest. In his theory of distributiola he can
readily remain a passive observer of facts. He can
measure and weigh the results of coznpetition, as he can
measure and weigh the results of gravitation or of bioX
logical selection; and can guard himself against error
in fact or deduction by the sall-le methods which are
used by the physicist or the biologist for the same purpose.
Bllt when he comes to measure the aggregate
merit of the total result, he has a different task and a
far harder one.

I said a year ago, and I still believe, that even in this
task the scientific knowledge possessed by the economist
enables him to cotne nearer to its fulfillment than can
