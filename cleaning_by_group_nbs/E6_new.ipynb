       " 'Adam Smith, who has strong claim to\\nbeing both the Adam and the Smith of\\nsystematic economics, was a professor of\\nmoral philosophy and it was at that forge\\nthat economics was made. Even when I\\nwas a student, economics was still part of\\nthe moral sciences tripos at Cambridge\\nUniversity. It can claim to be a moral sci-\\nence, therefore, from its origin, if for no\\nother reason. Nevertheless, for many\\neconomists the very term \"moral science\"\\nwill seem like a contradiction. We are\\nstrongly imbued today with the view that\\nscience should be wertfrei and we believe\\nthat science has achieved its triumph pre-\\ncisely because it has escaped the swad-\\ndling clothes of moral judgment and has\\nonly been able to take off into the vast\\nuniverse of the \"is\" by escaping from the\\ntreacherous launching pad of the \"ought.\"\\nEven economics, we learn in the history of\\nthought, only became a science by escap-\\ning from the casuistry and moralizing of\\nmedieval thought. Who, indeed, would\\nwant to exchange the delicate rationality\\nof the theory of equilibrium price, for the\\nunoperational vaporings of a \"just price\"\\ncontroversy? In the battle between mech-\\nanism and moralism generally mechanism\\nhas won hands down, and I shall not be\\nsurprised if the very title of my address\\ndoes not arouse musty fears of sermoniz-\\ning in the minds of many of my listeners.\\nLet me first explain, then, what I mean\\nby moral and by moral science. A moral,\\nor ethical proposition, is a statement\\nabout a rank order of preference among\\nalternatives, which is intended to apply to\\nmore than one person. A preference which\\napplies to one person only is a \"taste.\"\\nStatements of this kind are often called\\n\"value judgments.\" If someone says, \"I\\nprefer A to B,\" this is a personal value\\njudgment, or a taste. If he says, \"A is bet-\\nter than B,\" there is an implication that\\nhe expects other people to prefer A to B\\nalso, as well as himself. A moral proposi-\\ntion then is a \"common value.\"\\nEvery culture, or subculture, is defined\\nby a set of common values, that is, gener-\\nally agreed upon preferences. Without a\\ncore of common values a culture cannot\\nexist, and we classify society into cultures\\nand subcultures precisely because it is\\npossible to identify groups who have com-\\nmon values.\\nMost tastes are in fact also common\\nvalues and have been learned by the pro-\\ncess by which all learning is done, that is,\\nby mutation and selection. The most ab-\\nsurd of all pieces of ancient wisdom is\\nsurely the Latin tag de gustibus non dis-\\nputandum. In fact, we spend most of our\\nlives disputing about tastes. If we want to\\nbe finicky about definitions we might turn\\nthe old tag around and say where there is\\ndisputing, we are not talking about tastes.\\nNevertheless, even personal tastes are\\nlearned, in the matrix of a culture or a\\nsubculture in which we grow up, by very\\nmuch the same kind of process by which\\nwe learn our common values. Purely per-\\nsonal tastes, indeed, can only survive in a\\nculture which tolerates them, that is,\\nwhich has a common value that private\\ntastes of certain kinds should be allowed.\\nOne of the most peculiar illusions of\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'economists is a doctrine that might be\\ncalled the Immaculate Conception of the\\nIndifference Curve, that is, that tastes are\\nsimply given, and that we cannot inquire\\ninto the process by which they are\\nformed. This doctrine is literally \"for the\\nbirds,\" whose tastes are largely created\\nfor them by their genetic structures, and\\ncan therefore be treated as a constant in\\nthe dynamics of bird societies. In human\\nsociety, however, the genetic component\\nof tastes is very small indeed. We start off\\nwith a liking for milk, warmth, and dry-\\nness and a dislike for being hungry, cold,\\nand wet, and we do have certain latent\\ndrives which may guide the formation of\\nlater preferences in matters of sex, occu-\\npation, or politics, but by far and away\\nthe largest part of human preferences are\\nlearned, again by means of a mutation-se-\\nlection process. It was, incidentally, Veb-\\nlen\\'s principal, and still largely unrecog-\\nnized, contribution to formal economic\\ntheory, to point out that we cannot as-\\nsume that tastes are given in any dynamic\\ntheory, in the sense that in dynamics we\\ncannot afford to neglect the processes by\\nwhich cultures are created and by which\\npreferences are learned.\\nI am prepared indeed to go much fur-\\nther and to say that no science of any\\nkind can be divorced from ethical consid-\\nerations, as defined above. The proposi-\\ntions of science are no more immaculately\\nconceived than the preferences of individ-\\nuals. Science is a human learning process\\nwlhich arises in certain subcultures in\\nhuman society and not in others, and a\\nsubculture as we have seen is a group of\\npeople defined by the acceptance of cer-\\ntain common values, that is, an ethic\\nwhich permits extensive communication\\namong them.\\nThe scientific subculture is no exception\\nto this rule. It is characterized by a strong\\ncommon value system. A high value, for\\ninstance, is placed on veracity, on curios-  ity, on measurement, on quantification, on\\ncareful observation and experiment, and\\non objectivity. Without this common\\nvalue structure the epistemological pro-\\ncess of science would not have arisen; in-\\ndeed it did not arise in certain societies\\nwhere conditions might otherwise have\\nbeen favorable but where some essential\\ncommon values of the scientific subcul-\\ntures did not exist. The question as to ex-\\nactly what values and ethical propositions\\nare essential to the scientific subculture\\nmay be in some dispute. The fact that\\nthere are such values cannot be disputed.\\nIt is indeed one of the most perplexing\\nquestions in intellectual history as to why\\nthe scientific subculture developed in the\\ntime and place that it did in Western Eu-\\nrope. The common values that are prereq-\\nuisite to it are rather rare among human\\nsubcultures. The common values, for in-\\nstance, of the military or the people that\\nrun the international system are quite dif-\\nferent from those of science. In this sense,\\ntherefore, science has an essential ethical\\nbasis.\\nThis means that even the epistemologi-\\ncal content of science, that is, what scien-\\ntists think they know, has an ethical com-\\nponent. The proposition, for instance, that\\nwater consists of two molecules of hydro-\\ngen and one of oxygen is not usually\\nthought of as a proposition with high ethi-\\ncal content. Nevertheless, any student in\\nchemistry who decides that he prefers to\\nthink of hydrogen as dephlogisticated\\nwater will soon find out that chemistry is\\nnot just a matter of personal taste. The\\nfact that there is no dispute going on\\nabout any particular scientific proposition\\ndoes not mean to say that it is a matter of\\ntaste; it simply means that the dispute\\nabout it has been resolved through the ap-\\nplication of certain common values and\\nethical presuppositions.\\nThere is however a fundamental sense\\nin which the epistemological process even\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'in the physical and biological sciences is\\nnow running into situations which have\\nstrong ethical implications outside the\\nscientific subculture. The myth that sci-\\nence is simply discovering knowledge\\nabout an objectively unchangeable world\\nmay have had some validity in the early\\nstages of science but as the sciences de-\\nvelop this myth becomes less and less\\nvalid. The learning process of science is\\nnow running into two serious difficulties.\\nThe first might be called the generalized\\nHeisenberg principle. When we are trying\\nto obtain knowledge about a system by\\nchanging its inputs and outputs of infor-\\nmation, these inputs and outputs will\\nchange the system itself, and under some\\ncircumstances they may change it radi-\\ncally. My favorite illustration of the Hei-\\nsenberg principle is that of a man who in-\\nquires through the door of the bedroom\\nwhere his friend is sick, \"How are you?\"\\nwhereupon the friend replies \"Fine,\" and\\nthe effort kills him. In the social sciences\\nof course the generalized Heisenberg prin-\\nciple predominates because knowledge of\\nthe social sciences is an essential part of\\nthe social system itself, hence objectivity\\nin the sense of investigating a world which\\nis unchanged by the investigation of it is\\nan absurdity.\\nThe second difficulty is that as science\\ndevelops it no longer merely investigates\\nthe world; it creates the world which it is\\ninvestigating. We see this even in the\\nphysical sciences where the evolution of\\nthe elements has now been resumed in this\\npart of the universe after some six billion\\nyears. We are increasingly going to see\\nthis in the biological sciences, which will\\nonly find out about the evolutionary pro-\\ncess by actively engaging in it, and chang-\\ning its course. In the social sciences one\\ncan defend the proposition that most of\\nwhat we can really know is what we cre-\\nate ourselves and that prediction in social\\nsystems can be achieved only by setting\\nup consciously created systems which will\\nmake the predictions come true. Knowl-\\nedge of random systems can only be ob-\\ntained by destroying them, that is, by tak-\\ning the randomness out of them. There is\\na great deal of evidence, for instance, that\\nthe fluctuations of prices in organized\\ncommodity or secuirity markets are essen-\\ntially random in nature. All we can possi-\\nbly discover therefore by studying these\\nfluctuations is what bias there might be in\\nthe dice. If we want to predict the future\\nof prices in such a market we will have to\\ncontrol it, that is, we will have to set up a\\nsystem of counterspeculation which will\\nguarantee a given future course of prices.\\nThe gold standard is a primitive example\\nof such a system in which it is possible to\\npredict that the price of gold will lie\\nwithin the gold points as long as the sys-\\ntem remains intact. Similarly, we can pre-\\ndict the inside temperature of a house\\nwith an effective furnace and thermostat\\nmuch better than we can predict the\\noutside temperature simply because we\\ncontrol one and not the other.\\nWe cannot escape the proposition that\\nas science moves from pure knowledge to-\\nward control, that is, toward creating\\nwhat it knows, what it creates becomes a\\nproblem of ethical choice, and will depend\\nupon the common values of the societies\\nin which the scientific subculture is\\nembedded, as well as of the scientific sub-\\nculture. Under these circumstances sci-\\nence cannot proceed at all without at least\\nan implicit ethic, that is, a subculture with\\nappropriate common values. The problem\\nexists in theory even in what might be de-\\nscribed as the objective phase of science,\\nthat is, the phase in which it is simply in-\\nvestigating \"what is,\" because the ques-\\ntion of the conditions under which igno-\\nrance is bliss is not an empty one.

As long as sci-\\nence is investigating an unchanging world,\\nhowever, this problem does not become\\nacute, for if knowledge does not change\\nthe world, then all ignorance does for us is\\nto prevent us from satisfying our idle\\ncuriosity. When, however, knowledge\\nchanges the world the question of the con-\\ntent of the common values, both of the\\nsubculture which is producing knowledge\\nand of the total society in which that sub-\\nculture is embedded, becomes of acute im-\\nportance. Under these circumstances the\\nconcept of a value-free science is absurd,\\nfor the whole future of science may well\\nrest in our ability to resolve the ethical\\nconflicts which the growth of knowledge is\\nnow creating. Science could create an ethi-\\ncal dynamic which would bring it to an\\nend.\\nLet us return then to economics as a\\nmoral science, not merely in the sense in\\nwhich all science is \"affected with an ethi-\\ncal interest,\" but in the quite specific\\nsense of asking whether economics itself\\ncan be of assistance in resolving ethical\\ndisputes, especially those which arise out\\nof the continued increase of knowledge.\\nEconomics specializes in the study of\\nthat part of the total social system which\\nis organized through exchange and which\\ndeals with exchangeables. This to my\\nmind is a better definition of economics\\nthan those which define it as relating to\\nscarcity or allocation, for the allocation of\\nscarce resources is a universal problem\\nwhich applies to political decisions and\\npolitical structures through coercion,\\nthreat, and even to love and community,\\njust as it does to exchange. I have else-\\nwhere distinguished three groups of social\\norganizers which I have called the threat\\nsystem, the exchange system, and the inte-\\ngrative system. Economics clearly occu-\\npies the middle one of these three. It\\nedges over towards the integrative system  insofar as it has some jurisdiction over the\\nstudy of the system of one-way transfers\\nof exchangeables, which I have called the\\n\"cgrants economy,\" for the grant, or one-\\nway transfer, is a rough measure of an in-\\ntegrative relationship. On the other side,\\neconomics edges towards an area between\\nthe threat system and the exchange sys-\\ntem which might be described as the study\\nof strategy or bargaining.\\nTo complete the circle there is also an\\narea, between the threat system and the\\nintegrative system, of legitimated threat\\nwhich is the principal organizer of politi-\\ncal activity and the main subject matter\\nof political science. All these systems are\\nlinked together dynamically through the\\nprocess of human learning which is the\\nmain dynamic factor in all social systems.\\nPart of this learning process is the learn-\\ning of common values and moral choices,\\nwithout which no culture and no social\\nsystem is possible. The process by which\\nwe learn otr preference structures indeed\\nis a fundamental key to the total dynam-\\nics of society.\\nEconomics, as such, does not contribute\\nvery much to the formal study of human\\nlearning, though some philosophical econ-\\nomists like Frederick Hayek [4] have\\nmade some interesting contributions to\\nthis subject. Our main contribution as\\neconomists is in the description of what is\\nlearned; the preference functions which\\nembody what is learned in regard to\\nvalues, and the production functions\\nwhich describe the results of the learning\\nof technology. XVe may not have thought\\nmuch about the genetics of knowledge,\\nbut we have thought about its description,\\nand this is a contribution not to be de-\\nspised.\\nThus, economics suggests the proposi-\\ntion that actual choices depend not only\\non preferences but on opportunities, and\\nthat under some circumstances quite small\\nchanges in either preferences or opportu-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

It throws a good deal of light also\\non what might be called the evolutionary\\necology of ethical systems. Successful eth-\\nical systems tend to create subcultures,\\nand these subcultures tend to perpetuate\\nand propagate the ethical systems which\\ncreated them. This principle helps to ex-\\nplain the persistent division of mankind\\ninto sects, nations, and ideological groups.\\nIf we were to map the ethical preference\\nsystems of the individuals who comprise\\nmankind, we would not find a uniform\\ndistribution but we would find a very\\nsharp clustering into cultures and subcul-\\ntures with relatively empty spaces be-\\ntween the clusters. All the members of a\\nsingle sect, for instance, tend to think\\nrather alike in matters of ethical judg-\\nment and differentiate themselves sharply\\nfrom the ethical judgments of other sects.\\nIndividuals tend to be attracted to one or\\nanother of these clusters, leaving the so-\\ncial space between them relatively empty,\\nlike space between the stars. The reasons\\nfor this phenomenon lie deep in the dy-\\nnamics of the human learning process, for\\nour preferences are learned mainly from\\nthose with whom we have the most com-\\nmunication. This principle accounts for\\nthe perpetuation of such clusters, though\\nit does not necessarily account for their\\noriginal formation, which exhibits many\\npuzzling phenomena. The splitting of\\nthese clusters in a kind of mitosis is also\\nan important and very puzzling phenome-\\nnon. Once we realize, however, that these\\nare highly sensitive systems as economic\\nanalysis suggests, we can see how wide\\ndivergences might arise. Thus, the actual\\ndifference in preferences and even oppor-\\ntunities between, shall we say, the social-\\nist countries and the capitalist countries,\\nmay in fact be quite small, but this differ-\\nence is enough to produce a very wide\\ndifference in the choices made.\\nEconomics has made its own attempt to\\nsolve some of the problems involved in the\\nmoral judglnent in what we know as wel-\\nfare economics. I believe this attempt has\\nbeen a failure, though a reasonably glo-\\nrious one, and we should take a brief look\\nat it. Welfare economics attempts to ask\\nthe question \"What do we mean when we\\nsay that one state of a social system is\\nbetter than another in strictly economic\\nterms?\" The most celebrated answer\\ngiven is the Paretian optimum, which\\nstates in effect that Condition A of a so-\\ncial system is economically superior to\\nCondition B, if nobody feels worse off in\\nA than in B, and if at least one person\\nfeels better off. \"Better off\" or \"worse off\"\\nare measured of course by preferences, so\\nthat we could restate the condition as say-\\ning that State A is superior to State B if\\none or more persons prefer A and if no-\\nbody prefers B. If we permit internal re-\\ndistributions within the system, that is,\\ncompensation, the range of possible supe-\\nrior states is considerably broadened.\\nFrom this simple principle a wide range of\\napplications has been found possible in a\\nstirring intellectual drama which might\\nwell be subtitled \"Snow White (the fairest\\nof all) and the Seven Marginal Condi-\\ntions.\"\\nMany, if not most, economists accept\\nthe Paretian optimum as almost self-evi-\\ndent. Nevertheless, it rests on an ex-\\ntremely shaky foundation of ethical prop-\\nositions. The more one examines it, for in-\\nstance, the more clear it becomes that\\neconomists must be extraordinarily nice\\npeople even to have thought of such a\\nthing, for it implies that there is no malev-\\nolence anywhere in the system. It im-\\nplies, likewise, that there is no benevo-\\nlence, the niceness of economists not quite\\nextending as far as good will. It assumes\\nselfishness, that is, the independence of in-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The\\nplain fact is that our lives are dominated\\nby precisely this interdependence of utility\\nfunctions which the Paretian optimum\\ndenies. Selfishness, or indifference to the\\nwelfare of others, is a knife edge between\\nbenevolence on the one side and malevo-\\nlence on the other. It is something that is\\nvery rare. We may feel indifferent towards\\nthose whom we do not know, with whom\\nwe have no relationships of any kind, but\\ntowards those with whom we have rela-\\ntionships, even the frigid relationship of\\nexchange, we are apt to be either benevo-\\nlent or malevolent. We either rejoice when\\nthey rejoice, or we rejoice when they\\nmourn.\\nThe almost complete neglect by econo-\\nmists of the concepts of malevolence and\\nbenevolence cannot be explained by their\\ninability to handle these concepts with\\ntheir usual tools. There are no mathemati-\\ncal or conceptual difficulties involved in\\ninter-relating utility functions, provided\\nthat we note that it is the perceptions that\\nmatter [2]. The familiar tools of our\\ntrade, the indifference map, the Edge-\\nworth box, and so on, can easily be ex-\\npanded to include benevolence or malevo-\\nlence, and indeed without this expansion\\nmany phenomena, such as one-way trans-\\nfers, cannot be explained. Perhaps the\\nmain explanation of ouLr neglect of these\\nconcepts is the fact that we have concen-\\ntrated so heavily on exchange as the ob-\\nject of our study, and exchange frequently\\ntakes place under conditions of at least\\nrelative indifference or selfishness, though\\nI argue that there is a minimum degree of\\nbenevolence even in exchange without\\nwhich it cannot be legitimated and cannot\\noperate as a social organizer. We ex-\\nchange courtesies, smiles, the time of day\\nand so on with the clerk in the store, as\\nwell as exchanging money for commodi-\\nties. The amount of benevolence which ex-\\nchangers feel towards each other need not\\nbe large, but a certain minimum is essen-\\ntial. If exchangers begin to feel malevo-\\nlent toward each other exchange tends to\\nbreak down, or can only be legitimated\\nunder conditions of special ritual, such as\\nsilent trade or collective bargaining.\\nNevertheless, economists can perhaps\\nbe excused for abstracting from benevo-\\nlence and malevolence, simply because\\ntheir peculiar baby, which is exchange,\\ntends to be that social organizer which lies\\nbetween these two extremes, and which\\nproduces, if not selfishness, at least low\\nlevels of malevolence and benevolence.\\nThe threat system constantly tends to\\nprodu-ce malevolence simply because of\\nthe learning process which it engenders. A\\nthreatener may begin by feeling benevo-\\nlent toward the threatened-\"I am doing\\nthis for your own good\"-but threats al-\\nmost invariably tend to produce malevo-\\nlence on the part of the threatened to-\\nwards the threatener, and this is likely to\\nproduce a type of behavior which will in\\nturn produce malevolence on the part of\\nthe threatener towards the threatened.\\nThis can easily result in a cumulative pro-\\ncess of increasing malevolence which may\\nor may not reach some kind of equilib-\\nrium. The breakup of communities into\\nfactions and into internal strife frequently\\nfollows this pattern. At the other end of\\nthe scale, the integrative system tends to\\nproduce benevolence and those institu-\\ntions which are specialized in the integra-\\ntive system, such as the family, the\\nchurch, the lodge, the club, the aluimni as-\\nsociation, and so on, tend also to create\\nand organize benevolence, even beyond\\nthe circle of their members.

The major impact of economics on\\nethics, it can be argued, has come because\\nit has developed broad, aggregative con-\\ncepts of general welfare which are subject\\nto quantification. We can see this process\\ngoing right back to Adam Smith, where\\nthe idea of what we would today call per\\ncapita real income, as the principal mea-\\nsure of national well-being, has made a\\nprofound impact on subsequent thinking\\nand policy. The development of the con-\\ncept of a gross national product and its\\nvarious modifications and components as\\nstatistical measures of economic success,\\nlikewise, has had a great impact in creat-\\ning common values for the objectives of\\neconomic policy. Another, less fortunate,\\nexample of a measure which profoundly\\naffected economic policy was the develop-\\nment of the parity index by the Bureau of\\nAgricultural Economics in the United\\nStates Department of Agriculture. As a  measure of the terms of trade -of agricul.\\nture, this became an important symbol.\\n\"A hundred per cent of parity\" became\\nthe avowed goal of agricultural policy,\\neven though there is very little reason to\\nsuppose that the terms of trade of a given\\nhistoric period, in this case the period\\n1909-14, have any ultimate validity as\\nan ideal. Because of differing rates of\\nchange in productivity in different parts\\nof the economy, we should expect the\\nterms of trade of different sectors to\\nchange. If, for instance, productivity in\\nagriculture rises faster than in the rest of\\nthe economy, as it has done in the last\\nthirty years, we would expect the terms of\\ntrade of agriculture to \"worsen\" without\\nany worsening of the incomes of farmers,\\nand without any sense of social injustice.\\nEven though economic measurement\\nmay be abused, its effect on the formation\\nof moral judgments is great, and on the\\nwhole I believe beneficial. The whole idea\\nof cost-benefit analysis, for instance, in\\nterms of monetary units, say \"real\" dol-\\nlars of constant purchasing power, is of\\nenormous importance in the evaluation of\\nsocial choices and even of social institut-\\nions.

Two principal criticisms\\nhave been made of it, the first of which I\\nthink is probably not valid, and the sec-\\nond of which may be valid under limited\\ncircumstances. The criticism that I think\\nis not valid is that cost-benefit analyses in\\nparticular, or economic principles in gen-\\neral, imply selfish motivation and an in-\\nsensitivity to the larger issues of malevo-\\nlence, benevolence, the sense of commu-\\nnity and so on. It is quite true, as shown\\nabove, that economists have neglected the\\nproblem of malevolence and benevolence.\\nNevertheless, our attitudes towards others\\ncan be measured at least as well as we can\\nmeasure other preferences, either by some\\nprinciple of \"revealed preference\" or by\\ndirect questioning. It is entirely within the\\ncompetence of economics, for instance, to\\ndevelop a concept of the \"rate of benevo-\\nlence\" which is the quantity of exchange-\\nables, as measured in real dollars, which a\\nperson would be willing to sacrifice in\\norder to contemplate an increase of one\\nreal dollar in the welfare of another per-\\nson. If the rate of benevolence is zero, of\\ncourse, we have indifference or pure self-\\nishness; if the rate of benevolence is nega-\\ntive we have malevolence, in which case\\npeople need compensation in order to con-\\ntemplate without loss the increased wel-\\nfare of an enemy, or in reverse would be\\nwilling to damage themselves in order to\\ndamage another. The rate of malevolence\\nthen would be the amount in real dollars\\none would be prepared to damage one\\'s\\nself in order to damage another person to\\nthe extent of one dollar. These rates of\\nmalevolence incidentally are frequently\\nquite high. It apparently costs the United\\nStates about four dollars to do one dollar\\'s\\nworth of damage in Vietnam, in which\\ncase our rate of benevolence towards\\nNorth Vietnam is at least minus four. In\\ndetermining cost-benefit analysis we can\\neasily include rates of benevolence and\\nmalevolence, adding the benefits and sub-\\ntracting the costs to those toward whom\\nwe are benevolent, multiplied of course by\\nthe rate of benevolence, and subtracting\\nthe benefits and adding the costs, simi-\\nlarly modifed, to those towards whom we\\nare malevolent.\\nThe concept of a rate of benevolence, in-\\ncidentally, is at least a partial solution to\\nthe perplexing question of interpersonal\\ncomparisons of utility around which econ-\\nomists have been doing a ritual dance for\\nat least three generations. Any decision\\ninvolving other people obviously involves\\nthese interpersonal comparisons. They are\\nmade, of course, inside the mind of the de-\\ncision-maker and what his rates of benev-\\nolence or malevolence are likely to be is\\ndetermined by the whole social process in\\nwhich he is embedded. Surely something\\ncan be said about this. We are, for in-\\nstance, likely to be more benevolent to\\npeople who are going to vote for us and\\nperhaps malevolent to people who are\\ngoing to vote against us.

Religion, likewise, is an\\nessentially heroic enterprise, even though\\nthere is a strong streak of spiritual cost-\\nbenefit analysis in it. The enormous role\\nwhich religion has played in the history of\\nmankind, for good or ill, is based on the\\nappeal which it has to the sense of iden-\\ntity and the sense of the heroic even in or-\\ndinary people. \"Here I stand and I can do\\nno other\" said Luther; \"To give and not to\\ncount the cost, to labor and ask for no re-\\nward\" is the prayer of St. Francis. \"Do\\nyour own thing\" is the motto of our new\\nsecular Franciscans, the Hippies.

Though we are concerned here\\nwith the problem of social yield, we should\\nobviously include these private yield-ori-\\nented costs in the cost-base of our benefit-\\ncost ratio.\\nAnother large part of the progress-gen-\\nerating expenses is incurred by agencies\\nnot institutionally subjected to criteria of\\neconomic yield. The government-financed\\nR & D9 and that financed by other non-\\nprofit institutions belong here, and so does\\nalmost all of the cost of increased per\\ncapita education.10 This does not mean\\nthat the nonprofit institutions incurring\\nthese costs are under no political or quasi-\\npolitical\" pressure to keep costs down per\\nunit of service; what it does mean is that\\nthese costs create net income by definition,\\ni.e., that their net-income-creating prop-\\nerty does not depend on whether they\\ngenerate offsetting revenues. Nonprofit in-\\nstitutions, most prominently illustrated by\\ngovernments, but illustrated also by pri-\\nvate teaching organizations, can have def-\\ncits but these deficits are not usually\\nviewed as negative income such as would\\ncancel any part of the incomes created by\\nthe institutions. In the language of na-\\ntional accounting, the services of these in-\\nstitutions are valued at cost, though, when\\nappraising the worth of the services, any\\nindividual may find this valuation uncon-\\nvincing. In this regard such costs are\\ntreated differently from those of firms,\\ne.g., differently from that R & D compo-\\nnent which is financed by industry.\\'2 The\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

In a preliminary step let us do so,\\nbut before trying to appraise the merits\\nand deficiencies of this version of our ratio,\\nlet us take a look also at another way of\\ngoing about the matter.\\nWe may, alternatively, decide to include\\nin our cost-base the costs of nonprofit in-\\nstitutions along with those of the profit-\\nseeking ones and thus obtain a ratio based\\non all-inclusive costs. This ratio will, of\\ncourse, come out lower than the first.\\nWe must remember, however, that even\\nthe cost-base which we call \"all-inclusive\"\\nexcludes items which are interpreted here\\nnot as costs of progress-generating inputs\\nbut as expenditures influencing the ef-\\nfectiveness of such inputs.14 In the first\\nplace, we shall have to limit ourselves to\\nthe analysis of American data; hence the\\ncosts incurred abroad belong among those\\nautomatically excluded. Secondly, medical\\nexpenses, other health-related components\\nof the consumer budget, and types of\\npublic investment bearing on the effec-\\ntiveness of progress-generating inputs are\\nexcluded (netted out) even from our larger\\ncost-base because it is implied that these\\nexpenses become justified by the specific\\noutput which they buy, aside from their\\neffect on productivity-gains. The same is\\nnot \"automatically\" taken for granted for\\nany part of the input we define as progress-\\ngenerating. No part of that input is ex-\\ncluded from our larger cost-base, and while\\npart of it is excluded from our smaller\\nbase, we emphasize that both bases re-\\nquire attention in our analysis. Thereby we\\nleave a range open for personal (subjective)\\nvaluation of the contribution of progress-\\ngenerating inputs aside from their con-\\ntribution to measurable productivity\\ngains.\\nThe proposition suggests itself that the\\n\\n###',\n",

If we say, as we do when using our\\nall-inclusive cost-base, that productivity-\\nincreases cost us inter alia the inputs\\nneeded for increased per capita education,\\nthen we are implying that on the benefit-\\nside the bulk of this particular cost must\\nbe deducted from the productivity-in-\\ncreases. The reason is that a once-attained\\nhigher level of per capita education must\\nsubsequently be maintained to keep the\\nlevel of knowledge from becoming reduced.\\nIn this regard the characteristics of educa-\\ntion are different from those of R & D or\\nfrom those of the costs of changeovers.\\nWhat needs to be deducted on the bene-\\nfit-side is the \"bulk\" of the cost that had\\nbeen entered for education-not the entire\\ncost-because we are relating our magni-\\ntudes to output, and constancy per unit of\\nthe population means a gradual reduction\\nper unit of output. However, on reasonable\\nquantitative assumptions the \"discounted\\nvalue\" of the difference between these two\\ngrowth rates is small, and hence I will\\nindeed deduct the bulk.27\\n2.

To the extent that these\\nassumptions are unrealistic our analysis\\nneeds to be adjusted, and in Section III, I\\nhave already pointed out that one type of\\nadjustment does not change the conclu-\\nsions very much. What should we think of\\nthe \"disembodiment\" implication of our\\nframework, i.e., of the implication that\\nprogress leads inter alia to the production\\nof new types of goods rather than depends\\non new equipment?\\nModels of so-called embodied progress do\\nnot seem convincing to me on logical\\ngrounds, and to my knowledge, no claim of\\nempirical superiority has been made, let\\nalone established, for these frameworks. As\\nI said, all progress is necessarily disem-\\nbodied in the sense that new ideas must\\nalways be put into effect with reliance on\\nthe initially given resources. This is an\\nessential constraint under which all econo-\\nmies operate. Improved production with\\nthe initially given resources then leads to\\nmore and better capital goods-hence to\\nthe replacement of old with superior equip-\\nment and structures (\"obsolescence\")-\\nand it yields more and better consumer\\ngoods. But all this represents forward, not\\nbackward, embodiment.\\nFor various purposes it has proved re-\\nwarding to interpret progress as \"factor-\\naugmenting\"; yet even if progress is inter-\\npreted as purely capital-augmenting, this\\nalone does not change the framework into\\none of embodied progress. Using a frame-\\nwork in which some input is \"augmented\"\\nmerely means expressing the productivity-\\nincrease of that input as the equivalent of a\\nspecific quantity-increase and expressing\\nthe productivity-increases of other inputs\\nas resulting from complementarity. No\\nempirical superiority has been claimed for\\nthis degree of unilateral emphasis on\\ncapital-i.e., for assuming pure capital-\\naugmentation-but at any rate more is\\nneeded for obtaining \"embodiment,\" in a\\ndistinctive sense of the term.\\nIf the embodiment hypothesis is not to\\nlose what I consider its essential charac-\\nteristic, the additional assumption must be\\nmade that each period\\'s capital-goods\\noutput can become subject merely to a\\nsingle dose of augmentation which de-\\nscribes a specific level of technology; and\\nthat only the next period\\'s capital goods-\\nthe next vintage-can become subject to\\nthe next dose. This, I submit, is an un-\\nconvincing assumption if we take into\\naccount why next period\\'s capital goods-\\nnext period\\'s equipment-models-are su-\\nperior to this period\\'s equipment-models.\\nThey are superior because this period\\'s\\ninitially given equipment-models and labor\\nperform better than how these inputs\\nwould have performed without the new\\nideas. So why should the possibilities with\\na period\\'s capital goods-a given vintage\\nbecome exhausted during a specific period\\nfor which a specific level of technological\\nknowledge is defined? If the possibilities do\\nnot become exhausted in this fashion, then\\na level of technological knowledge ceases\\nto be uniquely described by (or embodied\\ninto) a specific vintage of capital goods.\\nIn the absence of strong empirical sup-\\nport for the hypothesis of pure capital-\\naugmentation and of the required addi-\\ntional assumption, I have fewer misgivings\\nabout disembodiment than about embodi-\\nment.

I am concerned with\\nthe question how the social yield of pro-\\ngress-inputs compares with that of other\\ninputs, and this concern calls for placing\\nemphasis on the indirectness with which\\nthe progress-inputs produce additional\\nmeasured oUtput.29 Thus, for the present\\npurpose it is useful to have a framework\\nin which the progress-inputs increase the\\n\" quality\" of the other inputs and in which\\nthe other inputs produce quantities of\\noutput.\\nIn practice the effort to let the produc-\\ntivity-increases of inputs express them-\\nselves in quality-changes for given physical\\nquantities, and to translate the quality-\\nimprovements of consumer goods into\\nquantities, gives rise to many procedural\\ndifficulties and the methods for taking care\\nof these are admittedly very imperfect.

Progress-Generating Inputs and Costs:\\nThe Significance of the\\n\"Unrecorded\" Items3\"\\nFrom 1953 to 1966 total recorded R & D\\nrose from $5.2 billion to $22.2 billion, and\\nthis represents a better than twofold in-\\nincrease when R & D is expressed as a\\nproportion of the privately produced\\nGNP. This proportion rose from 1.6 per-\\ncent to 3.3 percent.32 While an appreciable\\npart of this increase was \"real\"-i.e.,\\n\"physical\"- considerable importance at-\\ntaches to changes in relative values.\\nThe question of the weight of the real-\\ninput component versus the relative-valua-\\ntion component of the increase of the ratio\\nof R & D-cost to private GNP is discussed\\nquantitatively in Appendix B. This ques-\\ntion is of some importance because the\\nrelative-valuation component represents\\nin part rent-formation-a mere transfer of\\nincome-rather than a rise of social costs.\\nHowever, in any event, even the relative-\\nvaluation component represents in good\\npart rising social costs, because the rela-\\ntively-rising salaries of research workers\\n(and also of teachers) have attracted into\\nthe progress activities individuals whose\\nqualifications and productivity would be\\nhigher also in other occupations. This must\\nhave been the driving force of the transfer.\\nSuch a phenomenon is accompanied by\\nrent-formation, but I suspect that in the\\nprogress-activities-particularly in reseach\\nand higher education-the rent-formation\\naccompanying the rise of social costs is\\nsmaller than in the types of activity mostly\\nreferred to when the nature of the transfer-\\nrent problem is illustrated.33\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'We have just seen that from 1953 to\\n1966 the ratio of total recorded R & D cost\\nto private GNP rose by more than 100\\npercent. For the period 1929-1953 only\\nsporadic and incomplete data are avail-\\nable, but there is good reason to conclude\\nthat during this period there occurred a\\nvery significant increase of R & D inputs in\\nrelation to real private GNP, and that in\\nterms of undeflated values the increase was\\neven more substantial than in real terms\\n(see Appendix B). These increases are out\\nof line with the rise of the rate of produc-\\ntivity-increase. The latter is a 60 percent\\nor, at most, a 75 percent increase even if we\\ngo back to 1900-1929 and thus compare\\nthe pre-1929 period with the present.34\\nThe efficiency of the edutcational com-\\nplement of research would to some extent\\nbecome adjusted to the requirements set\\nby new knowledge-production even if\\nper capita knowledge inputs did not rise in\\nquantity. In reality the quantity of these\\ninputs has risen appreciably. Partly from\\nHEW data and partly from those of Fritz\\nMachlup, I infer that from the calendar\\nyear 1953 to 1966 the cost of increased per\\ncapita education rose from the equivalent\\nof 0.3 percent of private GNP to the\\nequivalent of about 0.5 percent (see Ap-\\npendix B). Increased education works it-\\nself out with significant lags, but an ap-\\npreciable rate of increase dates back far\\ninto the past. Therefore, trend-appraisals\\nare not appreciably distorted if we asso-\\nciate 0.3 percent with the 1953 benefit, and\\n0.5 percent with the 1966 benefit, though\\nthe levels of the rates of progress-return\\nare somewhat distorted-i.e., are calcu-\\nlated as if the lag did not exist-a fact that\\nneed not disturb us much because the\\nsmaller cost of the past, which in view of\\nthe lag would represent a more appro-\\npriate present charge, arose correspond-\\ningly earlier and for that reason should be\\nviewed as the equivalent of more than the\\nundiscounted figure suggests.35\\nAs for the industry-financed (institu-\\ntionally profit-oriented) R & D, this rose\\nfrom $2.2 billions in 1953 to $7.2 billions in\\n1966. When expressed in relation to private\\nGNP we obtain a rise from 0.7 percent to\\n1.1 percent. In Appendix B it is shown that\\nthe post-1953 rise of this particular propor-\\ntion is likely to have been mainly (perhaps\\nentirely) the result of the increase in the\\nrelative prices of R & D inputs. That is to\\nsay, here the relative-valuation component\\naccounts for practically the entire effect,\\nwhile for total R & D, the real-input com-\\nponent also was significant (even for 1953-\\n1966).\\nRegardless of whether we are interested\\nin yields on our all-inclusive cost-base or in\\nyields on a cost-base limited to institu-\\ntionally yield-oriented progress-inputs, ex-\\nclusive concern on the cost-side with\\nrecorded R & D and with increased per\\ncapita education would lead to the twin\\nconclusions that yields have been declining\\nsteeply and that they nevertheless still are\\nat a \"perplexing\" level. Such calculations\\nare misleading because they disregard the\\nfact that obsolescence in the conventional\\nsense, as well as some costs of a character\\nsimilar to that of obsolescense, and also\\nsome costs of a different kind, are omitted\\nfrom the recorded progress-generating costs.\\nThis is so even if for the present purpose we\\nregard the education costs in Machlup\\'s\\nbroadened sense as \"recorded.\" Many of\\nthe unrecorded costs, including obsoles-\\ncense itself, fall in the category which in\\nSection I, I called costs of changeovers to\\n\\n###',\n",

In a continuously progressing\\neconomy the inputs used for the obsoles-\\ncence-component of capital-replacement\\nare continuously withheld from the pro-\\nduction of consumer goods or from net\\ninvestment (or from the public-sector\\ncounterparts of these). 37\\nA list of the items that may be regarded\\nas unrecorded costs is presented in Appen-\\ndix C, along with explanations. In spite\\nof the large number of items on the list,\\nwe may take it for granted that only one\\nitem-conventional obsolescence-corre-\\nsponds individually to an appreciable pro-\\nportion of private GNP.

The\\nquestion here is: how much more? This, I\\nbelieve, has remained an unexplored ques-\\ntion which would deserve a research effort.\\nIn the absence of dependable information,\\nI suggest two guidelines for the present\\npurpose. I will base my subsequent rea-\\nsoning more on the second than on the\\nfirst of these.\\n1) By assuming that total capital con-\\nsumption typically amounts to about 12\\npercent as expressed in relation to private\\nGNP, and by charging one-fourth of this to\\ntechnological advance for obsolescence, one\\nis unlikely to overcharge the progress-\\naccount. One way of visualizing the im-\\nplications of a charge of such size-3 per-\\ncent of private GNP-is to note that it is\\nconsistent with the hypothesis that in\\norder to arrive at a doubling of the useful\\nservice lives, the users of capital goods\\nwould have to increase their present ex-\\npenditures on current repairs and main-\\ntenance by the equivalent of about 50\\npercent of what would then become their\\nreduced current capital-consumption cost.39\\nFor structures which represent a very\\nweighty component of the capital stock,\\nthis is quite likely to be an overstatement\\nof the costs of extending the now usual ser-\\nvice lives, hence an understatement of the\\ncosts to be set against technological ad-\\nvance and against the rise of living stan-\\ndards in which it expresses itself. The same\\nmay be true of some types of equipment,\\nbut there undoubtedly exist types for\\nwhich these numerical assumptions under-\\nstate the costs of the extension of service\\nlife, and thus overstate the cost of progress.\\nOn the whole, charging 3 percent of private\\nGNP is unlikely to err (or to err much) on\\nthe high side of costs, and this charge\\nmight well err on the low side. As long as\\nwe try not to overcharge we may add\\nmerely 1 percent of the private GNP for\\nunrecorded costs other than obsolescence,\\ni.e., for the other costs listed in Appendix C.\\nWe arrive at 4 percent of private GNP for\\nwhat I consider a \"moderate\" estimate of\\nthe unrecorded costs, though I will not\\nbuild much on this figure.\\n2) An immoderate overstatement of the\\nobsolescence-cost of progress would be\\nobtained by charging to progress the\\nentire capital-consumption-i.e., about 12\\npercent of private GNP-and by adding 2\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The flow of\\nlearned articles, monographs, and text-\\nbooks is swelling like a tidal wave; Eco-\\nnometrica, the leading journal in the field\\nof mathematical economics, has just\\nstepped up its publication schedule from\\nfour to six issues per annum.\\nAnd yet an uneasy feeling about the\\npresent state of our discipline has been\\ngrowing in some of us who have watched\\nits unprecedented development over the\\nlast three decades. This concern seems to\\nbe shared even by those who are them-\\nselves contributing successfully to the\\npresent boom. They play the game with\\nprofessional skill but have serious doubts\\nabout its rules.\\nMuch of current academic teaching and\\nresearch has been criticized for its lack of\\nrelevance, that is, of immediate practical\\nimpact. In a nearly instant response to\\nthis criticism, research projects, seminars\\naind undergraduate courses have been\\nset up on poverty, on city and small town\\nslums, on pure water and fresh air. In an\\nalmost Pavlovian reflex, whenever a new\\ncomplaint is raised, President Nixon ap-\\npoints a commission and the university\\nannounces a new course. Far be it from\\nme to argue that the fire should not be\\nshifted when the target moves. The trouble\\nis caused, however, not by an inadequate\\nselection of targets, but rather by our\\ninability to hit squarely any one of them.\\nThe uneasiness of which I spoke before is\\ncaused not by the irrelevance of the practi-\\ncal problems to which present day econo-\\nmists address their efforts, but rather by\\nthe palpable inadequacy of the scientific\\nmeans with which they try to solve them.\\nIf this simply were a sign of the overly\\nhigh aspiration level of a fast developing\\ndiscipline, such a discrepancy between ends\\nand means should cause no worry. But I\\nsubmit that the consistently indifferent\\nperformance in practical applications is in\\nfact a symptom of a fundamental imbal-\\nance in the present state of our discipline.\\nThe weak and all too slowly growing empir-\\nical foundation clearly cannot support\\nthe proliferating superstructure of pure, or\\nshould I say, speculative economic theory.\\nMuch is being made of the widespread,\\nnearly mandatory use by modern eco-\\nnomic theorists of mathematics.

Unemployment\\nand inflation still preoccupy and perplex\\neconomists, statesmen, journalists, house-\\nwives, and everyone else. The connection\\nbetween them is the principal domestic\\neconomic burden of presidents and prime\\nministers, and the major area of contro-\\nversy and ignorance in macroeconomics.\\nI have chosen to review economic thought\\non this topic on this occasion, partly be-\\ncause of its inevitable timeliness, partly\\nbecause of a personal interest reaching\\nback to my first published work in 1941.\\nI.

That outcome is so\\ninconceivable outside of Switzerland that\\nit is useless as a guide to policy. Any other\\nnumerical candidate, yes even 4 percent,\\nis patently arbitrary without reference to\\nbasic criteria. Unemployment equal to\\nvacancies? Measurement problems aside,\\nthis definition has the same straightfor-\\nward appeal as zero unemployment, which\\nit simply corrects for friction.1\\nA concept of full employment more\\ncongenial to economic theory is labor\\nmarket equilibrium, a volume of employ-\\nment which is simultaneously the amount\\nemployers want to offer and the amount\\nworkers want to accept at prevailing wage\\nrates and prices. Forty years ago theorists\\nwith confidence in markets could believe\\nthat full employment is whatever volume\\nof employment the economy is moving\\ntoward, and that its achievement requires\\nof the government nothing more than\\nneutrality, and nothing less\\nAfter Keynes challenged the classical\\nnotion of labor market equilibrium and\\nthe complacent view of policy to which it\\nled, full employment came to mean max;-\\nmum aggregate supply, the point at which\\nexpansion of aggregate demand could not\\nfurther increase employment and output.\\nFull employment was also regarded as\\nthe economy\\'s inflation threshold. With a\\ndeflationary gap, demand less than full\\nemployment supply, prices would be de-\\nclining or at worst constant.

In its place came the tradeoff,\\nalong which society supposedly can choose\\nthe least undesirable feasible combination\\nof the evils of unemployment and inflation.\\nMany economists deny the existence of\\na durable Phillips tradeoff. TIheir numbers\\nand influence are increasing. Some of them\\ncontendl that there is only one rate of\\nunemployment compatible with steady\\ninflation, a \"natural rate\" consistent with\\nany steadly rate of change of prices, posi-\\ntive, zero, or negative. The natural rate is\\nanother full employment candidate, a\\npolicy target at least in the passive sense\\nthat monetary and fiscal policy makers\\nare advised to eschew any numerical un-\\nemployment goal and to let the economy\\ngravitate to this equilibrium. So we have\\ncome full circle. Full employment is once\\nagain nothing but the equilibrium reached\\nby labor markets unaidedl andl undlistorted\\nby governmental fine tuning.\\nIn discussing these issues, I shall make\\nthe following points. First, an observed\\namount of unemployment is not revealed\\nto be voluntary simply by the fact that\\nmoney wage rates are constant, or rising,\\nor even accelerating. I shall recall and ex-\\ntend Keynes\\'s dlefinition of involuntary\\nunemployment and his explanation why\\nworkers may accept price inflation as a\\nmethod of re(lucing real wages while re-\\njecting money wage cuts. The second\\npoint is related. Involuntary unemploy-\\nment is a disequilibrium phenomenon;\\nthe behavior, the persistence, of excess\\nsupplies of labor depend on how and how\\nfast markets adjust to shocks, and on how\\nlarge and how frequent the shocks are.\\nHigher prices or faster inflation can\\n(liminish involuntary, disequilibrium un-\\nemployment, even though voluntary, eqlui-\\nlibrium labor supply is entirely free of\\nmoney illusion.\\nThird, various criteria of full employ-\\nment coincide in a theoretical full sta-\\ntionary eqjuilibrium, but diverge in per-\\nsistent disequilibrium. These are 1) the\\nnatural rate of unemployment, the rate\\ncompatible with zero or some other con-\\nstant inflation rate, 2) zero involuntary\\nunemployment, 3) the rate of unemploy-\\nment needed for optimal job search and\\nplacement, and 4) unemployment equal\\nto job vacancies. The first criterion dic-\\ntates higher unemployment than any of\\nthe rest. Instead of commending the natu-\\nral rate as a target of employment policy,\\nthe other three criteria suggest less un-\\nemployment and more inflation. Therefore,\\nfourth, there are real gains from addi-\\ntional employment, which must be\\nweighed in the social balance against the\\ncosts of inflation. I shall conclude with a\\nfew remarks on this choice, and on the\\npossibilities of improving the terms of the\\ntradeoff.\\nII. Keynesian and Classical Interpreta-\\ntions of Unemployment\\nTo begin with the General Theory is not\\njust the ritual piety economists of my\\ngeneration owe the book that shaped their\\nminds.

Orthodox economists found the ob-\\nserved stickiness of money wages to be\\npersuasive evidence that unemployment,\\neven in the Great Depression, was volun-\\ntary. Keynes found decisive evidence\\nagainst this inference in the willingness of\\nworkers to accept a larger volume of em-\\nployment at a lower real wage resulting\\nfrom an increase of prices.\\nWhenever unemployment could be re-\\nduced by expansion of aggregate demand,\\nKeynes regarded it as involuntary. He ex-\\npected expansion to raise prices and lower\\nreal wages, but this expectation is not\\ncrucial to his argument. Indeed, if it is pos-\\nsible to raise employment without reduction\\nin the real wage, his case for calling the un-\\nemployment involuntary is strengthened.\\nBut why is the money wage so stubborn\\nif more labor is willingly available at the\\nsame or lower real wage5? Consider first\\nsome answers Keynes did not give. He did\\nnot appeal to trade union monopolies or\\nminimum wage laws. He was anxious, per-\\nhaps over-anxious, to meet his putative\\nclassical opponents on their home field,\\nthe competitive economy\\\\ He did not rely\\non any failure of workers to perceive what\\na rise in prices does to real wages. The un-\\nemployed take new jobs, the employed\\nhold old ones, with eyes open. Otherwise\\nthe new situation would be transient.\\nInstead, Keynes emphasized the insti-\\ntutional fact that wages are bargained\\nand set in the monetary unit of account.\\nMoney wage rates are, to use an unKeynes-\\nian term, \"administered prices.\" I\\'hat is,\\nthey are not set and reset in daily auctions\\nbut posted and fixed for finite periods of\\ntime. This observation led Keynes to his\\ncentral explanation: Workers, individually\\nand in groups, are more concerned with\\nrelative than absolute real wages. They\\nmay withdraw labor if their wages fall\\nrelatively to wages elsewhere, even though\\nthey would not withdraw any if real wages\\nfall uniformly everywhere. Labor markets\\nare decentralized, and there is no way\\nmoney wages can fall in any one market\\nwithout impairing the relative status of\\nthe workers there. A general rise in prices\\nis a neutral and universal method of re-\\nducing real wages, the only method in a\\ndecentralized and uncontrolled economy.\\nInflation would not be needed, we may\\ninfer, if by government compulsion, econ-\\nomy-wide bargaining, or social compact,\\nall money wage rates could be scaled down\\ntogether.\\nKeynes apparently meant that relative\\nwages are the arguments in labor supply\\nfunctions. But Alchian (pp. 27-52 in Phelps\\net al.) and other theorists of search ac-\\ntivity have offered a somewhat different\\ninterpretation, namely that workers whose\\nmoney wages are reduced will quit their\\njobs to seek employment in other markets\\nwhere they think, perhaps mistakenly,\\nthat wages remain high.\\nKeynes\\'s explanation of money wage\\nstickiness is plausible and realistic. But two\\nrelated analytical issues have obscured the\\nmessage. Can there be involuntary unem-\\nployment in an equilibrium, a proper, full-\\nfledged neoclassical equilibrium? Does the\\nlabor supply behavior described by Keynes\\nbetray \"money illusion\"? Keynes gave a\\nloud yes in answer to the first question,\\nand this seems at first glance to compel an\\naffirmative answer to the second.\\nAn economic theorist can, of course,\\ncommit no greater crime than to assume\\nmoney illusion.

Only\\nat the natural rate of unemployment are\\nworkers content with current and prospec-\\ntive real wages, content to have their real\\nwages rise at the rate of growth of pro-\\nductivity. Along the feasible path of real\\nwages they would not wish to accept any\\nlarger volume of employment.

But this intention is always\\nfrustrated, the gap is never closed, money\\nwages and prices accelerate. By sym-\\nmetrical argument, unemployment above\\nthe natural rate signifies excess supply in\\nlabor markets and ever accelerating de-\\nflation. Older classical economists regarded\\nconstancy of money wage rates as indica-\\ntive of full employment equilibrium, at\\nwhich the allocation of time between work\\nand other pursuits is revealed as voluntary\\nand optimal. Their successors make the\\nsame claims for the natural rate of un-\\nemployment, except that in the equilib-\\nrium money wages are not necessarily\\nconstant but growing at the rate of pro-\\nductivity gain plus the experienced and\\nexpected rate of inflation of prices.\\nIII. Is Zero-Inflation Unemployment\\nVoluntary and Optimal?\\nThere are, then, two conflicting inter-\\npretations of the welfare value of employ-\\nment in excess of the level consistent with\\nprice stability. One is that additional\\nemployment does not produce enough to\\ncompensate workers for the value of other\\nuses of their time. The fact that it gener-\\nates inflation is taken as prima facie\\nevidence of a welfare loss. The alternative\\nview, which I shall argue, is that the re-\\nsponses of money wages and prices to\\nchanges in aggregate demand reflect\\nmechanics of adjustment, institutional\\nconstraints, and relative wage patterns\\nand reveal nothing in particular about\\nindividual or social valuations of unem-\\nployed time vis-a-vis the wages of em-\\nployment.\\nOn this rostrum four years ago, Milton\\nFriedman identified the noninflationary\\nnatural rate of unemployment with \"equi-\\nlibrium in the structure of real wage\\nrates\" (p. 8). \"The \\'natural rate of unem-\\nployment,\\' \" he said, \". . . is the level\\nthat would be ground out by the Walrasian\\nsystem of general equilibrium equations,\\nprovided that there is embedded in them\\nthe actual structural characteristics of the\\nlabor and commodity markets, including\\nmarket imperfections, stochastic variabil-\\nity in demands and supplies, the costs of\\ngetting information about job vacancies\\nand labor availabilities, the costs of mo-\\nbility, and so on.\" Presumably this\\nWalrasian equilibrium also has the usual\\noptimal properties; at any rate, Friedman\\nadvised the monetary authorities not to\\nseek to improve upon it.

First, about 40 percent of accessions\\nin manufacturing are rehires rather than\\nnew hires. Temporarily laid off by their\\nemployers, these workers had been await-\\ning recall and were scarcely engaged in\\nvoluntary search activity. Their unem-\\nployment is as much a deadweight loss as\\nthe disguised unemployment of redundant\\nworkers oni payrolls. This number declines\\nto 25-30 percent when unemployment is\\n4 percent or below. Likewise, a 5-6 perceint\\nunemployment rate means that voluntary\\nquits amount only to about a third of\\nseparations, layoffs to two-thir(-ds.

I propose\\nnow to sketch a theory in the same\\nspirit.\\nIt is an essential feature of the theory\\nthat economy-wide relations among em-\\nployment, wages, and prices are aggrega-\\ntions of diverse outcomes in heterogeneous\\nmarkets. The myth of macroeconomics is\\nthat relations among aggregates are en-\\nlarged analogues of relations among cor-\\nresponding variables for individual house-\\nholds, firms, industries, markets. The myth\\nis a harmless and useful simplification in\\nmany contexts, but sometimes it misses\\nthe essence of the phenomenon.\\nUnemployment is, in this model as in\\nKeynes reinterpreted, a disequilibrium phe-\\nnomenon. Money wages do not adjust\\nrapidly enough to clear all labor markets\\nevery clay. Excess supplies in labor mar-\\nkets take the form of unemployment, and\\nexcess demands the form of unfilled\\nvacancies. At any moment, markets vary\\nwidlely in excess demand or supply, and\\nthe economy as a whole shows both\\nvacancies and unemployment.\\nThe overall balance of vacancies and\\nunemployment is determined by aggregate\\ndemand, and is therefore in principle sub-\\nject to control by overall monetary and\\nfiscal policy. Higher aggregate demand\\nmeans fewer excess supply markets and\\nmore excess demand markets, accordingly\\nless unemployment and more vacancies.\\nIn any particular labor market, the rate\\nof increase of money wages is the sum of\\ntwo components, an equilibrium compo-\\nnent and a disequilibrium component. The\\nfirst is the rate at which the wage would\\nincrease were the market in equilibrium,\\nwith neither vacancies nor unemployment.\\nThe other component is a function of ex-\\ncess demand and supply-a monotonic\\nfunction, positive for positive excess de-\\nmand, zero for zero excess demand, non-\\npositive for excess supply. I begin with\\nthe disequilibrium component.\\nOf course the disequilibrium compo-\\nnents are relevant only if disequilibria\\npersist. Why aren't they eliminated bv the\\nvery adjustments they set in motion ?\\nWorkers will move from excess supply\\nmarkets to excess demand markets, and\\nfrom low wage to high wage markets.\\nUnless they overshoot, these movements\\nare equilibrating.

Full employment in the sense of\\nequality of vacancies and unemployment\\nis not compatible with price stability.\\nZero inflation requires unemployment in\\nexcess of vacancies.\\nCriteria that coincide in full long-run\\nequilibrium zero inflation and zero ag-\\ngregate excess demand diverge in sto-\\nchastic macro-equilibrium. Full long-run\\nequilibrium in all markets would show no\\nunemployment, no vacancies, no unantici-\\npated inflation. But with unending sec-\\ntoral flux, zero excess (lemand spells in-\\nflation and zero inflation spells net excess\\nsupply, unemployment in excess of va-\\ncancies.

Wage rates for existing em-\\nployees set the standards for new em-\\nployees, too.\\nThe equilibrium components of wage\\nincreases, it has been argued, depend on\\npast wage increases throughout the econ-\\nomy. In those theoretical and econo-\\nmetric models of inflation where labor\\nmarkets are aggregated into a single\\nmarket, this relationship is expressed as\\nan autoregressive equation of fixed struc-\\nture: current wage increase depends on\\npast wage increases. The same description\\napplies when past wage increases enter in-\\ndirectly, mediated by price inflation and\\nproductivity change.

Housing,\\nhealth services, and local transportation\\nare among the leading cases. The depriva-\\ntion and social distress that follow from\\nthe poor performance of these industries\\nare also something that, in their nondoctri-\\nnal manifestation, most economists take\\nfor granted.\\nThe defender of the established doctrine\\ndoes, of course, argue that excess and\\ndeprivation in resource use in the areas\\njust mentioned reflect consumer choice.\\nAnd in the areas of deprivation he can\\nrightly insist that the fault lies with firms\\nthat, though small, are local monopolies\\nor reflect the monopoly power of unions.\\nThese explanations beg two remarkably\\nobvious questions: Why does the modern\\nconsumer increasingly tend to insanity,\\nincreasingly insist on self-abuse? And why\\ndo little monopolies perform badly and the\\nbig ones too well?\\nIn fact the neoclassical model has no\\nexplanation of the most important micro-\\neconomic problem of our time.

Save in its\\nstrictly mystical manifestation in one\\nbranch of monetary theory, modern macro-\\neconomic policy depends for its validity\\nand workability on the neoclassical mar-\\nket. That market, whether competitive,\\nmonopolistic, or oligopolistic, is the ulti-\\nmate and authoritative instruction to the\\nprofit-maximizing firm. When output and\\nemployment are deficient, policy requires\\nthat aggregate demand be increased; this\\nis an instruction to the market to which\\nfirms in turn respond. When the economy\\nis at or near the effective capacity of the\\nplant and the labor force and inflation is\\nthe relevant social discomfort, the remedy\\nis reversed.

But then a\\nyear and. a half ago, facing reelection, he\\nfound that his economists' comnmitment\\nto neoclassical and Keynesian orthodoxy,\\nhowever admirable in the abstract, was a\\nluxury that he could no longer afford. He\\napostatized to wage and price control; so,\\nwith exemplary flexibility of mind, did\\nhis economists although admittedly this\\nacceptance of the real world has still to\\nsurvive its critical test which is the\\napostates' return to computers and class-\\nrooms.

And it is even\\nmore disturbing that few are now working\\non the policy which we have been forced\\nto follow.\\nMore economists, in fact, are still con-\\ncerning themselves with the effort to re-\\nconcile controls with the neoclassical\\nmarket. This has involved an unrewarding\\ncombination of economics and archeology\\nwith wishful thinking. It holds that an\\ninflationary momentum developed during\\nthe late 1960's in connection with the\\nfinancing--or underfinancing of the Viet-\\nnam war. And inflationary expectation\\nbecame part of business and trade union\\ncalculation. The momentum and expecta-\\ntion still survive. The controls are neces-\\nsary until these are dissipated.

(The latter term seems\\nto me more descriptive, less pejorative and\\nthus preferable.) The planning system con-\\nsists in the United States of, at the most,\\n2,000 large corporations. In their opera-\\ntion they have power that transcends the\\nmarket. They rival where they do not\\nborrow from the power of the state.

What it needs in research\\nand development, technically qualified\\npeople, public works, emergency financial\\nsupport, becomes public policy. So does the\\nmilitary procurement that sustains the\\ndemand for numerous of its products. So,\\nperhaps, does the foreign policy that\\njustifies the military procurement.

The men who guide the\\nmodern corporation, including the finan-\\ncial, legal, technical, advertising, and other\\nsacerdotal authorities in corporate func-\\ntion, are the most respectable, affluent,\\nand prestigious members of the national\\ncommunity. They are the Establishment.\\nTheir interest tends to become the public\\ninterest. It is an interest that even some\\neconomists find it comfortable and reward-\\ning to avow.\\nThat interest, needless to say, is pro-\\nfoundly concerned with power with win-\\ning acceptance by others of the collective\\nor corporate purpose. It does not disavow\\nprofits. These are important for ensuring\\nthe autonomy of the management what\\nI have called the technostructure and for\\nbringing the supply of capital within the\\ncontrol of the firm. Profits are also a\\nsource of prestige and therewith of influ-\\nence. But of paramount importance is the\\nmuch more directly political goal of\\ngrowth. Such growth carries a strong eco-\\nnomic reward; it directly enhances the\\npay, perquisites, and opportunities for\\npromotion of the members of the techno-\\nstructure. And it consolidates and enhances\\nauthority. It does this for the individual-\\nfor the man who now heads a larger\\norganization or a larger part of an organi-\\nzation than before.

It rightly sees the\\nunmanaged sovereignty of the consumer,\\nthe ultimate sovereignty of the citizen and\\nthe maximization of profits and resulting\\nsubordination of the firm to the market\\nas the three legs of a tripod on which it\\nstands. These are what exclude the role of\\npower in the system. All three propositions\\ntax the capacity for belief.

That\\nis a prospect by which we would rightly be\\nrepelled. Political science is also the captive\\nof its stereotypes including that of citizen\\ncontrol of the state.

How\\nwrong are we allowed to be!\\nThe counterpart of excessive resource\\nuse in the planning system where power is\\ncomprehensively deployed is a relatively\\ndeficient resource use where power is cir-\\ncumscribed. Such will be the case in the\\npart of the economy where competition\\nand entrepreneurial monopoly as distinct\\nfrom great organization are the rule. And\\nif the product or service is closely related\\nto comfort or survival, the discontent will\\nbe considerable. That housing, health\\nservices, local transportation, some house-\\nhold services, are now areas of grave in-\\nadequacy is agreed. It is in such industries\\nthat all modern governments seek to ex-\\npand resource use. Here, in desperation,\\neven the devout free enterprisers accept\\nthe need for social action, even of social-\\nism.\\nAgain, we may observe, the error of\\neconomics is prejudicial.

And though as citizens we urge social\\naction where the firm approaches the neo-\\nclassical norm, our teaching does not.

The same power allows it to\\naccept unions for it need not absorb even\\ntemporarily their demands. In the market\\nsystem, some areas of monopoly or union\\npower apart, there is no similar control of\\nthe terms of trade. Given the absence of\\nmarket power there can be no similar\\nyielding on wage costs for there is no\\nsimilar certainty that they can be passed\\non. (It is because of the character of the\\nindustry he seeks to organize, not his\\noriginal power, that Cesar Chavez is for so\\nmany the new Lenin.) And, in the market\\nsystem, the self-employed have the option\\nnot present in the planning system of\\nreducing their own wages (and sometimes\\nthose of families or immediate employees)\\nin order to survive.\\nThus there is a built-in inequality in\\nincome between the two systems.

Again there is reassurance in a\\nview of the economy that prepares us for\\nthe politics of our time.\\nThe inclusion of power in economic cal-\\nculus also prepares us for the great debate\\nover the environment. It is the claim of\\nneoclassical economics that it foresaw\\npossible environmental consequences from\\neconomic development-that it, some\\ntime ago, embraced the concept of external\\ndiseconomies of production and, by infer-\\nence, of consumption. Alas, this is a modest\\nclaim. The noninclusion of external dis-\\neconomies was long viewed as a minor\\ndefect of the price system-an after-\\nthought for an hour's classroom discus-\\nsion. And, as E. J. Mishan has observed,\\nit was largely ignored in the textbooks.\\nNor does the notion of external disecon-\\nomies now offer a useful remedy. No one\\ncan suppose, or really supposes, that more\\nthan a fraction of the damage especially\\nthat to the beauty and tranquility of our\\nsurroundings -could be compensated in\\nany useful way by internalizing external\\ndiseconomies.\\nIf growth is the central and rewarding\\npurpose of the firm and if power is com-\\nprehensively available to impose this goal\\non the society, the possibility of conflict\\nbetween private growth and public pur-\\npose as regards the environment is im-\\nmediately plausible. So, since this power\\ndepends extensively not on force but\\npersuasion, is the effort to make pollution\\nseem palatable or worth the cost, including\\nthe effort to nmake advertising of remedial\\naction a substitute for action. And so is the\\nremedy to which all industrial countries\\nare being forced. This is not, primarily, to\\ninternalize external diseconomies. Rather\\nit is to specify the legal parameters within\\nwhich growth may proceed or, as in the\\ncase of automobile use in central cities,\\nairplane use over urban areas, the SST,\\nindustrial, commercial, and residential\\nappropriation of countryside andI roadside,\\nthe kinds of growth that are inconsistent\\nwith public purpose. We would have saved\\nmuch corruption of our surroundings if\\nour economics had held such action to be\\nthe predictable consequence of the pursuit\\nof present economic goals and not the\\nexceptional result of a peculiar aberration\\nof the price system.\\nWe had best, in any case, have the right\\nguide to action for the future for there is a\\nstrong conservative case for such guidance.\\nWhile economists toy weakly with ex-\\nternal diseconomies, others are arguing\\nthat growth itself is the villain. They are\\nseeking its extinction. To see environ-\\nmental damage as a natural consequence\\nof planning power and purpose and to see,\\nin consequence, the need for confining\\ngrowth within parameters that protect the\\npublic interest could be important for en-\\nsuring continued economic growth.\\nFinally, when power becomes part of our\\nsystem, so does Ralph Nader. We are\\nprepared for the explosion of concern now\\ncalled consumerism. If the consumer is the\\nultimate source of authority, his abuse is\\nan occasional fault.

Now in\\ngeneral equilibrium any part of the system\\naffects every other part in at least two\\ndifferent ways. Thus, we may ask two\\nquestions about the nonexistence of futures\\ngoods markets: what are its implications\\nfor the rest of the system and what are the\\nreasons for its nonexistence.\\nThe implication first of all is that the\\ninformation needed by the optimizer is not\\nprovided by an existing market. It will be\\nprovided by a market which will exist in\\nthe future, but that is a bit too late to help\\nin decisions made today. Hence, the op-\\ntimizer must replace the market commit-\\nment to buy or sell at given terms by\\nexpectations: expectations of prices and\\nexpectations of quantities to be bought or\\nsold. But he cannot know the future.\\nHence, unless he deludes himself, he must\\nknow that both sets of expectations may\\nbe wrong. In short, the absence of the\\nmarket implies that the optimizer faces a\\nworld of uncertainty.\\nThe exact modelling of behavior under\\nuncertainty is probably not crucial to the\\nsubsequent discussion; let us use the\\nconventional expected-utility hypothesis.\\nWhen there is uncertainty, risk aversion\\nimplies that steps will be taken to reduce\\nrisks. This partly affects decisions within\\nthe firm, such as the holding of inventories\\nand preference for flexible capital equip-\\nment, and partly leads to new markets\\nwhich will shift risks to those most able\\nand willing to bear them, particularly\\nthrough the equity market. The rich de-\\nvelopment of inventory theory and port-\\nfolio theory in the last twenty years or so\\nreflects growing understanding of these\\nmatters.\\nBut when we speak of expected utilities,\\nwe need to have some probabilities. Where\\ndo these come from? We may in the first\\ninstance regard them as subjective. But\\nthe economic agent observes his world and\\nhas the opportunity to learn from his ex-\\nperience, for there is a considerable degree\\nof continuity. By Bayes\\' Theorem or per-\\nhaps psychological learning theory, the\\nprobabilities, say of future prices, will\\ngradually adjust so as to conform to the\\nfacts. If indeed the econromic world ex-\\nhibited the same structure in some sense\\nfrom period to period, and if everybody\\nobserved everything relevant, then the\\nprobabilities ascribed by different individ-\\nuals to the same events might be expected\\ngradually to converge to the correct values\\nand therefore be the same for all. In fact,\\nof course, the basic economic facts are\\nchanging, partly endogenously because of\\ncapital accumulation in its most general\\nsense, partly exogenously with predictable\\nand unpredictable changes in technology\\nand tastes; equally if not more important,\\nthough, is the fact that the dispersion of\\ninformation which is so economical implies\\nthat different economic agents do not have\\naccess to the same observations. Hence, it\\nis reasonable to infer that they will never\\ncome into agreement as to probabilities of\\nfuture prices.\\nA further implication is that the past in-\\nfluences the future. Jevons\\'s well-known\\nslogan, \"bygones are forever bygones,\"\\nceases to be fully accurate. The past is rele-\\nvant because it contains information\\nwhich changes the image of the future; the\\nprobabilities which govern future actions\\nare modified by observations on the past.\\nIt follows that present decisions with im-\\nplications for the future are functions of\\npast values of variables as well as present\\nvalues.\\nThis point of view has been exploited in\\nthe econometric models which have used\\ndistributed lags in explaining investment\\ndecisions.

The im-\\nportance of quantity expectations has been\\nstressed in macroeconomic models, even in\\nsuch pre-Keynesian concepts as the ac-\\nceleration principle, and most especially in\\nrelation to inventories. It sometimes is\\nheld that in a neoclassical world only prices\\nmatter; in the absence of prices, presum-\\nably they are replaced by price expecta-\\ntions. But that is not strictly true. Under\\nconstant returns, at least, quantity in-\\nformation for the individual firm is needed\\neven when neoclassical assumptions are\\nstrictly fulfilled. Neoclassically founded in-\\nvestment theories usually predict capital-\\noutput ratios or capital-labor ratios; they\\nstill need output forecasts explicitly or im-\\nplicitly. This gives considerable, perhaps\\nmajor weight to past quantity information\\nin predicting the future and therefore in\\nguiding current investment decisions. It is\\nperhaps along these lines that Keynesian\\ntheory, with its overwhelming emphasis on\\nquantity changes as equilibrating vari-\\nables, can be founded firmly on individual\\noptimizing behavior.\\nI have referred to the fact that informa-\\ntion is dispersed throughout the economy\\nbut have not suggested how.

It\\nseems to me there are two basic causal fac-\\ntors. One is that contracts are not enforce-\\nable without cost and forward contracts\\nare more costly to enforce than contem-\\nporaneous contracts; the other is that be-\\ncause of the many uncertainties about the\\nfuture, neither buyers nor sellers are will-\\ning to make commitments which com-\\npletely define their future actions. Let me\\ntake these two points up in turn.\\nThe ability to make enforceable con-\\ntracts is a necessary but not sufficient\\ncondition for a market. However, there is\\nno way to insure complete enforceability.\\nAn individual may make a contract which\\nhe cannot in fact fulfill. Penalties may in-\\ndeed be imposed on failure to live up to\\none\\'s agreement, but they are not a sub-\\nstitute for compliance from the viewpoint\\nof the other party, and there is always a\\ndegree of cost in enforcing the penalties.\\nThe laws of bankruptcy are a social recog-\\nnition that complete enforceability is im-\\npossible and that it is even socially desir-\\nable to set limits on the penalties for\\nfailure. However, when the exchange of\\nvalues for values is simultaneous or nearly\\nso, the contracts may almost be self-\\nenforcing. If a good has been sold and not\\npaid for, it can be recovered; if there is a\\ncontinuing relation of buyer and seller, a\\nfailure to settle bills can be met by refusal\\nto make further deliveries, in which case\\nthe loss is minimized. With contracts ex-\\ntending into the distant future, on the\\ncontrary, the possibility of failure to com-\\nply becomes greater, partly because the\\nself-enforcement aspects become weaker,\\npartly because unexpected changes may\\nintervene to make even a sincerely in-\\ntended compliance difficult or impossible.\\nThe outstanding examples of forward\\ncontracts are credit instruments. The\\nbuyer, who is taking the risks of default, is\\nmotivated to protect himself by seeking\\nmore information about the seller. The\\nlender wants to know the borrower\\'s as-\\nsets, the prospects for changes in them,\\npossibly even what he is going to do with\\nthe money. This very individualized in-\\nformation-seeking relation is quite far\\nfrom the arm\\'s length impersonal model of\\na market. The so-called capital markets\\nare in many structural aspects very differ-\\nent from our model markets. It is of\\ncourse an empirical question how far their\\nbehavior departs from the model. But\\nthe recurrent theme of credit rationing and\\navailability doctrines, the essential imper-\\nfections of the credit market which un-\\nderlie monetarist theories of cyclical fluc-\\ntuations suggest that the incomplete en-\\nforceability of credit contracts and the\\nprotective steps taken by lenders are sig-\\nnificant factors in explaining the working\\nof the market.\\nWhile the enforceability question ex-\\nplains why those forward contacts that are\\nmade do not constitute a perfect market,\\nwe need more to understand why even\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

There are for-\\nward contracts in money, some com-\\nmodities, real estate, but very little else.\\nThe explanation lies in uncertainties of\\nboth buyers and sellers about prices and\\nquantities and about technology and\\ntastes. Using uncertainties about prices\\nand quantities as an explanation for mar-\\nket failure is a circular argument, though\\nnot necessarily a fallacy. That is, if all\\nmarkets for future goods existed and\\ncleared all transactions, then there would\\nbe no price-quantity uncertainties. But\\nthis much is true; if some markets for fu-\\nture goods do not exist, then the agents\\nhave uncertainties which are relevant to\\ntheir behavior on markets for complemen-\\ntary or substitute goods. As Hicks showed\\na long time ago, complementarity and sub-\\nstitution can occur over time as well as\\nsimultaneously. If, as I will argue in a\\nminute, uncertainty can tend to destroy\\nmarkets, then we can conclude that the\\nabsence of some markets for future goods\\nmay cause others to fail.\\nTo illustrate, the demand for capital\\ngoods at any point of time is dependent on\\nthe prices and sales of the product at fu-\\nture points of time. Therefore the demand\\nfor future capital goods will depend on ex-\\npectations about the product at some still\\nmore removed time. If we assume only\\nthat we will not have markets for products\\nat some distant point of time, then the\\nresulting uncertainty will reflect itself in a\\nfailure of the market for capital goods in\\nthe nearer future, which will in turn create\\nstill further uncertainties.\\nThus, if some markets for future goods\\nare nonexistent, there will be uncertainties\\non the other markets; in addition, demand\\nand supply conditions for the future are\\nuncertain because of technological and\\ntaste shifts. Assume that both buyers and\\nsellers are risk averters. Then without\\ngoing into details it is reasonable to con-\\nclude that both demand and supply will\\nhave a downward bias as compared with\\nthe situation in which uncertainty is ab-\\nsent. A buyer will be unwilling to contract\\nfor purchase of a good if a superior or\\ncheaper substitute may be available; and\\nthe seller will be unwilling to accept a\\nprice sufficiently low to be suitable to the\\nbuyer, particularly if he thereby precludes\\nhimself from a possible opportunity to\\nshift his resources to other closely related\\ngoods. It would seem possible, at least,\\nthat there will be no price at which tran-\\nsactions in future goods will take place.\\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, one might\\nsay that the market is in a strange sort of\\nequilibrium; there is some shadowy sort of\\nprice at which supply and demand are\\nequated at zero. But this price is not per-\\nforming much of a signalling function.\\nThere is one ultra-neoclassical approach\\nto the market treatment of uncertainties,\\nin which I take some pride. That is the no-\\ntion of a contingent market. Instead of\\nletting uncertainty ruin existing markets,\\nwe can take it explicitly into account by\\nbuying and selling commitments to be\\ncarried out only if some uncertain event\\noccurs. We could in principle imagine\\nagreements to transact which will hold if\\nand only a given conceivable technological\\ninnovation does not take place, with a\\nsecond market for transactions valid if the\\ninnovation does take place. Then we can\\nrestore the possibility of markets.\\nSuch contingent markets are not en-\\ntirely unknown; insurance contracts are\\nthe purest example, and equity markets\\nand cost-plus contracts provide more\\nmuddied illustrations. But they are rela-\\ntively rare. Why this should be so follows\\nagain from the general problem of informa-\\ntioin costs and dispersal.

Hence, the\\nrange of possible contingent contracts be-\\ncomes limited to those for whom the events\\nare easily verifiable for both parties. The\\nimplications of these limits are known in\\nthe insurance literature as adverse selec-\\ntion and moral hazard, and they are of\\nimmediate practical significance in such\\nmatters as health insurance. But more\\nbroadly, they so limit the scope of con-\\ntingent markets in practice that, as argued\\nbefore in connection with markets for fu-\\nture goods, they prevent the emergence of\\neven technically possible markets because\\nof the large unresolved uncertainties.\\nI hope enough has been said to indicate\\nthe widespread implications of costly, dis-\\npersed information for the process by\\nwhich future-oriented economic decisions\\nare made. Let me remark, briefly in view\\nof the length of time I have already taken,\\nthat informational costs and values play a\\nkey role in modifying the structure even of\\ncontemporaneous transactions. The in-\\ndividual optimizing agent is supposed to\\nknow at least his technology or tastes and\\nthe prices he faces. We have already ar-\\ngued a good deal of uncertainty with re-\\nspect to the future economic implications\\nof present economic choices. But in addi-\\ntion there is the possibility that techno-\\nlogical information, which would be useful\\nto him, exists somewhere in the world but\\noutside his firm. There are grounds for\\nengaging in the active pursuit of informa-\\ntion. We begin to enter the realm of diffu-\\nsion of innovations, to which some sociolo-\\ngists as well as economists have con-\\ntributed. The interesting points here are\\nthe biasses in the information channels,\\nsome of which, at least, can be explained\\nin terms of differential costs of acquiring\\ninformation. For example, the well-docu-\\nmented role of personal influence in ac-\\ncepting innovations can be interpreted as\\ndue to a perceived high reliability of such\\ninformation; in economic terms, this means\\nmore information per unit of expenditure\\nof time or money.\\nThe terms of trade with the outside\\nworld should not be regarded as freely\\ngiven to the firm. In a world with a large\\nnumber of commodities, even knowing the\\nprices of relevant commodities involves\\nthe costly acquisition of certain kinds of\\ninformation. This remark has given rise\\nto a large literature on search in recent\\nyears. One implication which has been\\nonly slightly explored is that the concept\\nof the market begins to weaken, and\\nJevons's Law of Indifference becomes\\nmore of an equilibrium condition than a\\nstatement valid about a market even in\\ndisequilibrium. At a moment of time,\\nprices of what would usually be thought of\\nas the same commodity bought or sold by\\ndifferent firms can differ because buyers or\\nsellers may not, in their ignorance and in\\nthe presence of costs of search, find it\\nworthwhile to shop further. Obviously, the\\nimportant application of this principle\\nmay be to the labor market. Clearly, there\\nare important informational differences\\nbetween the employees currently working\\nfor a firm and potential substitutes else-\\nwhere, although these are interchangeable\\nin pure neoclassical theory. Indeed, there\\nare differences both in the information the\\nfirm possesses about its employees as com-\\npared with alternatives and the informa-\\ntion which employees have about the eco-\\nnomic opportunities and the specific pro-\\nduction conditions of the firm as compared\\nwith outsiders. It appears that considera-\\ntions of this type must play some role in\\nunderstanding the continued possibility of\\nunemployment and particularly the slug-\\ngish response of wages to market dis-\\nequilibria.\\nI am far from exhausting the implica-\\ntions of an information-economical view-\\npoint for the economic world.

One such oc-\\ncasion was the White House \"summit con-\\nference\" on inflation last September. Two\\ndozen leading economists from across a\\nwide spectrum of American economics\\n(not wide enough, the radicals would say)\\nsigned a statement which called on the\\nPresident and Congress to eliminate\\ntwenty-two restrictive laws and practices\\nthat inhibit competition, inflate costs, and\\nprop up prices.

Even more\\nstriking, in a sense, was that while the\\ncustomary and largely ideological clashes\\namong, say, Galbraith, Milton Friedman,\\nand Paul Samuelson caught the public\\neye, the real story lay in the minimal dis-\\nsent among the participants on (a) the\\nforecast of a soggy or sagging economy,\\n(b) the urgency of providing relief to the\\nvictims of inflation and the casualties of\\nrecession, (c) the need to ease monetary\\nrestraint, (d) the small anti-inflationary\\npayoff on moderate ($5 to $10 billion)\\nbudget cuts, and (e) the advisability of\\nresisting popular demands for reimposing\\nfull-scale wage and price controls.\\nThree, even where disagreement flour-\\nishes most visibly, perhaps, between\\nKeynesians and monetarists-the public\\nmay not discern that the analytical and\\nempirical ties that bind us are far stronger\\nthan the forces that divide us.

The \"Outputs\" of Public Economics\\nHaving considered some indicators of\\nthe quality of our inputs and of the re-\\nvealed preferences for our outputs, let me\\ncontinue this exercise in casual (andcon-\\ngenial) empiricism by taking an unscien-\\ntific but not unrepresentative sample of\\nthe outputs of economics, especially those\\nbearing on policy. For this purpose, I\\ndraw on my chosen field of public finance,\\nor public economics, to illustrate the telling\\nconceptual and empirical advances of\\neconomics in recent decades and the result-\\ning enrichment of its offerings to the policy\\nmaker. Indeed; such an appraisal offers so\\nmany healthy antidotes to \"what\\'s wrong\\nwith economics\" that I was tempted to\\ndevote my whole discourse to it tonight.\\nBut I resisted the temptation because,\\nfirst, much of it has already been done in\\ncarefully documented depth in survey\\nvolumes by Brookings and the National\\nBureau;2 second, I figured it might test\\nyour patience and mine; and third, it\\nwould have left no room for a confronta-\\ntion with inflation. So I offer instead a\\nminiaturized assessment of the achieve-\\nments of public economics as viewed\\nthrough the policy prism.\\nPublic Expenditures\\nConsider first the striking contributions\\neconomics has made in the past generation\\nto clear thinking and better informed\\ndecisions on public expenditures. Partly,\\nthis reflects advances in economic science,\\nfor example, in the theory of public goods\\nand human capital, and partly, creative\\nnew applications of the economist\\'s char-\\nacteristic way of looking at problems of\\nchoice, namely, through the lens of op-\\nportunity costs, benefits, and alternative\\npaths to a stated goal.\\nEconomics can offer much more con-\\ncrete guidance on efficient ways of allocat-\\ning resources to achieve stated govern-\\nmental objectives than it can on what the\\npublic-private sector division of resources\\nshould be. That may be a good thing in\\nthat presidents and congressmen view the\\nfixing of goals for public health, housing,\\nwelfare, and the like as what they were\\nelected for, yet at the same time seek, or\\nat least accept, economic guidance on the\\nchoice among competing methods of\\nachieving these goals.\\nNonetheless, rapid progress in the\\ntheory of public goods since the appear-\\nance of the Samuelson classic on \"The\\nPure Theory of Public Expenditures\" just\\ntwenty years ago has vastly improved on\\nthe simplistic theory it replaced. It has\\nfacilitated straight thinking on the deriva-\\ntion of conditions for efficient public-sector\\nallocations from private evaluations and\\non the articulation of social priorities\\nthrough the political process.\\nInterwoven with the newer thinking\\nabout public goods has been a resurgent\\ninterest in externalities or spillover effects.\\nIn a sense, the pure collective good is a\\ncase of total externality-all of its bene-\\nfits are external and nonmarketable since\\nnobody can be excluded from them. That\\nmay clarify thinking but gives little policy\\nguidance.\\nYet, the externality concept translates\\ninto hard-headed policy advice in such\\ndisparate areas as pollution, federal aid,\\nand the law. When pollution became a\\nnational concern, economists quickly drew\\non their tool kit to develop proposals for\\nantipollution taxes (within the context of  2 See Alan Blinder and Robert Solow et al.

An important rationale for\\nfederal grants flows from these externali-\\nties, namely, that to get local units to\\nproduce enough education and health\\nservice to achieve a national, not just a\\nlocal, cost-benefit optimum requires con-\\nditional grants from the federal purse.\\nFurther, since externalities in the form\\nof damage to third parties lies at the heart\\nof many problems in legal justice, eco-\\nnomics is able to make an important con-\\ntribution in this area.\\nWhen we turn to the empirical outputs\\nthat are now illuminating problems of\\npublic choice, we find the past decade\\nbristling with new thinking, new tech-\\nniques, and new measurements. These\\noffer the decision maker important new\\nguides in the seJection and evaluation of\\ngovernment programs and new insights\\ninto alternative systems of delivering\\ngovernment services:\\nMeasurement of cost-benefit ratios\\nhas developed from the early metrics\\nof water projects into, first, a sophisti-\\ncated cost-benefit calculus for tangible\\ninvestments like dams, roads, pollution-\\ncontrol projects and, second, cost-bene-\\nfit estimates for intangible investments\\nin human brainpower, skills, and health.\\nShadow pricing has been one of the use-\\nful tools in this connection.

The former\\ncriteria centered on the question: Is the\\nprogram put into effect quickly and with\\nhigh fidelity to the congressional intent?\\nNow, the accountability question is:\\nDoes it deliver the goods? Does it ac-\\ncomplish the objectives? Inputs used to\\nbe stressed if they conformed with the\\nintent of the legislation, they tended to\\nbe judged a success. But now we try to\\nmeasure outputs, a tougher and more\\nelusive standard.

The property tax provides a particu-\\nlarly instructive case in point. The text-\\nbooks of the 1930\\'s and 1940\\'s told us con-\\nfidently that the tax on land (fixed supply)\\nwas capitalized and on dwellings (supply-\\nresponsive) fell like an excise tax on the\\noccupant, the consumer of housing ser-\\nvices. The policy lesson was clear: Given\\nthe declining proportion of income spent\\non housing services as income rises, the\\ntax was hopelessly regressive. Today? It is\\nrecognized that the old incidence analysis\\nwas wrong, even on its own terms.\\nThe modern theory of incidence (de-\\nfined as the impact on distribution of\\nprivate real income) draws on general\\nequilibrium theory, distinguishes between\\nsources-of-income and uses-of-income ef-\\nfects, and disentangles the concepts of\\nspecific, differential, and balanced-budget\\nincidence. The resulting analysis indicates\\nthat much, of the aggregate burden of the\\nproperty tax falls on owners of capital\\nand hence tends to be progressive and\\nthis progressivity is enhanced by the\\nparticular \"excise-type\" effects of this\\ntax (Henry Aaron). In short, error has\\nbeen exposed and though the debate is not\\nover, we are now in transit toward truth.3\\nIt is hard to put down the knee-jerk reac-\\ntion that prefixes \"property tax\" with\\n\"regressive.\" And it will take some time\\nbefore policy makers accept the proposi-\\ntion that, at the very least, the property\\ntax is now in the unexpected position of\\n\"innocent until proved guilty.\" But the\\nimplications for policy are profound.\\nEconomists have long been useful and\\ninfluential contributors to the design of the\\nfederal tax structure and of particular\\ntaxes.

And it has been discussed in the\\nstabilization theory and policy literature,\\nin congressional hearings, and in other\\npolicy forums ever since.\\nThis country finally embraced activist\\nfiscal policies for full employment in the\\n1960\\'s, most explicitly in the 1964 tax cut.\\nFollowing the canons of Keynesian eco-\\nnomics, focussing on the economy\\'s full\\nemployment potential as their target, and\\nsteadfastly rejecting a spate of \"struc-\\ntural\" explanations of unemployment,\\neconomists were at first alone in prescrib-\\ning tax cuts as a tonic for the stagnant\\neconomy. Enacted early in 1964, the tax\\ncut delivered the promised expansion and\\nbudget balance without inflation. By\\nAugust 1965, when Vietnam escalation\\nbegan, unemployment had been brought\\nto 4.4 percent with only the faintest stir-\\nring of the inflationary beast (i.e., with\\nconsumer prices rising at less than a 2 per-\\ncent annual rate).\\nIn a very real sense, economists have\\nbeen victims of their own success.

Yet on the other hand, success bred\\ngreat expectations on the part of the public\\nthat economics could deliver prosperity\\nwithout inflation and with ever-growing\\nmaterial gains in the bargain. The message\\ngot through that we had \"harnessed the\\nexisting economics . . . to the purposes of\\nprosperity, stability, and growth,\" and\\nthat as to the role of the tax cut in break-\\ning old molds of thinking, \"nothing suc-\\nceeds like success\" (Heller).

In a close parallel with research on\\ncancer, economists are working on various\\npieces of the inflation puzzle and produc-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'ing useful insights and guidance for policy\\npurposes. But as economists, we would be\\nthe first to underscore that these puzzles\\nare far from being fitted into an articulated\\nand holistic theory of inflation. Inflation-\\nary analysis appears as an appendage to\\nKeynesian and monetarist theories. But\\nas yet, the Keynesian apparatus cannot\\ntell us how any given change in aggregate\\ndemand is divided between changes in\\nreal output and changes in prices. Nor has\\nmonetarist theory unlocked the puzzle of\\nhow the effects of monetary changes are\\ndivided between output and price level\\nchanges. And no big breakthrough is in\\nsight.\\nDoes this mean that the economist has\\nto stand mute in the meanwhile? Not at\\nall. He is pushing ahead on the various\\npieces of basic research on the cancer of\\ninflation and isolating and prescribing\\neffectively for particular forms of the\\ncancer even without having a complete\\nexplanation of the disease. Let me come\\nback to the sustained and systematic re-\\nsearch efforts on endemic inflation after\\nexamining the 1973-74 epidemic and the\\neconomist\\'s responses to it. Since the\\nepidemic is an over-layer on the endemic\\nbase, the distinctions won\\'t be clear-cut-\\nbut they are nonetheless useful for viewing\\nwhat the economist is able to contribute\\nto policy.\\nThe food-fuel price bulge generated over\\nhalf of the 1973-74 inflation-and of\\neconomists\\' woes as well. Yet, it is asking\\na lot of economists to expect them to have\\nforeseen that the oil cartel would quad-\\nruple oil prices, that the world would suffer\\nwidespread and successive crop failures,\\nthat the Peruvian anchovies would go into\\nhiding, and that the Soviets would \"solve\\nour surplus grain problem\" overnight.\\nSeveral unpleasant policy surprises also\\nbeset the inflation forecasters. First, just\\nwhen a new rash of inflation was breaking\\nout early in 1973, the reasonably effective\\nPhase II controls were abruptly dropped\\nin favor of the weak and ineffective Phase\\nIII. Second, six months later, after infla-\\ntion had changed into a commodity-driven\\nstructural phenomenon involving a drastic\\nreadjustment of relative prices, the White\\nHouse (to the pained surprise of econo-\\nmists inside and outside the administra-\\ntion) prescribed just the wrong medicine,\\na new wage-price freeze. A third policy\\nsurprise was that the dollar was allowed\\nto sink like a stone: At its low point in the\\nsummer of 1973 (just before a substantial\\nrebound), relative prices of imports had\\nrisen 10 percent in six months. About a\\nquarter of the 1973 inflation has been at-\\ntributed to these policy developments\\n(see William Nordhaus and John Shoven).\\nIt is worth noting that unexpected\\ntwists and turns of federal policy which\\nmight be termed \"internal shocks\" in\\ncontrast with the \"external shocks\" of the\\nfood-fuel price explosion-are a continuing\\nbane of the forecaster\\'s existence. The\\nabout-face of the Federal Reserve in 1974\\nis another painful case in point. The sharp\\nturn from ease to tightness in the first\\nquarter of the year was a major factor in\\ntransforming prospects of recovery into\\nrecession in the second half of 1974. It is\\nnot quite clear why economists should be\\nbetter at anticipating these shocks, es-\\npecially the external ones, than society as\\na whole, or other professional specialists,\\nor practical men of the world. Nothing in\\nstatistical methodology or economic sci-\\nence enables us to predict random shocks.\\nWhat can be expected of us is that when\\nthey occur, we will spot them quickly,\\nidentify them, and analyze their signifi-\\ncance for policy.\\nIt is also worth remembering that\\ndemocratic governments, by their nature,\\nare pressure-responders rather than prob-\\nlem-anticipators. This carries two implica-\\ntions for political economists. On one\\nhand, if an idea\\'s time has not yet come,\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

On the other, spotting\\nemergent problems early can perhaps\\nhasten an idea\\'s time and alert the policy\\nmakers to impending danger.\\nEconomists can more readily be faulted\\nfor being caught by surprise by the short-\\nages of materials and primary processing\\ncapacity that caused the economy to\\nbump against its ceiling sooner than ex-\\npected and by the worldwide economic\\nboom that put severe pressure on raw\\ncommodity supplies and prices. On the\\nfirst point, we suffered both from informa-\\ntion failure-the official capacity indexes\\nsimply did not reveal how close the econ-\\nomy was to its output ceilings-and from\\nanalytic limits. While identifying the\\ncauses, economists have been unable to\\npinpoint the relative significance of the\\nshortfall of investment that began in the\\nlate 1960\\'s, of underinvestment caused by\\nprice controls, of delays induced by en-\\nvironmental policies, and of the surge in\\nforeign demand touched off by devalua-\\ntion. However, I should add that the\\nshortages problem is meat and drink for\\neconomists, and they are responding (es-\\npecially in the energy field) with new\\nanalyses of price elasticities, investment\\nneeds, and the like. All of a sudden, price\\ntheory is back in vogue, and elasticities\\nhave replaced multipliers as the badge of a\\npolicy maker\\'s savoir faire.\\nDelays in perceiving that the U.S. eco-\\nnomic expansion was part of a worldwide\\nupsurge can again be laid more to lack of\\nan adequate information system than to\\nany inability to understand the underly-\\ning principles. Still, a better sense of his-\\ntory and of the emerging worldwide im-\\nbalance between growing aspirations and\\ngrowing incomes on one hand and inelastic\\nresource supply and lagging technology\\non the other would have made us more\\nconscious and cautious. We are consider-\\nably less likely to be caught by surprise in\\nthe future in view of the new worldwide\\ndata networks that are being developed by\\nProject LINK at the University of Penn-\\nsylvania and by Otto Eckstein and his\\ncolleagues at Data Resources Incorporated\\n(DRJ).\\nWithout absolving economists, one\\nshould apply this operational test: With\\nproper foresight, would tighter monetary\\nand budget policy have been able to\\ndamp inflation? It is worth recalling, first,\\nthat the full employment budget was\\nmaking a swing of over $10 billion towards\\nrestraint between fiscal 1973 and fiscal\\n1974 (from a $2 billion deficit to a $10\\nbillion surplus under the old 4 percent un-\\nemployment standard) and that monetary\\npolicy pushed interest rates into the\\ndouble-digit region; second, that there was\\nlittle that an aggregate demand squeeze\\ncould have done to push world commodity\\nprices down. So the answer is clear: Even\\ntougher fiscal and monetary policy would\\nhave had limited scope in holding inflation\\ndown.\\nThis is not to deny that generating a\\nlarger full employment surplus would\\nhave been the prudent course in calendar\\n1973. But it is worth noting that to offset\\nthe food and fuel price explosions-which\\nwere triggered by forces largely immune to\\nU.S. fiscal and monetary policy-would\\nhave required a reduction of 3 percent in\\nall other prices. Such a target implies de-\\npression-inducing doses of fiscal and mone-\\ntary restriction, an unthinkable \"solu-\\ntion.\"\\nLooking toward the future, many econo-\\nmists draw the lesson not that one should\\nkeep the economy\\'s motor idling,\\' but\\nrather that one should provide it with\\nsafety devices and heavy-duty shock ab-\\nsorbers, for example, stock-piling of food-\\nstuffs, oil, and basic raw materials, careful\\ntracking of commodity exports, distant\\nearly warning systems to spot shortages-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

In other\\nwords, it is a call for better planning,\\nbetter data, and faster conversion of\\nknowledge into policy.\\nAnother criterion of economists\\' re-\\nsponses to inflationary shocks is how\\nquickly they adapted (read, \"disaggre-\\ngated\") their macromodels, large and\\nsmall, to incorporate new supply and price\\nparameters that had previously been\\njudged of second or third order importance\\nand hence relegated to Marshall\\'s ceteris\\nparibus pound. Some of the mongrel pups\\nimpounded there turned out to be full\\nblooded huskies, for example, food prices,\\nthe exchange value of the dollar, oil and\\nother raw material supplies and prices. At\\nfirst most economists were slow and the big\\nmodels sluggish in their responses. After\\nall, for two decades prices had moved in\\ntandem with wages, with a year-by-year\\npercentage-point differential of 23+ 1. So\\nmost models relied on wage trends, with\\nsome adjustment for productivity and\\ncapacity behavior, to give them a fix on\\nprice trends. Their eyes were on labor\\nmarket indicators rather than commodity\\nsupplies, exchange rates, and the like.\\nAfter some initial delays, the model build-\\ners scrambled to disaggregate, to build\\nmicroelements into their macromodels.\\nFor example, DRI now has good stage-of-\\nprocessing models that absorb the impacts\\nof food and energy explosions. Price elas-\\nticities are being built into the macro-\\nmodels to reflect the impact of massive\\nrelative price changes on the macrodimen-\\nsions of the economy.\\nThe whole experience reminds us of the\\nrole and limits of econometric forecasting\\nmodels. First, the combination of com-\\nputers, mathematics, and econometrics\\ncannot produce the miracles that the un-\\ninitiated may expect of them-there is no\\nway of replicating reality with its 3 million\\nequations, all of them non-linear. Second,\\ntheir indispensable function is to bring us\\ncloser to reality and help the mind manage\\nthe previously unmanageable-they per-\\nmit us to release vastly more animals from\\nthe ceteris paribus pound than we could\\nmanage without these tools. Third, they\\nhave to be constantly adjusted to plug in\\ncommon sense, adjust the length of the\\nlags, and bring in new dimensions of the\\nproblem. Else, they will lock out things\\nthat a more judgmental approach would\\ninclude, and will fail to respond quickly to\\nchanges in order of importance.\\nSo the inflation-shock experience has\\nbrought home the need not just to watch\\nsupply but to watch all the pieces lest the\\nmodel prevail over the mind, rather than\\nhaving the model help the mind prevail\\nover matter. The macro-stalactites have\\nto reach toward the micro-stalagmites, and\\nvice versa. I hope that metaphor is not a\\nportent of the pace at which the advance\\ntoward macro-micro fusion will proceed.\\nEconomists who use judgmental models\\nhave shown us how to be the master\\nrather than the slave of the computer. A\\ncase in point was the early analysis (es-\\npecially by George Perry) of the macro-\\nimpact of the oil price increases. A year\\nago, his work had already brought out the\\noil paradox-the inflation of costs and\\nhence prices, leading to a deflation of ag-\\ngregate demand-and had provided some\\nestimates of both. The insight that some\\n$15 to $20 billion of consumer purchasing\\npower would be siphoned off into the\\nhands of oil producers and royalty col-\\nlectors without any early return to the\\neconomy in the form of demand for im-\\nports or investment goods had important\\nimplications for demand-management pol-\\nicy-implications that were ignored until\\nsevere recession was full upon us.7\\n\\n###',\n",

Having put the Great Depression\\nof the 1930\\'s far behind us, will we there-\\nfore have to live with the Great Inflation\\nof the 1970\\'s?\\nEssentially, the economist answers that,\\ngiven the ratchet behavior of wages and\\nprices, the price level can only float up-\\nward to accommodate the massive relative\\nprice increases of oil, grains, certain raw\\nmaterials, and imported goods. These\\nsharp changes in the composition of supply\\ntouch off reverberating price increases\\nthroughout the economy as prices in the\\nscarce-supply sectors become costs in the\\nless-scarce ones. The reverberations go on\\n-in substantial part independent of the\\nstate of aggregate demand and hence of\\nmonetary and fiscal policy-until the\\nprices of the initiating goods have risen\\nsufficiently farther than prices in general\\nto accomplish the necessary realignment\\nof relative prices. This is the process going\\non now. It takes time, but not forever. It\\nhas much to do with double-digit inflation,\\nbut it does not condemn us to Weimar\\nRepublic inflation.\\nSolow (1975) reminds us that the sup-\\nply-shift phenomenon bears a close rela-\\ntionship to the demand-shift analysis of\\nthe creeping inflation of the mid-1950\\'s.\\nAt that time, the parallel process was\\ntouched off by an investment boom that\\nput excess demand pressures on capital\\ngoods industries even when there was no\\nexcess aggregate demand in the economy.\\nGiven the downward rigidity and cost-\\noriented nature of wages and prices in\\nareas of excess market power, the price\\nlevel had to float upward to accommodate\\nthose relative price changes (see Schultze\\n(1959)).\\nJohn Dunlop and other economists have\\nemphasized that there is a closely related\\nphenomenon on the wage side known as\\n\"scale wages\" or \"wage relativities\" or\\neven a \"just wage\" (see Robert Hall and\\nMichael Piore). If the relative wage scale\\nis thrown out of kilter by an outsized\\nwage settlement in one industry, the others\\nwill writhe, twist, and turn until the old\\nrelationships are reestablished.

Can the economist tell him\\nanything useful and definitive on this\\nsubject? Useful, perhaps. Definitive, no.\\nFirst, the economist would remind him\\nthat people continually blame inflation for\\ncrimes it does not commit. They are sure\\nthat every increase in their pay envelope\\nis a reward for merit, every increase in\\nprices an inflationary theft. Especially\\npertinent to our present shock-spiral is\\nthe observation that people \"blame infla-\\ntion for changes in relative prices and in\\nreal incomes that stem from market forces\\nthat have nothing to do with the course of\\nthe general price level\" (Edward Foster).\\nSecond, studies show that in a typical\\nU.S. inflation, the poor have gained more\\nin jobs and incomes than they have lost in\\nhigher prices. But in the present inflation,\\nprices have shifted sharply against the\\npoor, and any initial gains they may have\\nmade in jobs and income in 1973 have been\\nmore than offset by the losses incurred in\\nthe deepening 1974-75 recession induced\\nto fight inflation.\\nThird, at the rates of inflation experi-\\nenced prior to the 1973-75 explosion, most\\neconomists find it difficult to believe that\\nthe costs of inflation-mostly in redis-\\ntributional effects, but with some distor-\\ntion in resource allocation-hold a candle\\nto the welfare losses of substantial add-ons\\nto unemployment. Fourth, however, when\\ninflation reaches double-digit levels, the\\ncosts in terms of the social conflicts and\\ntensions it generates and the uncertainties\\nand loss of confidence in the dollar yard-\\nstick it may breed are important intangi-\\nbles that economists cannot ignore, yet\\nhave not been able to quantify. We need\\nto understand far more about what un-\\nsettles and upsets people about inflation,\\nhow this affects their economic behavior,\\nand what economic costs result. Clearly,\\nin an economy where inflation is endemic,\\nthe balance between its gains and losses\\ndeserves intensive further study.\\nAnother important question is this:\\nHow much of the present run-up in prices\\nof foodstuffs, oil, and raw materials is a\\ntransitory phenomenon, how much is a\\none-time shift to a new plateau, and how\\nmuch represents a new upward trend?\\nEconomists have trained the guns of price\\ntheory and price elasticity estimation on\\nthese questions in the case of oil and sev-\\neral other basic materials. They generally\\ncome up with more optimistic answers\\nfor five to ten years hence than for the\\nnear-term. But much of the answer lies\\nin geo-political, meteorological, and simi-\\nlar puzzles-for example, the effective-\\nness of oil and other raw material cartels,\\nthe pace of world population increases\\nand income growth, and the possibility of\\na dry, cold phase in world weather-that\\nlie largely or wholly beyond the reach of\\neconomic analysis.\\nWhat we do know is this: The 1950\\'s\\nand the 1960\\'s were a period of gently de-\\nclining or roughly stable world prices for\\nraw materials or foodstuffs. Now, rising\\npopulation, industrialization, income, and\\naspirations may put such pressure on the\\nworld\\'s supply capabilities that while we\\nare not nearing any Club-of-Rome ulti-\\nmate limits, we may for some time exceed\\nthe speed limits of stable expansion.

       " 'The title of this paper summarizes the\\ntwo-fold theme to which I want to address\\nmyself this evening. First, the mainstream\\nof economic theory sacrifices far too much\\nrelevance in its insistent pursuit of ever\\nincreasing rigor. And, second, we econo-\\nmists pay too little attention to the chang-\\ning institutional environment that condi-\\ntions economic behavior. We do not often\\nenough reexamine our basic postulates in\\nlight of changes in this environment, and,\\nperhaps more important, we shy away\\nfrom the big questions about how and why\\nthe institutional structure is changing-\\nand where it is taking us.\\'\\nI\\nEconomists pride themselves on belong-\\ning to the most \"scientific\" of the social\\nsciences. The justification for this conten-\\ntion lies in the growing resemblance be-\\ntween the nature of the analytical tools\\nused in economics and in the natural\\nsciences-above all, the increasing use of\\nmathematical tools in theoretical analysis\\nand the development of sophisticated\\nmathematical and statistical techniques in\\nempirical work. Today, mathematically\\nformulated economic theory, the develop-\\nment of econometric techniques, and the\\nsophisticated application of econometric\\nmethods to the \"testing of hypotheses\" in\\na variety of applied fields constitute the\\ncore of the science of economics.2\\nWhat is science? One brief definition\\nruns: \"A systematic knowledge of the\\nphysical or material world.\" Most defini-\\ntions emphasize the two elements in this\\ndefinition: (1) \"systematic knowledge\"\\nabout (2) the real world. Without pushing\\nthis definitional question to its metaphysi-\\ncal limits, I merely want to suggest that if\\neconomics is to be a science, it must not\\nonly develop analytical tools but must also\\napply them to a world that is now observ-\\nable or that can be made observable\\nthrough improved methods of observation\\nand measurement. Or in the words of the\\nHungarian mathematical economist J\\'anos\\nKornai, \"In the real sciences, the criterion\\nis not whether the proposition is logically\\ntrue and tautologically deducible from\\nearlier assumptions. The criterion of \\'truth\\'\\nis, whether or not the proposition corre-\\nsponds to reality\" (p. 9, his italics). (Com-\\npare Wassily Leontief 1966, p. 23.)\\nOne of our most distinguished historians\\nof economic thought, George Stigler, has\\nstated that: \"The dominant influence upon\\nthe working range of economic theorists is\\nthe set of internal values and pressures of\\n\\n\\n###',\n",
       " 'conomics-1976-0-04.tx',\n",
       " 'the discipline. The subjects of study are\\nposed by the unfolding course of scientific\\ndevelopments\" (p. 22). He goes on to add:\\n\"This is not to say that the environment is\\nwithout influence...... \"But, he continues,\\n\"whether a fact or development is signifi-\\ncant depends primarily on its relevance to\\ncurrent economic theory\" (p. 23). (Com-\\npare Tjalling Koopmans, p. 170.) What a\\ncurious relating of rigor to relevance!\\nWhether the real world matters depends\\npresumably on \"its relevance to current\\neconomic theory.\" Many if not most of to-\\nday\\'s economic theorists seem to agree\\nwith this ordering of priorities.3\\nTo what aspects of the observable world\\ndoes economics apply its analytical tools?\\nAccording to the familiar definition in the\\nInternational Encyclopedia of the Social\\nSciences, which we owe originally to Lionel\\nRobbins, economics \"is the study of the\\nallocation of scarce resources among un-\\nlimited and competing uses.\" To this defi-\\nnition of microeconomics the Encyclo-\\npedia then rather weakly adds macroeco-\\nnomics, which is defined as the study of\\nmoney, the general price level, and the\\nlevel of output and employment.\\nLet us consider the microeconomic part\\nof this definition. Presumably the reference\\nis to real resources, used to produce ob-\\nservable goods and services, that are ex-\\nchanged and consumed by real people liv-\\ning in the kind of world we see around us.\\nOf course, some degree of abstraction is\\nnecessary if useful generalizations are to be\\nreached. Here the economic theorist quickly\\nruns up against a dilemma. Shall he seek to\\nmake his analysis ever more rigorous, re-\\ngardless of the possibly diminishing rele-\\nvance of his conclusions to the observed\\nworld? Or shall he sacrifice elegant refine-\\nment for somewhat cruder analysis that\\nmay lead to testable results? I suppose the\\nreply can be given that we need to do both\\nand that we need specialists in each of\\nthese approaches. But certainly those who\\nconstruct the analytical apparatus should\\npay more attention than many of them\\nnow do to the substantive problems with\\nwhich economists are presumably con-\\ncerned.4\\nIn speaking of how well current micro-\\neconomic theory combines rigor and rele-\\nvance, I should distinguish among the\\ndifferent but interrelated problem areas\\nwith which this part of economic theory\\nconcerns itself. Micro theory addresses it-\\nself primarily to three related topics: (1)\\nthe conditions necessary for, and the means\\nof actually achieving, an optimum alloca-\\ntion of resources within decision-making\\nunits, both firms and households, under\\ngiven assumptions as to the criteria of op-\\ntimization; (2) again under given assump-\\ntions, the conditions necessary for the\\nexistence of a general (or partial) equilib-\\nrium among all (or some) of these decision-\\nmaking units, including the determination\\nof the uniqueness and stability of such an\\nequilibrium; and (3) the conditions re-\\nquired for the achievement of an economic\\noptimum from a broad, social point of\\nview.\\nSome success has been achieved in blend-\\ning rigor and relevance in the theory of the\\nsingle decision-making unit. Certainly, as\\nthis year\\'s Nobel prize in economics attests,\\nconsiderable progress has been achieved in\\ndealing with production planning in the\\nindividual firm or establishment (or gov-\\nernment department) for which mathe-\\nmatical tools, including programming and\\nthe whole range of activity analysis, have\\nproved to be useful.

I do not wish to minimize\\nthe value of this work. But we should not\\nignore the extent to which rigorous formu-\\nlations of the theory of the firm have had\\nto be relaxed in order to obtain useful re-\\nsults in empirical work. Nor, I might add,\\nshould we forget the extent to which con-\\nventional theory ignores how and why\\nwork is organized within the firm and\\nestablishment in the way that it is, what\\nmay be called the \"social relations\" of the\\nproduction process.\\nSome success in blending rigor and rele-\\nvance has also been achieved in the field of\\nhousehold behavior-ranging from studies\\nof the determinants of consumers\\' demand\\nto recent work on human capital, the be-\\nhavior of labor markets, the economics of\\ncrime, and the like. I must confess to some\\nskepticism, however, about the relevance\\nof the economic models of household be-\\nhavior recently developed by Gary Becker\\nand his followers-what has been referred\\nto as \"the new home economics.\" Granted\\nthat much useful work has been done in\\nthis area. Nonetheless there is a lamentable\\ntendency among scholars in this field to\\nrely upon a caricature of human beings\\nwho continuously and consciously balance\\ncosts and benefits at the margin, whether\\nin deciding on another year of schooling,\\nwhether and when to marry or be divorced,\\nhow many children to have and when, or\\nwhether and when to commit a crime. And\\nafter a substantial amount of intensive re-\\nsearch, the human capital approach still\\nleaves unexplained a significant part of the\\ndifferences in personal incomes.\\nIn the second area mentioned, particu-\\nlarly general equilibrium theory, it seems\\nto me that relevance has been largely ab-\\nsent in the recent literature. To find much\\nrelevance at the theoretical level, and I\\nrefer here only to the theoretical literature,\\nwe must go back to the partial-equilibrium\\nanalysis of Alfred Marshall and his fol-\\nlowers. Walras, Pareto, and their succes-\\nsors-with their assumptions of atomistic\\ncompetition, perfectly flexible prices, cost-\\nless information, and limitless futures mar-\\nkets-have contributed little to relevance\\nin their steadfast pursuit of rigor. Although\\na step in the right direction, recent at-\\ntempts to develop a pure theory of dis-\\nequilibrium are subject to much the same\\ncriticism.\\nRigor and relevance have been success-\\nfully blended in input-output analysis,\\nalthough largely at the expense of ignoring\\nthe price sensitivity of input-output co-\\nefficients. Here again, the emphasis is on\\nengineering-type relationships, but in this\\ncase the entire economy is the object of\\nstudy.\\nMicro-economic analysis, as I have noted,\\nconcerns itself with \"the allocation of\\nscarce resources among unlimited and com-\\npeting uses.\" As economists we are con-\\ncerned with how resources may be allo-\\ncated efficiently, and we are prepared to\\nprovide the layman and the policymaker\\nwith a rigorous definition of efficiency. But\\n\"efficient allocation\" for whose benefit? To\\nme it has always been startling that the\\naccepted province of micro-economic the-\\nory has little room for the personal dis-\\ntribution of income-and virtually none\\nfor the personal distribution of wealth. Of\\ncourse, we speak of \"distribution,\" but by\\nthis we mean either factor prices or total\\nfactor shares.\\nWhy wealth and labor services, the lat-\\nter carrying widely different market-deter-\\nmined prices, are distributed among differ-\\nent human beings in the way they actually\\nare is a question that the non-Marxian\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

(Compare Becker, p. 135.)\\nBut if the problem is so important, why\\nonly \"eventually\"? It is not surprising\\nthat many younger economists are seeking\\na radical alternative for the neoclassical\\nframework, more or less along Marxian\\nlines. And it is also this concern with the\\nunequal personal distribution of oppor-\\ntunity and income which has led to the\\ndevelopment of models of a dual labor mar-\\nket. These models, with their emphasis on\\ninstitutional barriers to labor mobility,\\noffer some valuable insights into the opera-\\ntion of contemporary labor markets, and\\nthey also raise important questions about\\nsome of the assumptions implicit in neo-\\nclassical theory.7\\nFrom the point of view of human wel-\\nfare-a concept that will not go away no\\nmatter how uncomfortable it makes the\\neconomic theorist-can we ignore the per-\\nsonal distribution of income?

What we today call macro-\\neconomics grew out of the catastrophe of\\nthe Great Depression,\\'0 and in the early\\ndevelopment of macro-economic analysis\\nrelevance took precedence over rigor. To-\\nday, rigor competes with relevance in\\nmacro-economic and monetary theory, and\\nin some lines of development macro and\\nmonetary theorists, like many of their col-\\nleagues in micro theory, seem to consider\\nrelevance to be more or less irrelevant. A\\ngood example has been the elaboration of\\nso-called growth theory Ahich now seems\\nto be losing some of its earlier popularity.\\nApparently, there has come to be a growing\\nrecognition that the considerable efforts\\nspent on growth models have not signifi-\\ncantly advanced knowledge beyond the\\ncontributions of the original Harrod-Domar\\nand the Solow-Swan neoclassical models.\\nAnd other intriguing topics have arisen to\\nstimulate the pursuit of rigor at the ex-\\npense of relevance.\\nIn both micro- and macroeconomics, ef-\\nforts are sometimes made to extract a drop\\nor two of relevance from exercises in ana-\\nlytical rigor; and conclusions are drawn\\nabout the functioning of some aspect of\\nthe real world, or policy recommendations\\nare made, on the basis of theoretical exer-\\ncises which rest on assumptions that fly in\\nthe face of the facts. One example is the\\nfrequent fitting of the neoclassical invest-\\nment function, with its built-in assump-\\ntions of constant returns and perfect com-\\npetition, to industries in which these as-\\nsumptions obviously do not hold. Another\\nexample is a good deal of the recent litera-\\nture seeking to reformulate the micro-\\neconomic foundations of macro-economic\\ntheory and policy-what Edmund Phelps\\n(1969, 1972) has termed \"The New Micro-\\neconomics in Inflation and Employment\\nTheory.\" The theoretical analysis in much\\nof this literature rests on assumptions that\\nalso fly in the face of the facts. To cite a\\nfew examples: all unemployment is a vol-\\nuntary activity as part of a search proce-\\ndure in which workers are continuously\\nequating costs and prospective benefits at\\nthe margin; the labor supply is typically\\ntaken to be homogeneous with perfect mo-\\nbility among labor submarkets; so-called\\nstructural unemployment is ignored as are\\nthe striking differences in unemployment\\nrates among different age, sex, ethnic, and\\noccupational groups; and downward wage\\nflexibility is generally assumed, although\\nsome recent attempts have been made to\\nrelax this assumption. Another related re-\\ncent development in which theory pro-\\nceeds with impeccable logic from unrealis-\\ntic assumptions to conclusions that contra-\\ndict the historical record, is the recent\\nwork on rational expectations.

Over this same period, of\\ncourse, the character of actual markets has\\nbeen changing in many ways. While im-\\nprovements in transportation and com-\\nmunication have tended to promote com-\\npetition in expanding markets, the growth\\nof large firms and the spread of industrial\\nconcentration have made oligopoly a much\\nmore relevant model for industrial markets\\nthan the perfectly competitive model\\nwhich today\\'s theorists insist on using.

Some ex-\\nception to this generalization should be\\nmade for the considerable effort that has\\ngone into the study of the underdeveloped\\nparts of the world.

There are in reality\\nno serious analytical disagreements between\\nleading monetarists and leading nonmonetarists.\\nMilton Friedman was once quoted as saying,\\n\"We are all Keynesians, now,\" and I am quite\\nprepared to reciprocate that \"we are all mone-\\ntarists\\' \\'-if by morietarism is meant assigning to\\nthe stock of money a major role in determining\\noutput and prices. Indeed, the list of those who\\nhave long been monetarists in this sense is quite\\nextensive, including among other John May-\\nnard Keynes as well as myself, as is attested by\\nmy 1944 and 1963 articles.\\nIn reality the distinguishing feature of the\\nmonetarist school and the real issues of disagree-\\nment with nonmonetarists is not monetarism, but\\nrather the role that should probably be assigned\\nto stabilization policies. Nonmonetarists accept\\nwhat I regard to be the fundamental practical\\nmessage of The General Theory: that a private\\nenterprise economy using an intangible money\\nneeds to be stabilized, can be stabilized, and\\ntherefore should be stabilized by appropriate\\nmonetary and fiscal policies. Monetarists by\\ncontrast take the view that there is no serious\\nneed to stabilize the economy; that even if there\\nwere a need, it could not be done, for stabiliza-\\ntion policies would be more likely to increase\\nthan to decrease instability; and, at least some\\nmonetarists would, I believe, go so far as to hold\\nthat, even in the unlikely event that stabilization\\npolicies could on balance prove beneficial, the\\ngovernment should not be trusted with the neces-\\nsary power.\\nWhat has led me to address this controversy\\nis the recent spread of monetarism, both in a\\nsimplistic, superficial form and in the form of\\ngrowing influence on the practical conduct of\\neconomic policy, which influence, I shall argue\\npresently, has played at least some role in the\\neconomic upheavals of the last three years.\\nIn what follows then, I propose first to review\\nthe main arguments bearing on the need for\\nstabilization policies, that is, on the likely extent\\nof instability in the absence of such policies, and\\nthen to examine the issue of the supposed desta-\\nbilizing effect of pursuing stabilization policies.\\nMy main concern will be with instability gener-\\nated by the traditional type of disturbances-de-\\nmand shocks.

       " \"stabilization policies, as was brought out by the\\nearly interpreters of The General Theory (for\\nexample, John Hicks, the author, 1944), re-\\nsulted from the interaction of a basic contribu-\\ntion to traditional monetary theory-liquidity\\npreference-and an unorthodox hypothesis\\nabout the working of the labor market-com-\\nplete downward rigidity of wages.\\nBecause of liquidity preference, a change in\\naggregate demand, which may be broadly de-\\nfined as any event that results in a change in the\\nmarket clearing or equilibrium rate of interest,\\nwill produce a corresponding change in the real\\ndemand for money or velocity of circulation, and\\nhence in the real stock of money needed at full\\nemployment. As long as wages are perfectly\\nflexible, even with a constant nominal supply,\\nfull employment could and would be maintained\\nby a change of wages and prices as needed to\\nproduce the required change in the real money\\nsupply-though even in this case, stability of the\\nprice level would require a countercyclical mon-\\netary policy. But, under the Keynesian wage\\nassumption the classical adjustment through\\nprices can occur only in the case of an increased\\ndemand. In the case of a decline, instead, wage\\nrigidity prevents the necessary increase in the\\nreal money supply and the concomitant required\\nfall in interest rates. Hence, if the nominal\\nmoney supply is constant, the initial equilibrium\\nmust give way to a new stable one, characterized\\nby lower output and by an involuntary reduction\\nin employment, so labeled because it does not\\nresult from a shift in notional demand and supply\\nschedules in terms of real wages, but only from\\nan insufficient real money supply. The nature of\\nthis equilibrium is elegantly captured by the\\nHicksian IS-LM paradigm, which to our gener-\\nation of economists has become almost as fa-\\nmiliar as the demand-supply paradigm was to\\nearlier ones.\\nThis analysis implied that a fixed money sup-\\nply far from insuring approximate stability of\\nprices and output, as held by the traditional\\nview, would result in a rather unstable economy,\\nalternating between periods of protracted unem-\\nployment and stagnation, and bursts of inflation.\\nThe extent of downward instability would de-\\npend in part on the size of the exogenous shocks\\nto demand and in part on the strength of what\\nmay be called the Hicksian mechanism. By this\\nI mean the extent to which a shift in IS, through\\nits interaction with LM, results in some decline\\nin interest rates and thus in a change in income\\nwhich is smaller than the original shift. The sta-\\nbilizing power of this mechanism is controlled\\nby various parameters of the system. In par-\\nticular, the economy will be more unstable\\nthe greater the interest elasticity of demand for\\nmoney, and the smaller the interest responsive-\\nness of aggregate demand. Finally, a large\\nmultiplier is also destabilizing in that it implies\\na larger shift in IS for a given shock.\\nHowever, the instability could be readily\\ncounteracted by appropriate stabilization poli-\\ncies. Monetary policy could change the nominal\\nsupply of money so as to accommodate the\\nchange in real demand resulting from shocks in\\naggregate demand. Fiscal policy, through ex-\\npenditure and taxes, could offset these shocks,\\nmaking full employment consistent with the\\ninitial nominal money stock. In general, both\\nmonetary and fiscal policies could be used in\\ncombination. But because of a perceived uncer-\\ntainty in the response of demand to changes in\\ninterest rates, and because changes in interest\\nrates through monetary policy could meet diffi-\\nculties and substantial delays related to expec-\\ntations (so-called liquidity traps), fiscal policy\\nwas regarded as having some advantages.\\nB. The Early Keynesians\\nThe early disciples of the new Keynesian\\ngospel, still haunted by memories of the Great\\nDepression, frequently tended to outdo Keynes'\\npessimism about potential instability. Concern\\nwith liquidity traps fostered the view that the de-\\nmand for money was highly interest elastic;\\nfailure to distinguish between the short- and\\nlong-run marginal propensity to save led to over-\\nestimating the long-run saving rate, thereby\\nfostering concern with stagnation, and to under-\\nestimating the short-run propensity, thereby\\nexaggerating the short-run multiplier.

       " 'rates were supposed to affect, at best, the de-\\nmand for long-lived fixed investments, and the\\ninterest elasticity was deemed to be low. Thus,\\nshocks were believed to produce a large re-\\nsponse. Finally, investment demand was seen as\\ncapriciously controlled by \"animal spirits,\"\\nthus providing an important source of shocks.\\nAll this justified calling for very active stabiliza-\\ntion policies. Furthermore, since the very\\ncircumstances which produce a large response to\\ndemand shocks also produce a large response to\\nfiscal and a small response to monetary actions,\\nthere was a tendency to focus on fiscal policy as\\nthe main tool to keep the economy at near full\\nemployment.\\nC. The Phillips Curve\\nIn the two decades following The General\\nTheory, there were a number of developments of\\nthe Keynesian system including dynamization of\\nthe model, the stress on taxes versus expendi-\\ntures and the balanced budget multiplier, and the\\nfirst attempts at estimating the critical param-\\neters through econometric techniques and mod-\\nels. But for present purposes, the most important\\none was the uncovering of a \"stable\" statistical\\nrelation between the rate of change of wages and\\nthe rate of unemployment, which has since come\\nto be known as the Phillips curve. This relation,\\nand its generalization by Richard Lipsey to allow\\nfor the effect of recent inflation, won wide ac-\\nceptance even before an analytical underpinning\\ncould be provided for it, in part because it could\\naccount for the \"puzzling\" experience of 1954\\nand 1958, when wages kept rising despite the\\nsubstantial rise in unemployment. It also served\\nto dispose of the rather sterile \"cost push\"-\\n\"demand pull\" controversy.\\nIn the following years, a good deal of attention\\nwent into developing theoretical foundations for\\nthe Phillips curve, in particular along the lines of\\nsearch models (for example, Edmund Phelps et\\nal.). This approach served to shed a new light on\\nthe nature of unemployment by tracing it in the\\nfirst place to labor turnover and search time\\nrather than to lack of jobs as such: in a sense\\nunemployment is all frictional-at least in de-\\nveloped countries. At the same time it clarified\\nhow the availability of more jobs tends to reduce\\nunemployment by increasing vacancies and thus\\nreducing search time.\\nAcceptance of the Phillips curve relation\\nimplied some significant changes in the Keynes-\\nian framework which partly escaped notice until\\nthe subsequent monetarists\\' attacks. Since the\\nrate of change of wages decreased smoothly with\\nthe rate of unemployment, there was no longer a\\nunique Full Employment but rather a whole\\nfamily of possible equilibrium rates, each asso-\\nciated with a different rate of inflation (and re-\\nquiring, presumably, a different long-run\\ngrowth of money). It also impaired the notion of\\na stable underemployment equilibrium. A fall in\\ndemand could still cause an initial rise in unem-\\nployment but this rise, by reducing the growth of\\nwages, would eventually raise the real money\\nsupply, tending to return unemployment to the\\nequilibrium rate consistent with the given long-\\nrun growth of money.\\nBut at the practical level it did not lessen the\\ncase for counteracting lasting demand distur-\\nbances through stabilization policies rather than\\nby relying on the slow process of wage adjust-\\nment to do the job, at the cost of protracted un-\\nemployment and instability of prices. Indeed,\\nthe realm of stabilization policies appeared to ex-\\npand in the sense that the stabilization authority\\nhad the power of choosing the unemployment\\nrate around which employment was to be sta-\\nbilized, though it then had to accept the asso-\\nciated inflation. Finally, the dependence of wage\\nchanges also on past inflation forced recognition\\nof a distinction between the short- and the long-\\nrun Phillips curve, the latter exhibiting the long-\\nrun equilibrium rate of inflation implied by a\\nmaintained unemployment rate. The fact that the\\nlong-run tradeoff between unemployment and\\ninflation was necessarily less favorable than the\\nshort-run one, opened up new vistas of \"enjoy-\\nit-now, pay-later\" policies, and even resulted in\\nan entertaining literature on the political busi-\\nness cycle and how to stay in the saddle by riding\\nthe Phillips curve (see for example, Ray Fair,\\nWilliam Nordhaus).\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'II. The Monetarists\\' Attack\\nA. The Stabilizing Power of the\\nHicksian Mechanism\\nThe monetarists\\' attack on Keynesianism was\\ndirected from the very beginning not at the\\nKeynesian framework as such, but at whether it\\nreally implied a need for stabilization. It rested\\non a radically different empirical assessment of\\nthe value of the parameters controlling the sta-\\nbilizing power of the Hicksian mechanism and of\\nthe magnitude and duration of response to\\nshocks, given a stable money supply. And this\\ndifferent assessment in turn was felt to justify a\\nradical downgrading of the practical relevance\\nof the Keynesian framework as distinguished\\nfrom its analytical validity.\\nLiquidity preference was a fine contribution\\nto monetary theory but in practice the respon-\\nsiveness of the demand for money, and hence of\\nvelocity, to interest rates, far from being unman-\\nageably large, was so small that according to a\\nwell-known paper by Milton Friedman (1969),\\nit could not even be detected empirically. On the\\nother hand, the effect of interest rates on aggre-\\ngate demand was large and by no means limited\\nto the traditional fixed investments but quite\\npervasive. The difficulty of detecting it empir-\\nically resulted from focusing on a narrow range\\nof measured market rates and from the fact that\\nwhile the aggregate could be counted on to re-\\nspond, the response of individual components\\nmight not be stable. Finally, Friedman\\'s cele-\\nbrated contribution to the theory of the consump-\\ntion function (1957) (and my own work on the\\nlife cycle hypothesis with Richard Brumberg and\\nothers, reviewed by the author, 1975) implied a\\nvery high short-run marginal propensity to save\\nin response to transient disturbances to income\\nand hence a small short-run multiplier.\\nAll this justified the conclusion that (i) though\\ndemand shocks might qualitatively work along\\nthe lines described by Keynes, quantitatively the\\nHicks mechanism is so strong that their impact\\nwould be small and transient, provided the\\nstock of money was kept on a steady growth\\npath; (ii) fiscal policy actions, like other demand\\nshocks, would have minor and transitory effects\\non demand, while changes in money would\\nproduce large and permanent effects on money\\nincome; and, therefore, (iii) the observed in-\\nstability of the economy, which was anyway\\nproving moderate as the postwar period un-\\nfolded, was most likely the result of the unstable\\ngrowth of money, be it due to misguided en-\\ndeavors to stabilize income or to the pursuit of\\nother targets, which were either irrelevant or, in\\nthe case of balance of payments goals, should\\nhave been made irrelevant by abandoning fixed\\nexchanges.\\nB. The Demise of Wage Rigidity and the\\nVertical Phillips Curve\\nBut the most serious challenge came in\\nFriedman\\'s 1968 Presidential Address, building\\non ideas independently put forth also by Phelps\\n(1968). Its basic message was that, despite ap-\\npearances, wages were in reality perfectly flex-\\nible and there was accordingly no involuntary\\nunemployment. The evidence to the contrary,\\nincluding the Phillips curve, was but a statistical\\nillusion resulting from failure to differentiate be-\\ntween price changes and unexpected price\\nchanges.\\nFriedman starts out by reviving the Keynesian\\nnotion that, at any point of time, there exists a\\nunique full-employment rate which he labels the\\n\"\\'natural rate.\" An unanticipated fall in demand\\nin Friedman\\'s competitive world leads firms to\\nreduce prices and also output and employment\\nalong the short-run marginal cost curve unless\\nthe nominal wage declines together with prices.\\nBut workers, failing to judge correctly the cur-\\nrent and prospective fall in prices, misinterpret\\nthe reduction of nominal wages as a cut in real\\nwages. Hence, assuming a positively sloped\\nsupply function, they reduce the supply of labor.\\nAs a result, the effective real wage rises to the\\npoint where the resulting decline in the demand\\nfor labor matches the reduced supply. Thus, out-\\nput falls not because of the decline in demand,\\nbut because of the entirely voluntary reduction in\\nthe supply of labor, in response to erroneous\\nperceptions. Furthermore, the fall in employ-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The very same mech-\\nanism works in the case of an increase in de-\\nmand, so that the responsiveness of wages and\\nprices is the same on either side of the natural\\nrate.\\nThe upshot is that Friedman's model also\\nimplies a Phillips-type relation between infla-\\ntion, employment or unemployment, and past\\ninflation,-provided the latter variable is inter-\\npreted as a reasonable proxy for expected infla-\\ntion. But it turns the standard explanation on its\\nhead: instead of (excess) employment causing\\ninflation, it is (the unexpected component of)\\nthe rate of inflation that causes excess\\nemployment.\\nOne very basic implication of Friedman's\\nmodel is that the coefficient of price expectations\\nshould be precisely unity. This specification\\nimplies that whatever the shape of the short-run\\nPhillips curve a shape determined by the rela-\\ntion between expected and actual price changes,\\nand by the elasticity of labor supply with respect\\nto the perceived real wage the long-run curve\\nmust be vertical.\\nFriedman's novel twist provided a fresh prop\\nfor the claim that stabilization policies are not\\nreally needed, for, with wages flexible, except\\npossibly for transient distortions, the Hicksian\\nmechanism receives powerful reinforcement\\nfrom changes in the real money supply. Simi-\\nlarly, the fact that full employment was a razor\\nedge provided new support for the claim that\\nstabilization policies were bound to prove de-\\nstabilizing.\\nC. The Macro Rational Expectations Revolution\\nBut the death blow to the already badly bat-\\ntered Keynesian position was to come only\\nshortly thereafter by incorporating into Fried-\\nman's model the so-called rational expectation\\nhypothesis, or REH. Put very roughly, this hy-\\npothesis, originally due to John Muth, states that\\nrational economic agents will endeavor to form\\nexpectations of relevant future variables by\\nmaking the most efficient use of all information\\nprovided by past history. It is a fundamental and\\nfruitful contribution that has already found many\\nimportant applications, for example, in connec-\\ntion with speculative markets, and as a basis for\\nsome thoughtful criticism by Robert Lucas\\n( 1976) of certain features of econometric mod-\\nels. What I am concerned with here is only its\\napplication to macro-economics, or MREH,\\nassociated with such authors as Lucas (1972),\\nThomas Sargent (1976), and Sargent and Neil\\nWallace (1976).\\nThe basic ingredient of MREH is the postulate\\nthat the workers of Friedman's model hold ratio-\\nnal expectations, which turns out to have a num-\\nber of remarkable implications: (i) errors of\\nprice expectations, which are the only source of\\ndeparture from the natural state, cannot be\\navoided but they can only be short-lived and\\nrandom. In particular, there cannot be persistent\\nunemployment above the natural rate for this\\nwould imply high serial correlation between the\\nsuccessive errors of expectation, which is incon-\\nsistent with rational expectations; (ii) any at-\\ntempts to stabilize the economy by means of\\nstated monetary or fiscal rules are bound to be\\ntotally ineffective because their effect will be\\nfully discounted in rational expectations; (iii)\\nnor can the government successfully pursue ad\\nhoc measures to offset shocks. The private sec-\\ntor is already taking care of any anticipated\\nshock; therefore government policy could con-\\nceivably help only if the government informa-\\ntion was better than that of the public, which is\\nimpossible, by the very definition of rational\\nexpectations. Under these conditions, ad hoc\\nstabilization policies are most likely to produce\\ninstead further destabilizing shocks.\\nThese are clearly remarkable conclusions, and\\na major rediscovery for it had all been said 40\\nyears ago by Keynes in a well-known passage of\\nThe General Theory:\\nIf, indeed, labour were always in a posi-\\ntion to take action (and were to do so),\\nwhenever there was less than full employ-\\nment, to reduce its money demands by\\nconcerted action to whatever point was\\nrequired to make money so abundant rela-\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

That conclu-\\nsion, by now, does not meet serious objection\\nfrom nonmonetarists, at least as a first\\napproximation.\\nBut the proposition that other things equal,\\nand given time enough, the economy will even-\\ntually adjust to any indefinitely maintained stock\\nof money, or nth derivative thereof, can be de-\\nrived from a variety of models and, in any event,\\nis of very little practical relevance, as I will argue\\nbelow. What is unacceptable, because incon-\\nsistent with both micro and macro evidence, is\\nthe specific monetarist model set out above and\\nits implication that all unemployment is a volun-\\ntary, fleeting response to transitory mis-\\nperceptions.\\nOne may usefully begin with a criticism of the\\nMacro Rational Expectations model and why\\nKeynes\\' \"if\" should not be replaced by\\n\"since.\" At the logical level, Benjamin Fried-\\nman has called attention to the omission from\\nMREH of an explicit learning model, and has\\nsuggested that, as a result, it can only be inter-\\npreted as a description not of short-run but of\\nlong-run equilibrium in which no agent would\\nwish to recontract. But then the implications of\\nMREH are clearly far from startling, and their\\npolicy relevance is almost nil. At the institu-\\ntional level, Stanley Fischer has shown that the\\nmere recognition of long-term contracts is suf-\\nficient to generate wage rigidity and a substantial\\nscope for stabilization policies. But the most\\nglaring flaw of MREH is its inconsistency with\\nthe evidence: if it were valid, deviations of un-\\nemployment from the natural rate would be\\nsmall and transitory in which case The Gen-\\neral Theory would not have been written and\\nneither would this paper. Sargent (1976) has\\nattempted to remedy this fatal flaw by hypothe-\\nsizing that the persistent and large fluctuations\\nin unemployment reflect merely corresponding\\nswings in the natural rate itself. In other words,\\nwhat happened to the United States in the 1930\\'s\\nwas a severe attack of contagious laziness! I can\\nonly say that, despite Sargent\\'s ingenuity,\\nneither I nor, I expect, most others at least of\\nthe nonmonetarists\\' persuasion are quite ready\\nyet to turn over the field of economic fluctua-\\ntions to the social psychologist!\\nEqually serious objections apply to Fried-\\nman\\'s modeling of the commodity market as a\\nperfectly competitive one-so that the real wage\\nrate is continuously equated to the short-run\\nmarginal product of labor-and to his treatment\\nof labor as a homogenous commodity traded in\\nan auction market, so that, at the going wage,\\nthere never is any excess demand by firms or\\nexcess supply by workers. The inadequacies of\\nthis model as a useful formalization of present\\nday Western economies are so numerous that\\nonly a few of the major ones can be mentioned\\nhere.\\nFriedman\\'s view of unemployment as a vol-\\nuntary reduction in labor supply could at best\\nprovide an explanation of variations in labor\\nforce-and then only under the questionable\\nassumption that the supply function has a sig-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Further-\\nmore, it cannot be reconciled with the well-\\nknown fact that rising unemployment is\\naccompanied by a fall, not by a rise in quits, nor\\nwith the role played by temporary layoffs to\\nwhich Martin Feldstein has recently called\\nattention. Again, his competitive model of\\nthe commodity market, accepted also in The\\nGeneral Theorv, implies that changes in real\\nwages. adjusted for long-run productivity trend,\\nshould be significantly negatively correlated\\nwith cyclical changes in employment and output\\nand with changes in money wages. But as early\\nas 1938, John Dunlop showed that this conclu-\\nsion was rejected by some eighty years of British\\nexperience and his results have received some\\nsupport in more recent tests of Ronald Bodkin\\nfor the United States and Canada. Similar tests\\nof my own, using quarterly data, provide strik-\\ning confirmation that for the last two decades\\nfrom the end of the Korean War until 1973, the\\nassociation of trend adjusted real compensa-\\ntions of the private nonfarm sector with either\\nemployment or the change in nominal compen-\\nsation is prevailingly positive and very signifi-\\ncantly so.\\'\\nThis evidence can, instead, be accounted for\\nby the oligopolistic pricing model-according\\nto which price is determined by long-run mini-\\nmum average cost up to a mark-up reflecting\\nentry-preventing considerations (see the author,\\n1958) coupled with some lags in the adjust-\\nment of prices to costs. This model implies that\\nfirms respond to a change in demand by endeav-\\noring to adjust output and employment, without\\nsignificant changes in prices relative to wages;\\nand the resulting changes in available jobs have\\ntheir initial impact not on wages but rather on\\nunemployment by way of layoffs and recalls and\\nthrough changes in the level of vacancies, and\\nhence on the length of average search time.\\nIf, in the process, vacancies rise above a criti-\\ncal level, or \"natural rate,\" firms will endeavor\\nto reduce them by outbidding each other, thereby\\nraising the rate of change of wages. Thus, as\\nlong as jobs and vacancies remain above, and\\nunemployment remains below, some critical\\nlevel which might be labeled the \"noninflation-\\nary rate\" (see the author and Lucas Papademos,\\n1975), wages and prices will tend to accelerate.\\nIf, on the other hand, jobs fall below, and unem-\\nployment rises above, the noninflationary rate,\\nfirms finding that vacancies are less than optimal\\n-in the limit the unemployed queuing outside\\nthe gate will fill them instantly will have an\\nincentive to reduce their relative wage offer. But\\nin this case, in which too much labor is looking\\nfor too few jobs, the trend toward a sustained\\ndecline in the rate of growth of wages is likely\\nto be even weaker than the corresponding accel-\\neration when too many jobs are bidding for too\\nfew people. The main reason is the nonhomo-\\ngeneity of labor. By far the largest and more\\nvaluable source of labor supply to a firm consists\\nof those already employed who are not readily\\ninterchangeable with the unemployed and, in\\ncontrast with them, are concerned with protec-\\nting their earnings and not with reestablishing\\nfull employment. For these reasons, and because\\nthe first to quit are likely to be the best workers, a\\nreduction of the labor force can, within limits, be\\naccomplished more economically, not by re-\\nducing wages to generate enough quits, but by\\nfiring or, when possible, by layoffs which insure\\naccess to a trained labor force when demand\\nrecovers.

The one experiment\\nwe have had the Great Depression suggests\\nthe answer is negative, and while I admit that,\\nfor a variety of reasons, that evidence is mud-\\ndied, I hope that we will never have the oppor-\\ntunity for a second, clean experiment.\\nIn any event, what is really important for\\npractical purposes is not the long-run equilib-\\nrium relation as such, but the speed with which it\\nis approached. Both the model sketched out and\\nthe empirical evidence suggest that the process\\nof acceleration or deceleration of wages when\\nunemployment differs from the noninflationary\\nrate will have more nearly the character of a\\ncrawl than of a gallop. It will suffice to recall in\\nthis connection that there was excess demand\\npressure in the United States at least from 1965\\nto mid- 1970, and during that period the growth\\nof inflation was from some 1.5 to only about 5.5\\npercent per year. And the response to the excess\\nsupply pressure from mid-1970 to early 1973,\\nand from late 1974 to date was equally sluggish.\\nB. The Power of Self-Stabilizing Mechanisms:\\nThe Evidence from Econometric Models\\nThere remains to consider the monetarists'\\ninitial criticism of Keynesianism, to wit, that\\neven without high wage flexibility, the system's\\nresponse to demand shocks is small and short-\\nlived, thanks to the power of the Hicksian mech-\\nanism. Here it must be acknowledged that every\\none of the monetarists' criticisms of early,\\nsimpleminded Keynesianism has proved in\\nconsiderable measure correct.\\nWith regard to the interest elasticity of de-\\nmand for money, post-Keynesian developments\\nin the theory of money, and in particular, the\\ntheoretical contributions of William Baumol,\\nJames Tobin, Merton Miller, and Daniel Orr,\\npoint to a modest value of around one-half to\\none-third, and empirical studies (see for exam-\\nple, Stephen Goldfeld) are largely consistent\\nwith this prediction (at least until 1975!). Simi-\\nlarly, the dependence of consumption on long-\\nrun, or life cycle, income and on wealth,\\ntogether with the high marginal tax rates of the\\npostwar period, especially the corporate tax,\\nand leakages through imports, lead to a rather\\nlow estimate of the multiplier.\\nLast but not least, both theoretical and empir-\\nical work, reflected in part in econometric mod-\\nels, have largely vindicated the monetarist\\ncontention that interest effects on demand are\\npervasive and substantial. Thus, in the construc-\\ntion and estimation of the MIT-Penn-Social\\nScience Research Council (MPS) econometric\\nmodel of the United States, we found evidence\\nof effects, at least modest, on nearly every com-\\nponent of aggregate demand. One response to\\nmoney supply changes that is especially impor-\\ntant in the MPS, if somewhat controversial, is\\nvia interest rates on the market value of all assets\\nand thus on consumption.\\nThere is, therefore, substantial agreement that\\nin the United States the Hicksian mechanism is\\nfairly effective in limiting the effect of shocks,\\nand that the response of wages and prices to\\nexcess demand or supply will also work gradu-\\nally toward eliminating largely, if not totally,\\nany effect on employment. But in the view of\\nnonmonetarists, the evidence overwhelmingly\\nsupports the conclusion that the interim response\\nis still of significant magnitude and of consider-\\nable duration, basically because the wheels of\\nthe offsetting mechanism grind slowly.

Furthermore, while this response is building\\nup, multiplier and accelerator mechanisms work\\ntoward amplifying the shock. Finally, the clas-\\nsical mechanism the change in real money\\nsupply through prices has an even longer lag\\nbecause of the sluggish response of wages to\\nexcess demand.\\nThese interferences are supported by simula-\\ntions with econometric models like the MPS.\\nIsolating, first, the working of the Hicksian\\nmechanism by holding prices constant, we find\\nthat a 1 percent demand shock, say a rise in real\\nexports, produces an impact effect on aggregate\\noutput which is barely more than 1 percent, rises\\nto a peak of only about 2 percent a year later, and\\nthen declines slowly toward a level somewhat\\nover 1.5 percent.\\nTaking into account the wage price mech-\\nanism hardly changes the picture for the first\\nyear because of its inertia. Thereafter, however,\\nit becomes increasingly effective so that a year\\nlater the real response is back at the impact level,\\nand by the end of the third year the shock has\\nbeen fully offset (thereafter output oscillates\\naround zero in a damped fashion). Money in-\\ncome, on the other hand, reaches a peak of over\\n2.5, and then only by the middle of the second\\nyear. It declines thereafter, and tends eventually\\nto oscillate around a positive value because nor-\\nmally, a demand shock requires eventually a\\nchange in interest rates and hence in velocity\\nand money income.\\nThese results, which are broadly confirmed by\\nother econometric models, certainly do not sup-\\nport the view of a highly unstable economy in\\nwhich fiscal policy has powerful and everlasting\\neffects. But neither do they support the mone-\\ntarist view of a highly stable economy in which\\nshocks hardly make a ripple and the effects of\\nfiscal policy are puny and fast vanishing.\\nC. The Monetarist Evidence and the\\nSt. Louis Quandary\\nMonetarists, however, have generally been\\ninclined to question this evidence. They coun-\\ntered at first with tests bearing on the stability of\\nvelocity and the insignificance of the multiplier,\\nwhich, however, as indicated in my criticism\\nwith Albert Ando (1965), must be regarded as\\nclose to worthless. More recently, several au-\\nthors at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\\n(Leonall Andersen, Keith Carlson, Jerry Lee\\nJordan) have suggested that instead of deriving\\nmultipliers from the analytical or numerical\\nsolution of an econometric model involving a\\nlarge number of equations, any one of which\\nmay be questioned, they should be estimated\\ndirectly through \"reduced form\" equations by\\nrelating the change in income to current and\\nlagged changes in some appropriate measure of\\nthe money supply and of fiscal impulses.\\nThe results of the original test, using the\\ncurrent and but four lagged values of M1 and of\\nhigh Employment Federal Expenditure as mea-\\nsures of monetary and fiscal impulses, turned out\\nto be such as to fill a monetarist\\'s heart with joy.\\nThe contribution of money, not only current but\\nalso lagged, was large and the coefficients im-\\nplied a not unreasonable effect of the order of\\nmagnitude of the velocity of circulation, though\\nsomewhat higher. On the other hand, the esti-\\nmated coefficients of the fiscal variables seemed\\nto support fully the monetarists\\' claim that their\\nimpact was both small and fleeting: the effect\\npeaked in but two quarters and was only around\\none, and disappeared totally by the fourth quar-\\nter following the change.\\nThese results were immediately attacked on\\nthe ground that the authors had used the wrong\\nmeasure of monetary and fiscal actions, and it\\nwas shown that the outcome was somewhat\\nsensitive to alternative measures; however, the\\nbasic nature of the results did not change, at least\\nqualitatively. In particular, the outcome does not\\ndiffer materially, at least for the original period\\nup to 1969, if one replaces high employment out-\\nlays with a variable that might be deemed more\\nsuitable, like government expenditure on goods\\nand services, plus exports.\\nThese results must be acknowledged as dis-\\nturbing for nonmonetarists, for there is little\\nquestion that movements in government pur-\\nchases and exports are a major source of demand\\ndisturbances; if econometric model estimates of\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

He\\nshows in the first place that different methods\\nof estimation yield widely different estimates,\\nincluding many which clearly overstate the\\nexpenditure and understate the money multi-\\npliers. He further points out that, given the\\nunreliability of the estimates resulting from\\nmulticollinearity and large residual variance,\\nthe relevant question to ask is not whether\\nthese estimates differ from those obtained by\\nstructural estimation, but whether the difference\\nis statistically significant; that is, larger than\\ncould be reasonably accounted for by sampling\\nfluctuations.\\nI have carried out this standard statistical test\\nusing as true response coefficients those gener-\\nated by the MPS model quoted earlier.2 I find\\nthat, at least when the test is based on the largest\\npossible sample-the entire post-Korean period\\nup to the last two very disturbed years-the\\ndifference is totally insignificant when estima-\\ntion is in level form (F is less than one) and is\\nstill not significant at the 5 percent level, when in\\nfirst differences.\\nThis test resolves the puzzle by showing that\\nthere really is no puzzle: the two alternative esti-\\nmates of the expenditure multipliers are not\\ninconsistent, given the margin of error of the\\nestimates.

The results are clear cut: the errors using\\nthe reduced form coefficient are not smaller but\\non the average substantially larger than those\\nusing MPS multipliers. For the first four years,\\nterminating at the end of 1973, the St. Louis\\nequation produces errors which are distinctly\\nlarger in eight quarters, and smaller in but three,\\nand its squared error is one-third larger. For the\\nlast two years of turmoil, both equations perform\\nmiserably, though even here the MPS coeffi-\\ncients perform just a bit better.

The clearest evidence\\non the importance of such shocks is provided by\\nour postwar record with its six recessions.\\nIV. The Record of Stabilization Policies:\\nStabilizing or Destabilizing\\nA. Was Postwar Instability Due to Unstable\\nMoney Growth?\\nAt this point, of course, monetarists will ob-\\nject that, over the postwar period, we have not\\nhad a constant money growth policy and will hint\\nthat the observed instability can largely be traced\\nto the instability of money. The only way of\\nmeeting this objection squarely would be, of\\ncourse, to rerun history with a good computer\\ncapable of calculating 3 percent at the helm of\\nthe Fed.\\nA more feasible, if less conclusive approach\\nmight be to look for some extended periods in\\nwhich the money supply grew fairly smoothly\\nand see how the economy fared. Combing\\nthrough our post-Korean War history, I have\\nbeen able to find just two stretches of several\\nyears in which the growth of the money stock\\nwas relatively stable, whether one chooses to\\nmeasure stability in terms of percentage devia-\\ntions from a constant growth or of dispersion of\\nfour-quarter changes. It may surprise some that\\none such stretch occurred quite recently and\\nconsists of the period of nearly four years begin-\\nning in the first quarter of 1971 (see the author\\nand Papademos, 1976). During this period, the\\naverage growth was quite large, some 7 percent,\\nbut it was relatively smooth, generally well\\nwithin the 6 to 8 percent band. The average\\ndeviation from the mean is about .75 percent.\\nThe other such period lasted from the beginning\\nof 1953 to the first half of 1957, again a stretch\\nof roughly four years. In sharp contrast to the\\nmost recent period, the average growth here is\\nquite modest, only about 2 percent; but again,\\nmost four-quarter changes fell well within a\\nband of two percentage points, and the average\\ndeviation is again .7. By contrast, during the\\nremaining 13-year stretch from mid-1957 to the\\nend of 1970, the variability of money growth\\nwas roughly twice as large if measured by the\\naverage deviation of four quarter changes, and\\nsome five times larger if measured by the per-\\ncentage deviation of the money stock from a\\nconstant growth trend.\\nHow did the economy fare in the two periods\\nof relatively stable money growth? It is common\\nknowledge that the period from 1971 to 1974, or\\nfrom 1972 to 1975 if we want to allow a one-year\\nlag for money to do its trick, was distinctly the\\nmost unstable in our recent history, marked by\\nsharp fluctuations in output and wild gyrations\\nof the rate of change of prices. As a result, the\\naverage deviation of the four-quarter changes in\\noutput was 3.3 percent, more than twice as large\\nas in the period of less stable money growth. But\\nthe first stretch was also marked by well above\\naverage instability, with the contraction of 1954,\\nthe sharp recovery of 1955, and the new contrac-\\ntion in 1958, the sharpest in postwar history\\nexcept for the present one.

If\\none eliminates all major sources of shocks, for\\nexample, by smoothing federal government\\nexpenditures, we found, as did Otto Eckstein in\\nan earlier experiment, that a stable money\\ngrowth of 3 percent per year does stabilize the\\neconomy, as expected. But when we allowed for\\nall the historical shocks, the result was that with\\na constant money growth the economy was far\\nfrom stable-in fact, it was distinctly less stable\\nthan actual experience, by a factor of 50 percent.\\nB. The Overall Effectiveness of Postwar\\nStabilization Policies\\nBut even granted that a smooth money supply\\nwill not produce a very stable world and that\\nthere is therefore room for stabilization policies,\\nmonetarists will still argue that we should none-\\ntheless eschew such policies. They claim, first,\\nthat allowing for unpredictably variable lags and\\nunforseeable future shocks, we do not know\\nenough to successfully design stabilization\\npolicies, and second, that the government would\\nsurely be incapable of choosing the appropriate\\npolicies or be politically willing to provide\\ntimely enforcement. Thus, in practice, stabili-\\nzation policies will result in destabilizing the\\neconomy much of the time.\\nThis view is supported by two arguments, one\\nlogical and one empirical. The logical argument\\nis the one developed in Friedman's Presidential\\nAddress (1968). An attempt at stabilizing the\\neconomy at full employment is bound to be de-\\nstabilizing because the full employment or\\nnatural rate is not known with certainty and is\\nsubject to shifts in time; and if we aim for the\\nincorrect rate, the result must perforce be explo-\\nsive inflation or deflation. By contrast, with a\\nconstant money supply policy, the economy will\\nautomatically hunt for, and eventually discover,\\nthat shifty natural rate, wherever it may be\\nhiding.\\nThis argument, I submit, is nothing but a\\ndebating ploy. It rests on the preposterous as-\\nsumption that the only alternative to a constant\\nmoney growth is the pursuit of a very precise\\nunemployment target which will be adhered to\\nindefinitely no matter what, and that if the target\\nis off in the second decimal place, galloping\\ninflation is around the corner. In reality, all that\\nis necessary to pursue stabilization policies is a\\nrough target range that includes the warranted\\nrate, itself a range and not a razor edge; and, of\\ncourse, responsible supporters of stabilization\\npolicies have long been aware of the fact that the\\ntarget range needs to be adjusted in time on the\\nbasis of forseeable shifts in the warranted range,\\nas well as in the light of emerging evidence that\\nthe current target is not consistent with price\\nstability. It is precisely for this reason that I, as\\nwell as many other nonmonetarists, would side\\nwith monetarists in strenuous opposition to\\nrecent proposals for a target unemployment rate\\nrigidly fixed by statute (although there is nothing\\nwrong with Congress committing itself and the\\ncountry to work toward the eventual achieve-\\nment of some target unemployment rate through\\nstructural changes rather than aggregate demand\\npolicies).\\nClearly, even the continuous updating of\\ntargets cannot guarantee that errors can be\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

Furthermore, the greater\\nstability in the United States, and in other indus-\\ntrialized countries, are obviously not indepen-\\ndent events. Still, at least as of the time of that\\nconference, there seemed to be little question\\nand some evidence that part of the credit for the\\ngreater stability should go to the conscious and\\non balance, successful endeavor at stabilizing\\nthe economy.\\nV. The Case of Supply Shocks and the\\n1974-76 Episode\\nA. Was the 1974 Depression Due to Errors of\\nCommission or Omission?\\nIn pointing out our relative postwar stability\\nand the qualified success of stabilization poli-\\ncies, I have carefully defined the postwar period\\nas ending somewhere in 1973. What has hap-\\npened since that has so tarnished the reputation\\nof economists? In facing this problem, the first\\nquestion that needs to be raised is whether the\\nrecent combination of unprecedented rates of\\ninflation as well as unemployment must be\\ntraced to crimes of commission or omission. Did\\nour monetary and fiscal stabilization policies\\nmisfire, or did we instead fail to use them?\\nWe may begin by establishing one point that\\nhas been blurred by monetarists\\' blanket indict-\\nments of recent monetary policy: the virulent\\nexplosion that raised the four-quarter rate of\\ninflation from about 4 percent in 1972 to 6.5\\npercent by the third quarter of 1973, to 11.5\\npercent in 1974 with a peak quarterly rate of\\n13.5, can in no way be traced to an excessive, or\\nto a disorderly, growth of the money supply. As\\nalready mentioned, the average rate of money\\ngrowth from the beginning of 1970 to the second\\nhalf of 1974 was close to 7 percent. To be sure,\\nthis was a high rate and could be expected sooner\\nor later to generate an undesirably high inflation\\n-but how high? Under any reasonable assump-\\ntion one cannot arrive at a figure much above 6\\npercent. This might explain what happened up to\\nthe fall of 1973, but not from the third quarter\\nof 1973 to the end of 1974, which is the really\\ntroublesome period. Similarly, as was indicated\\nabove, the growth of money was reasonably\\nsmooth over this period, smoother than at any\\nother time in the postwar period, staying within\\na 2 percent band. Hence, the debacle of 1974\\ncan just not be traced to an erratic behavior of\\nmoney resulting from a misguided attempt at\\nstabilization.\\nShould one then conclude that the catastrophe\\nresulted from too slavish an adherence to a stable\\ngrowth rate, forsaking the opportunity to use\\nmonetary policy to stabilize the economy? In\\none sense, the answer to this question must in\\nmy view be in the affirmative. There is ample\\nground for holding that the rapid contraction that\\nset in toward the end of 1974, on the heels of a\\nslow decline in the previous three quarters, and\\nwhich drove unemployment to its 9 percent\\npeak, was largely the result of the astronomic\\nrise in interest rates around the middle of the\\nyear. That rise in turn was the unavoidable result\\nof the Fed\\'s stubborn refusal to accommodate,\\nto an adequate extent, the exogenous inflation-\\nary shock due to oil, by letting the money supply\\ngrowth exceed the 6 percent rate announced at\\nthe beginning of the year. And this despite re-\\npeated warnings about that unavoidable result\\n(see, for example, the author 1974).\\nMonetarists have suggested that the sharp\\nrecession was not the result of too slow a mone-\\ntary growth throughout the year, but instead of\\nthe deceleration that took place in the last half of\\n1974, and early 1975. But this explanation just\\ndoes not stand up to the facts. The fall in the\\nquarterly growth of money in the third and fourth\\nquarters was puny, especially on the basis of\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

To be sure, in the first quarter of 1975 the\\ngrowth fell to .6 percent. But, by then, the vio-\\nlent contraction was well on its way-between\\nSeptember 1974 and February 1975, industrial\\nproduction fell at an annual rate of 25 percent.\\nFurthermore, by the next quarter, monetary\\ngrowth had resumed heftily.

But even then, by anybody's\\nmodel, a one-quarter dip in the growth of money\\ncould not have had a perceptible effect.\\nB. What Macro Stabilization Policies\\nCan Accomplish, and How\\nBut recognizing that the adherence to a stable\\nmoney growth path through much of 1974 bears\\na major responsibility for the sharp contraction\\ndoes not per se establish that the policy was\\nmistaken. The reason is that the shock that hit\\nthe system in 1973-74 was not the usual type of\\ndemand shock which we have gradually learned\\nto cope with, more or less adequately. It was,\\ninstead, a supply or price shock, coming from\\na cumulation of causes, largely external. This\\nposes an altogether different stabilization prob-\\nlem. In particular, in the case of demand shocks,\\nthere exists in principle an ideal policy which\\navoids all social costs, namely to offset com-\\npletely the shock thus, at the same time, stabi-\\nlizing employment and the price level. There\\nmay be disagreement as to whether this target\\ncan be achieved and how, but not about the\\ntarget itself.\\nBut in the case of supply shocks, there is no\\nmiracle cure-there is no macro policy which\\ncan both maintain a stable price level and keep\\nemployment at its natural rate. To maintain\\nstable prices in the face of the exogenous price\\nshock, say a rise in import prices, would require\\na fall in all domestic output prices; but we know\\nof no macro policy by which domestic prices can\\nbe made to fall except by creating enough slack,\\nthus putting downward pressure on wages. And\\nthe amount of slack would have to be substantial\\nin view of the sluggishness of wages in the face\\nof unemployment. If we do not offset the exoge-\\nnous shock completely, then the initial burst,\\neven if activated by an entirely transient rise in\\nsome prices, such as a once and for all deteriora-\\ntion in the terms of trade, will give rise to further\\nincreases, as nominal wages rise in a vain at-\\ntempt at preserving real wages; this secondary\\nreaction too can only be cut short by creating\\nslack. In short, once a price shock hits, there is\\nno way of returning to the initial equilibrium\\nexcept after a painful period of both above equi-\\nlibrium unemployment and inflation.\\nThere are, of course, in principle, policies\\nother than aggregate demand management to\\nwhich we might turn, and which are enticing\\nin view of the unpleasant alternatives offered by\\ndemand management. But so far such policies,\\nat least those of the wage-price control variety,\\nhave proved disappointing. The design of better\\nalternatives is probably the greatest challenge\\npresently confronting those interested in stabili-\\nzation. However, these policies fall outside my\\npresent concern. Within the realm of aggregate\\ndemand management, the only choice open to\\nsociety is the cruel one between alternative fea-\\nsible paths of inflation and associated paths of\\nunemployment, and the best the macroecono-\\nmist can offer is policies designed to approxi-\\nmate the chosen path.\\nIn light of the above, we may ask: is it con-\\nceivable that a constant rate of growth of the\\nmoney supply will provide a satisfactory re-\\nsponse to price shocks in the sense of giving\\nrise to an unemployment-inflation path to which\\nthe country would object least?\\nC. The Monetarist Prescription: Or, Constant\\nMoney Growth Once More\\nThe monetarists are inclined to answer this\\nquestion affirmatively, if not in terms of the\\ncountry's preferences, at least in terms of the\\npreferences they think it should have. This is\\nevidenced by their staunch support of a continu-\\nation of the 6 percent or so rate of growth through\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

       " \"1974, 1975, and 1976.\\nTheir reasoning seems to go along the follow-\\ning lines. The natural rate hypothesis implies\\nthat the rate of inflation can change only when\\nemployment deviates from the natural rate. Now\\nsuppose we start from the natural rate and some\\ncorresponding steady rate of inflation, which\\nwithout loss of generality can be assumed as\\nzero. Let there be an exogenous shock which\\ninitially lifts the rate of inflation, say, to 10 per-\\ncent. If the Central Bank, by accommodating\\nthis price rise, keeps employment at the natural\\nrate, the new rate of 10 percent will also be main-\\ntained and will in fact continue forever, as long\\nas the money supply accommodates it. The only\\nway to eliminate inflation is to increase unem-\\nployment enough, above the natural rate and for\\na long enough time, so that the cumulated re-\\nduction of inflation takes us back to zero. There\\nwill of course be many possible unemployment\\npaths that will accomplish this. So the next\\nquestion is: Which is the least undesirable?\\nThe monetarist answer seems to be-and\\nhere I confess that attribution becomes difficult\\n-that it does not make much difference be-\\ncause, to a first approximation, the cumulated\\namount of unemployment needed to unwind\\ninflation is independent of the path. If we take\\nmore unemployment early, we need to take less\\nlater, and conversely. But then it follows imme-\\ndiately that the specific path of unemployment\\nthat would be generated by a constant money\\ngrowth is, if not better, at least as good as any\\nother. Corollary: a constant growth of money is\\na satisfactory answer to supply shocks just as it\\nis to demand shocks-as well as, one may sus-\\npect, to any other conceivable illness, indisposi-\\ntion, or disorder.\\nD. Why Constant Money Growth Cannot\\nBe the Answer\\nThis reasoning is admirably simple and ele-\\ngant, but it suffers from several flaws. The first\\none is a confusion between the price level and\\nits rate of change. With an unchanged constant\\ngrowth of the nominal money stock, the system\\nwill settle back into equilibrium not when the\\nrate of inflation is back to zero but only when,\\nin addition, the price level itself is back to its\\ninitial level. This means that when inflation has\\nfinally returned back to the desired original rate,\\nunemployment cannot also be back to the origi-\\nnal level but will instead remain above it as long\\nas is necessary to generate enough deflation to\\noffset the earlier cumulated inflation. I doubt that\\nthis solution would find many supporters and for\\na good reason; it amounts to requiring that none\\nof the burden of the price shock should fall on\\nthe holder of long-term money fixed contracts-\\nsuch as debts-and that all other sectors of soci-\\nety should shoulder entirely whatever cost is\\nnecessary to insure this result. But if, as seems\\nto be fairly universally agreed, the social target\\nis instead to return the system to the original rate\\nof inflation-zero in our example-then the\\ngrowth of the money supply cannot be kept con-\\nstant. Between the time the shock hits and the\\ntime inflation has returned to the long-run level,\\nthere must be an additional increase in money\\nsupply by as much as the price level or by the\\ncumulant of inflation over the path.\\nA second problem with the monetarists' argu-\\nment is that it implies a rather special preference\\nfunction that depends only on cumulated unem-\\nployment. And, last but not least, it requires the\\nheroic assumption that the Phillips curve be not\\nonly vertical in the long run but also linear in the\\nshort run, an assumption that does not seem\\nconsistent with empirically estimated curves.\\nDropping this last assumption has the effect that,\\nfor any given social preference, there will be in\\ngeneral a unique optimal path. Clearly, for this\\npath to be precisely that generated by a constant\\nmoney growth, would require a miracle-or\\nsome sleight of the invisible hand!\\nActually, there are grounds for holding that\\nthe unemployment path generated by a constant\\nmoney growth, even if temporarily raised to take\\ncare of the first flaw, could not possibly be close\\nto an optimal. This conclusion is based on an\\nanalysis of optimal paths, relying on the type of\\nlinear welfare function that appears to underlie\\nthe monetarists' argument, and which is also a\\nstraightforward generalization of Okun's fa-\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

The index used in my\\nanalysis is a weighted average of the cumulated\\nunemployment and cumulated inflation over the\\npath. The weights express the relative social\\nconcern for inflation versus unemployment.\\nUsing this index, it has been shown in a forth-\\ncoming thesis of Papademos that, in general, the\\noptimum policy calls for raising unemployment\\nat once to a certain critical level and keeping it\\nthere until inflation has substantially abated. The\\ncritical level depends on the nature of the Phillips\\ncurve and the relative weights, but does not\\ndepend significantly on the initial shock-as\\nlong as it is appreciable. To provide an idea of\\nthe order of magnitudes involved, if one relies on\\nthe estimate of the Phillips curve reported in\\nmy joint paper with Papademos (1975), which\\nis fairly close to vertical and uses Okun\\'s\\nweights, one finds that (i) at the present time, the\\nnoninflationary rate of unemployment corres-\\nponding to a 2 percent rate of inflation can be\\nestimated at 5.6 percent, and (ii) the optimal re-\\nsponse to a large exogenous price shock consists\\nin increasing unemployment from 5.6 to only\\nabout 7 percent.

It would tend\\nto be prevailingly too small for some initial\\nperiod and too large thereafter.\\nOne must thus conclude that the case for a\\nconstant money growth is no more tenable in the\\ncase of supply shocks than it is in the case of\\ndemand shocks.\\nVI. Conclusion\\nTo summarize, the monetarists have made a\\nvalid and most valuable contribution in estab-\\nlishing that our economy is far less unstable than\\nthe early Keynesians pictured it and in rehabil-\\nitating the role of money as a determinant of\\naggregate demand. They are wrong, however,\\nin going as far as asserting that the economy is\\nsufficiently shockproof that stabilization poli-\\ncies are not needed. They have also made an\\nimportant contribution in pointing out that such\\npolicies might in fact prove destabilizing. This\\ncriticism has had a salutary effect on reassessing\\nwhat stabilization policies can and should do,\\nand on trimming down fine-tuning ambitions.\\nBut their contention that postwar fluctuations\\nresulted from an unstable money growth or that\\nstabilization policies decreased rather than in-\\ncreased stability just does not stand up to an\\nimpartial examination of the postwar record of\\nthe United States and other industrialized coun-\\ntries. Up to 1974, these policies have helped to\\nkeep the economy reasonable stable by historical\\nstandards, even though one can certainly point\\nto some occasional failures.\\nThe serious deterioration in economic stabil-\\nity since 1973 must be attributed in the first place\\nto the novel nature of the shocks that hit us,\\nnamely, supply shocks.

The Meaning of Supply and Demand\\nin a Macroeconomic Context\\nIt is worth considering whether a new\\nbasic model should guide our thinking\\nabout performance of the economy as a\\nwhole. It is not that the macro models of\\nthe past twenty-five years or so have failed\\nto serve us well. When we consider the state\\nof our knowledge about the analytics of the\\neconomy at the end of World War II and\\nthe apprehensiveness with which we ap-\\nproached the modern era of expansion, it\\nshould be evident that we have come a long\\nway professionally. Yet the economic prob-\\nlems of today seem to be intractable when\\nstudied through the medium of simplified\\nmacro models. The new system should\\ncombine the Keynesian model of final de-\\nmand and income determination with the\\nLeontief model of interindustrial flows.\\nThis is the motivation for my focusing at-\\ntention on the supply side of the economy.\\nIt is frequently said, in almost an offhand\\nmanner, that the theories of aggregate em-\\nployment and output determination are de-\\nmand models, that economic policy for\\noverall direction of the economy is a policy\\nof demand management. I would generally\\nagree with these remarks, but not in every\\nlast detail, once the meaning of demand in\\nthese contexts is carefully pulled apart and\\nanalyzed. The demand aspects are possibly\\noverstated.\\nIt is, of course, true that demand for the\\nGNP built up as the sum of demands by\\nconsumers, businesses, government, and\\nforeigners (consumption, investment, public\\nspending, and net exports) covers total de-\\nmand in the economy and is composed of\\ndemands by the constituent parts. But de-\\nmand by firms, and, in many cases by gov-\\nernment, are not ends in themselves. Busi-\\nness demand is largely for goods to produce\\ngoods. The capital formation that results\\nfrom business demand goes into the incre-\\nment of capital stock, after allowance for\\ncapital consumption, and the capital stock\\nbecomes a factor input in the production\\nfunction. The accumulation of capital con-\\ntributes to the supply of goods and services.\\nIndeed, investment demand now for new\\ncapital facilitates the implementation of the\\nproduction process with the supply of fac-\\ntors of ever-increasing powers of productiv-\\nity, thus making it possible to supply in-\\ncreasing amounts of goods and services\\nwith inputs that are increasing at a some-\\nwhat slower rate.\\nBy focusing attention excessively on the\\n\"short run,\" in which the capital stock is\\ntimelessly held fixed by assumption only\\nand not in reality, we have ignored the sup-\\nply-side characteristics of investment de-\\nmand. Students of today\\'s business cycle\\ncommonly cite investment demand as the\\npromising potential route to higher produc-\\ntivity in the relatively near future, thereby\\nlessening inflationary pressure. In this re-\\nspect, economic theoreticians have been\\nmyopic relative to the applied economic\\nanalysts in the world of affairs. Neverthe-\\nless, as we shall see, there is much more\\nto the supply side than the transformation\\nof investment into productive capital, and\\nthe basic characterization of contemporary\\nmacroeconomics as demand analysis has a\\npoint. A strong indication of the demand\\nside orientation is given by the elaboration\\nof the standard macro model. In place of\\naggregate consumption, the more elaborate\\nmodel gives separate treatment to consumer\\nexpenditures on durables, nondurables, and\\nservices. This is the first stage. At a higher\\nstage, there is further disaggregation into\\ntypes of durables, nondurables, and services\\nsuch as food, cars, medical services, etc.\\nThe detail that is introduced for consump-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Elaboration\\nessentially means taking a closer look at de-\\nmand side components by types of demand.\\nThe mainstream model of macro eco-\\nnomic thought has thus become a detailed\\nsystem of demand analysis, but if it is to be\\na closed system, it will also have to include\\ncorresponding detail on the national income\\nside of the social accounts. If this is done\\nfully, there will have to be analyses of factor\\nrewards, factor use, and pricing. The devel-\\nopment of factor demand goes beyond capi-\\ntal formation, which appears as a demand\\nfor final goods in the GNP, and takes up\\nan explanation of wage income. An ade-\\nquate explanation of wage income cannot\\navoid the explicit treatment of physical\\nproduction involving labor input as well as\\ncapital input. The demand for labor, like\\nthe demand for capital, is supply side analy-\\nsis. While the demand for capital enters di-\\nrectly as a component of total demand, the\\ndemand for labor, together with wage for-\\nmation, enters national income, and only\\nafter expenditure does it enter final demand\\nfor GNP. To the extent that labor produc-\\ntivity affects wage determination and also\\nprice formation, we find supply-side factors\\ninfluencing inflation and consequently the\\noverall performance of the economy. Labor\\ndemand can also be associated with train-\\ning. The training component is, in fact,\\ninvestment in human rather than fixed\\ncapital. Looked at in this way, factor de-\\nmand for labor and factor demand for fixed\\ncapital are simply different, but related,\\naspects of total investment.\\nBehind the IS-LM diagram or other sim-\\nplified renditions of the aggregate demand\\nmodel lie many supply-side relationships.\\nNot only is the supply side in the back-\\nground, but it also plays a more essential\\nrole once it is recognized that the simplified\\nmodel is actually incomplete. If we were to\\nassume the existence of money illusion, it\\nwould be possible to consider the IS-LM\\nsystem as a closed system of relationships\\ndepending on nominal income and nominal\\ninterest rates. I find this approach theoreti-\\ncally unsatisfactory. That simple system\\nexists only as an aggregative approxima-\\ntion for a given price level. If we assume no\\nmoney illusion and, more properly, I be-\\nlieve, the need to determine the aggregate\\nprice level, then the IS-LM diagram does\\nnot provide a closed system analysis, and\\nwe must extend the system to include the\\nwhole supply-side apparatus of production\\nrelationships, factor demand, and factor\\nsupply.\\nIt is well known that Keynes included\\nthe aggregate supply function in the Gen-\\neral Theory, but it was introduced in his\\nchapter on \"The Principle of Effective De-\\nmand.\" That part of his analysis dealing\\nwith supply has been largely played down\\nby the profession at large-not by all stu-\\ndents of macroeconomics.\\' Also, by way of\\nside comment, Keynes probably confused\\nthe issues by making labor supply depen-\\ndent on the nominal wage rate, assuming\\nthe existence of money illusion, and by not\\ntreating the stock of capital as an explicit\\nvariable.\\nIf the demand relationships explaining\\nthe components of the GNP are disaggre-\\ngated into a highly detailed set, it does not\\nnecessarily mean that the supply side must\\nbe equally disaggregated to a similar extent,\\nas long as the total flow of income and\\npurchasing power to be directed towards\\nthe expenditure flow can be generated. The\\ndetailed expenditure flow will, however, in-\\nvolve price relatives. That is a consequence\\nof disaggregation. An aggregate supply-side\\nexplanation that generates only an average\\nprice level for output as a whole can be\\nadequate, provided separate prices, needed\\nfor the price-relatives, can be explained in\\nterms of a relationship to the overall price\\nor wage level. This is much like the use of a\\nterm structure relationship in credit market\\nanalysis to explain the spectrum of interest\\nrates, given one strategic rate.\\nIt is, however, more satisfactory, and\\nmore revealing, to explain the whole set of\\nprices, one by one, on the basis of costs\\nin individual sectors.

A prin-\\ncipal feature of such combined systems is\\nthat they are not based on restrictive as-\\nsumptions of the fixed coefficient input-\\noutput model, but are generalized to allow\\nthe coefVlcients of production to vary, ac-\\ncording to the variation of relative prices.\\nThe above expression, \"full feedback,\"\\nmeans that the macro model of final de-\\nmand and national income generation can-\\nnot be solved, by itself, without also solving\\nthe input-output system for generatin- sec-\\ntor production flows. Moreover sector\\nprices cannot be solved without also solving\\nthe macro model simultaneously.\\nPrice formation in individual sectors is\\nspecified in terms of mark-up relations over\\nunit labor costs. Thus, sector outputs and\\nlabor inputs are needed in order to explain\\nsector prices. These prices are needed, in\\nturn, in order to explain final demand\\nprices. Similarly, sector investment depends\\non sector output as well as sector price.\\nIt is for these and similar reasons that final\\ndemand cannot be generated without mak-\\ning use of the input-output system in order\\nto generate sector outputs.\\nAt the same time, the input-output sys-\\ntem is driven by final demand; therefore,\\nthe conventional macro demand model\\nmust be used in order to solve the input-\\noutput system. These are the specific senses\\nin which full feedback is used in order to\\nobtain simultaneous and consistent integra-\\ntion of the entire supply and demand sides\\nof the economy.\\nIn terms of the history of economic\\nthought, the above approach means think-\\ning in terms of the empirical implementa-\\ntion of the Walrasian system. Essentially,\\nTinbergen implemented the Keynesian sys-\\ntem and Leontief implemented a part of the\\nWalrasian system. By putting the two to-\\ngether, with due allowance to Kuznets for\\nmaking the data bases of final demand and\\nnational income available, a complete syn-\\nthesis of supply and demand in the econ-\\nomy as a whole can be put together. This\\ngives the antecedents of what is meant by\\nmodeling supply, taking into account what\\nis needed from demand models at the same\\ntime.\\nIII. Why Model Supply?\\nAt the time of the Keynesian Revolution,\\nthere was a pervasive deficiency of demand\\nthroughout most of the world. The Key-\\nnesian policy development, building on\\nthat model, did, in my opinion, much good\\nfor the economy of the Western world, en-\\nabling us to come through an expansive era\\nof more than twenty-five years without a re-\\ncurrence of a Great Depression. That does\\nnot mean that this system of thought and\\npolicy formation did its work for all time\\nin putting the world economy on a stable\\nfooting. It carried the situation only so far,\\nand undoubtedly underestimated inflation\\npotentials, leaving us now at the point\\nwhere new systems of thought, drawing\\nmore on the supply side, are needed in\\norder to develop policies that will be able\\nto deal with the world\\'s contemporary eco-\\nnomic problems; hopefully, policies that\\nwill have as much longevity as the demand\\nmanagement policies of the last two to three\\ndecades. That should bring us nicely into\\nthe twenty-first century, which is about as\\nfar ahead as we might attempt to look at the\\npresent time.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"The limits of demand management pol-\\nicies have become clearly visible in recent\\nyears. Let us look at the issues through the\\nmedium of specific problems, say the joint\\nproblems of too much unemployment and\\ntoo much inflation. Policies of demand\\nmanagement alone have appeared to be\\nadequate to deal with one or the other, but\\nnot both together. If demand is stimulated\\nenough to bring down the unemployment\\nrate to a full-employment minimum, there\\nis danger of generating undue inflationary\\npressure as a side effect. Conversely, anti-\\ninflationary policies of demand restriction\\nrun the danger of generating excessive un-\\nemployment while holding down the infla-\\ntion rate.\\nHow might supply-side policies be intro-\\nduced to lower both the inflation and un-\\nemployment rates at the same time'? It is\\nconventionally thought that policies of ag-\\ngregative demand stimulus through tradi-\\ntional fiscal and monetary policies might be\\nable to bring down the U.S. unemployment\\nrate to about 5.5 percent. This is not a firm\\npoint estimate, and is subject to error of at\\nleast one-half point above or below that\\nfigure, but it is not, in any case, a full-em-\\nployment target figure.\\nOne way, but not the only way, of getting\\nto full employnment without generating fresh\\ninflationary pressure is to design a jobs pro-\\ngram for about 1.0 million long-term, hard\\ncore unemployed. This jobs program can-\\nnot be described in full detail in the context\\nof this presentation, but it is not to be\\nviewed as an ordinary public jobs program.\\nIt is viewed as a job training program\\naimed at people who show signs of recep-\\ntivity to training and enlisting the participa-\\ntion of employers who provide really pro-\\nductive jobs with potential for upward\\nmobility. The 1.0 million target, spread over\\nthree years, is not purely indicative. It is\\nmeant to be plausible and necessary if full\\nemployment is to be reached by 1980-82 in\\nthe United States.\\nApart from the fact that some public\\nfunds are to be spent on this program, it is\\nnot a typical demand management policy.\\nIt is aimed at increasing the supply of\\ngoods, at raising labor productivity, at sec-\\ntors of the economy where job training can\\nbe accomodated or needed, and at sectors\\nof the labor force. It is basically a supply-\\nside policy and needs for its implementa-\\ntion/assessment a full scale analysis through\\nthe medium of a Leontief-Keynes system.\\nIn first approximations, such assessments\\nhave been made with the appropriate ver-\\nsion of the Wharton Model.\\nIn anticipation of criticism of this policy\\napproach from the side of those who are\\nstrongly wedded to emphasis on demand\\nmanagement, I want to stress that a jobs\\nprogram aimed at increasing productivity\\nand reducing hard core unemployment is\\nnot a futile exercise in pushing some sub-\\nsidized workers into the ranks of the em-\\nployed while pushing others out. The pro-\\ngram is intended to have balance; i.e., to be\\npart of a larger program with correspond-\\ning support from the demand side. Such\\nsupport could not be justified from the\\npoint of view of inflation potential unless\\nsteps are being taken to complement the\\neffect with a jobs program and eventual\\nlifting of productivity. Undue preoccupa-\\ntion with demand policies is not going to be\\nadequate to meet the problems of the day,\\nnor is pure emphasis on supply. Both sides\\nof the economy must be coordinated in\\npolicy formation.\\nIt should also be emphasized that de-\\nmand policies of federal expenditures for\\npublic service employment appear to be in-\\nferior to private sector jobs programs of\\nthe type being mentioned here. In the\\nformer case, there is no long-term oppor-\\ntunity for those taken into the program and\\nthere is no contribution to national produc-\\ntivity. As long as job expenditures are going\\nto be made, they ought, preferably, to be di-\\nrected to an effort that promises to have\\nsome lasting benefit.\\nThis example of the jobs program is one\\nthat fits the contemporary American eco-\\nnomic scene and has been investigated with\\na U.S. model and data. The underlying\\nidea, however, is meant to be much more\\ngeneral. It is that the whole industrial world\\nis faced with a series of new supply-side\\neconomic problems.

These are development of\\nnew, greater energy supplies, protection of\\nthe environment, controlling the exhaustion\\nof resources, enhancing agricultural sup-\\nplies, balancing population development,\\nand others of like nature. The juggling of\\npublic budgets, the setting of tax rates, and\\nthe giving of a tone to money market condi-\\ntions are not going to deal effectively with\\nthis new class of problems, from the view-\\npoints of influencing them in a favorable\\ndirection. Similarly, the demand oriented\\nmodel is not going to provide much under-\\nstanding of them.\\nThe coming problems of the industrial\\neconomy are not going to be wholly dealt\\nwith or analyzed on the basis of the gen-\\neral purpose Leontief-Keynes system that is\\nbeing advocated here. In many cases, the\\nunforeseen problems that are bound to arise\\nare going to be more specialized than can\\nbe conveniently anticipated. In such cases,\\nthe analysis must extend into partial system\\nanalysis giving more detailed and explicit\\ntreatment on the supply side. In terms of\\nmodel building that means construction of\\nmany \"satellite\" systems on the supply side,\\nas the need arises. At the present time,\\nmany energy satellite systems are being de-\\nveloped to deal with new fuel processes,\\nlarge energy using sectors, and large energy\\ndelivery sectors. These satellite systems are\\nthen all linked, in a technical and consistent\\nway, with the input-output cum macro\\nmodel system. In any event, the intent is to\\nmove the discussion of macroeconomics\\nand policy formation to a new plane of dis-\\ncourse.\\nThe discussion, thus far, has focused on\\nthe modeling and related policy problems\\nfor the modern industrial economy. The\\nanalysis of the supply side, however, is not a\\nnew issue for the developing economy. A\\ndeficiency of demand analyzed within the\\nframework of the Keynesian Model has not\\ngenerally been thought to be the issue or\\napproach for dealing with the problems of\\neconomic development. That is not to say\\nthat demand relations are nonexistent or\\nunimportant for the developing economy. It\\nis primarily a matter of emphasis. Avail-\\nability of fixed capital treated as a limiting\\nfactor in production is central to under-\\nstanding the problems facing many develop-\\ning economies.\\nEnergy problems of production and use\\nare already apparent, as are population\\ncontrol and agricultural production. Where\\nproblems of environmental protection and\\nresource exhaustion have not yet arisen,\\nthey are bound to occur in significant in-\\nstances; therefore, it is wise for the develop-\\nment economist to be forearmed with a full\\nmodel for analysis of both supply and de-\\nmand sides.\\nThe centrally planned economies are for\\nthe most part industrial economies and\\nhave the same needs for supply-side analy-\\nsis. In their cases, the supply side has per-\\nhaps been excessively developed with in-\\nadequate attention paid to the demand side,\\nnot from the viewpoint of deficient demand\\nbut from the viewpoint of chronic excess\\ndemand, with latent inflationary pressure.\\nThe present analysis attempts to look at a\\nparticular facet of the modern economy,\\nnamely the supply side. That does not im-\\nply, by any means, that monetary analysis\\nand policy are unimportant. Most of the\\nsupply-side problems have monetary impli-\\ncations or aspects; therefore, monetary\\npolicy must be appropriate to insure the\\nsmooth working of the supply side of the\\neconomy.\\nIn terms of the analytical apparatus\\nneeded to combine monetary analysis with\\nthe kind of supply-demand model that I\\nhave outlined above, it is a matter of inte-\\ngrating the flow-of-funds system together\\nwith the input-output and final demand na-\\ntional income system. It would also be in a\\nfull feedback mode. To complement the\\nsupply-side detail underlying the IS curve,\\nwe would turn to the complete flow-of-\\nfunds model to provide background for the\\nLM curve.\\nIt is my feeling that overall monetary and\\nfiscal policies have been overworked, with\\nexpectations of results that are not j ustified.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Another class of problems concerns\\na desirable long-range mix of technologies\\nof energy supply, conversion and use.

The\\nresult can be politely concealed bewilder-\\nment, possibly a suppressed surge of \"we-\\nand-they\" feeling, in the worst case a grow-\\ning mistrust that only time and sustained\\ninteraction can overcome.\\nI shall try to illustrate the difficulties of\\nsuch interaction by a few examples from re-\\ncent studies involving, besides economics,\\nmostly the natural sciences and engineering.\\nLimitations of experience, background, and\\ntime have compelled me to omit examples\\ninvolving a strong participation from the\\nother social sciences.

The Case for Helium Conservation\\nThis study is described in the preface to\\nthe report of the Helium Study Committee\\nas \"a task that had to be undertaken\\nquickly and completed with great speed.\"\\'\\nLikewise, on the concluding page (40), it is\\ncalled a \"preliminary analysis.\\'\\nThe principal current source of helium is\\nas an optional by-product of the production\\nof natural gas, in which it may occur in con-\\ncentrations ranging (by volume) from 10\\npercent on down with increasing costs of\\nseparation. Present demand for various in-\\ndustrial and space uses falls below present\\nsupply, and a program of storage in the par-\\ntially depleted Cliffside gas field near\\nAmarillo, Texas, is in operation. The study\\nis motivated by the anticipation of a sub-\\nstantially higher future demand.\\nThe report of the Helium Study Com-\\nmittee lists, on pages 35-36, five steps that\\ncan be taken for the purpose of increasing\\nthe rate of storage. I paraphrase:\\nStep i: Stop the current venting of\\nhelium which has been separated from\\nnatural gas allocated as a feedstock to\\npetro-chemical industries. Store the\\nhelium instead.\\nStep ii: Designate helium currently\\nstored in Cliffside a \"national strategic\\nreserve\" for possible major technical\\nchanges that may greatly expand future\\ndemand.\\nStep iii: Reactivate presently idle\\nseparation plants to reduce the release of\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Store\\nthe helium.\\nStep v: Delay the use of helium-rich\\ngas fields, undeveloped, and already pro-\\nducing.\\nUltimate Step: Extract helium from the\\natmosphere.\\nThe ultimate step is not included in the\\nreport of the Committee, but is mentioned\\nin the transcript, page 135, of the Public\\nForum held as part of the study. It involves\\na process that by present technology costs a\\nlarge multiple of the cost of extraction from\\nnatural gas containing .3 to .5 percent\\nhelium.\\nSteps i, iii, iv, and the \"ultimate step\"\\nconsist of successive technical process\\nchoices. Taken in that order, they cor-\\nrespond to the economist\\'s notion of a\\nlong-run supply curve, indicating how the\\ncost of each additional unit of supply is a\\nrising step function of the cumulative sup-\\nply up to that point assuming a constant\\nstate of the technology of extraction. These\\nsteps need to be carried out only according\\nas the expectation of demand growth be-\\ncomes larger and firmer. Steps ii and v are\\nsteps whose timing should depend on ad-\\nditional factors besides the separation cost\\nsequence already mentioned.\\nThe expectation of a much larger demand\\nwell into the twenty-first century is docu-\\nmented, in the report and in the Forum, by\\na fascinating enumeration of anticipated\\nfuture technologies. Many of these are based\\non or may utilize superconductivity, so far\\nattained best by cryogenic techniques for\\nwhich helium is the working fluid. The\\nsuperconductivity is in turn expected to be\\napplicable to a number of uses, such as\\npower transmission with low energy loss,\\nenergy storage, and a number of applica-\\ntions of strong magnetic fields. Among the\\nlatter are several \"technologies that either\\ndo not now exist or are in early stages of\\ndevelopment\" (pp. 13-18), such as magnetic\\ncontainment for nuclear fusion reactors.\\nAnother possible application is magneto-\\nhydrodynamic (MHD) power generation\\nthat converts some of the energy contained\\nin a high temperature gas stream from either\\na coal-fired burner or a nuclear fission reac-\\ntor directly into electricity, instead of rout-\\ning all the energy through a conventional\\nsteam cycle. The MHD development is\\nfurther along in the Soviet Union. There\\nalso is a development furthest along in\\nWest Germany and Japan-of magnetically\\nlevitated low-noise high-speed trains.\\nIt should be added that research is in\\nprogress on the use of aluminum and pos-\\nsibly other materials reaching low resistivity\\nat temperatures of 20-30?K, a range reach-\\nable using liquid hydrogen as a coolant.\\n(See L. A. Hall, National Bureau of Stan-\\ndards Report, and E. B. Forsyth et al.)\\nFrom the economic point of view, the\\ncase for the helium storage program is not\\nconvincingly made either in the report or\\nin the Forum. I have not found either cost\\nor benefit estimates for the program. Ac-\\ntually, because of the importance of energy\\nsupply processes among the increased uses\\nof helium listed above, the benefits cannot\\nbe estimated without comparable cost and\\nfuel availability estimates for alternative\\nenergy supply and use technologies which\\nhave low or zero helium requirements. In\\nother words, to assess the helium storage\\nprogram, one also needs a long-run model\\nof the energy sector of the economy that\\naddresses the second decision problem of\\nTable 1. One will, of course, also need to\\nconsider other important helium uses that\\nare not directly energy related.\\nBefore turning to problem (2), I draw at-\\ntention to a few passages in the Helium Re-\\nport that will provide background for Sec-\\ntions III and IV below, where I shall discuss\\nthe choice of measures of value in which to\\nexpress benefits and costs. The report\\n(p. 23) contains an important piece of in-\\nformation bearing on cost comparisons, to\\nthe effect that the energy requirements for\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

In a description of the possible role\\nof the government in implementing the five\\nsteps, the report says: \"The burden of the\\ndiscount rate as a criterion of performance\\ncould be eliminated and the present debt to\\nthe U.S. Treasury written off\\' (p. 38). I\\nshall explain in Section IV why I think not\\nmany economists will support the proposal\\nto eliminate the criterion of the discount\\nrate. Meanwhile, the statement leads one to\\ninfer that the capital cost component is not\\nnegligible as a factor in the decision.\\nII. Technology Mixes of Future\\nEnergy Supply and Use\\nMy second illustration is a study that was\\ncarried out as an input to the deliberations\\nof the Committee on Nuclear and Alterna-\\ntive Energy Systems (CONAES, in short),\\nand of its Synthesis Panel. It is entitled\\n\"Energy Modeling for an Uncertain Fu-\\nture.\" As explained in the preface, it is a\\n\"supporting paper\" published without hav-\\ning gone through the customary report re-\\nview procedure of the Academy. While for\\nthe other illustrations I have not named\\nauthors or committee chairpersons, I\\nshould not conceal that I was the chairman\\nof the group, called the Modeling Resource\\nGroup (MRG), which collectively did the\\nwork described in its Report. The group\\nconsisted mostly of economists and opera-\\ntions researchers, two somewhat like-minded\\nprofessions. My comments on interdisci-\\nplinary interactions about the ideas and\\nfindings of the group will therefore draw\\non discussions with members of other pro-\\nfessions within and outside CONA ES.\\nFor that purpose it may suffice to give\\nonly the briefest description of the ques-\\ntions addressed, the assumptions made, and\\nthe methods used. One important question\\narises from the fact that several competing\\nobjectives enter into the choice of a long-\\nrun energy technology mix. The net eco-\\nnomic effect (economic benefit minus cost)\\nof the development of a given technology\\nmix can be estimated in a crude way, as sug-\\ngested in Table 1, column (a), by its effect\\non the Gross National Product (GNP). In\\naddition, one will also want to register risks\\nof adverse effects such as mining accidents,\\nair pollution, acid rain, oil spills, possible\\nleakage from nuclear waste disposal, or di-\\nversion or proliferation of weapons-grade\\nnuclear materials. For brevity, all such ef-\\nfects will be called \"environmental\" effects.\\nThe place in Table 1 for these impacts is\\ncolumn (b), tersely dubbed \"health and\\nlife.\"\\nThe Risk/Impact Panel of CONAES de-\\ncided not to try to estimate money equiva-\\nlents for such adverse impacts of various\\nmagnitudes. Were such estimates possible\\nand available, then one could also define\\nand find a balance between desired benefits\\nand adverse \"environmental\" impacts that\\nremain after scrubbers, inspectors, Civex\\nand the like have done their jobs. Not hav-\\ning such estimates, the MRG turned the\\nquestion around: Assume that tentatively\\nchosen upper bounds are imposed on the\\nuse of technologies that have such impacts.\\nEstimate the loss in GNP associated with\\nthese bounds. Then that number also places\\na price tag on the reduction in \"environ-\\nmental\" impacts achieved by those bounds.\\nThus, even if an a priori valuation of the\\nreduction in impacts is not available, then\\nsuch a valuation is still implicit in any\\ndecision actually taken. It may help the\\ndecision makers to know these implicit\\nprice tags.\\nI will list only the principal assumptions\\nmade for this purpose. Numerical values\\nwere assigned to three sets of variables. As\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

This\\nprocedure was carried out for each of three\\nlong-run models of the U.S. energy sector.\\nThe numerical inputs into the three models\\nwere the same for almost all realization and\\nblend variables, except for the price and in-\\ncome elasticities of demand, which were\\nspecific to each model. Two ideas central to\\ncurrent economic analysis entered into this\\nprocedure. One is the use of an optimiza-\\ntion algorithm to simulate the behavior of a\\ncompetitive market economy, in any one\\nyear, and through time. The other is the use\\nof long-run elasticities of demand. For de-\\nmand by end-use consumers, these are to be\\nbased on econometric analysis of time-\\nseries and/or cross sections of income,\\nprices, and quantities consumed. For in-\\ndustrial demand, a process analysis of al-\\nternative industrial energy-using processes\\nmay add valuable information.\\nThe principal finding was the propor-\\ntionally small effect on GNP of sizable cuts\\nin energy use below its base case growth\\npath. In interpreting this finding, note that\\nthe optimization procedure implies an as-\\nsumption whereby the economy responds to\\nanticipated changes by minimizing the cost\\nof adaptation. The principal means of adap-\\ntation are changes in the type and composi-\\ntion of the capital equipment for the ex-\\ntraction, conversion, transport, and use of\\nenergy-at the regular time for replace-\\nment or earlier.\\nTable 2 shows the numerical results. For\\ntwo models, with price elasticities of -.25\\nand -.4, respectively, policies entailing per-\\ncentage cuts in energy use out of the base\\ncase that gradually increase to between 10\\nand 20 percent in the year 2010, were found\\nto cut not more than 2 percent out of the\\ndiscounted sum of annual real GNP, 1975-\\n2010, and a comparably small percentage\\nout of GNP for the single year 2010. The\\ninstruments of the curtailment of growth in\\nenergy use were, in row (1) of the table, the\\nplacement of bounds on specific energy sup-\\nply technologies described above. In row\\n(2), a zero-energy-growth path is simulated\\nby the imposition of a hypothetical \"con-\\nservation tax\" on primary energy flows. The\\nrate of this fictitious tax must increase as\\nthe GNP continues to grow in spite of the\\ndownward pull from the zero-energy-growth\\npath.\\nAnother finding, reported in row (2), was\\nthat for the effects of the larger cuts in\\nenergy use, the value of the long-run price\\nelasticity of demand for energy becomes\\ncrucial. In a sensitivity analysis made with\\none model, a zero-energy-growth policy\\nfrom 1975 on, leading to a 60 percent cut in\\nenergy use out of the base case in 2010,\\nwas found to induce only a 2 percent cut in\\ncumulative discounted GNP if that price\\nelasticity is -.5, but a 30 percent cut if it is\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Interdisciplinary Differences in Outlook\\nWe have now assembled enough reference\\nmaterial for us to make a start with our\\nmain topic-the way in which differences in\\noutlook between the disciplines affect the\\nconduct and evaluation of joint studies.\\nThe most significant difference between\\neconomics and the natural sciences lies in\\nthe opportunities for testing and verification\\nof hypotheses. Jacob Marschak used to say\\nthat economists carry the combined bur-\\ndens of meteorologists and engineers. Like\\nthe meteorologists, they are expected to pre-\\ndict the future course of important vari-\\nables in their field of study. Just as engi-\\nneers design more and more efficient\\nmachines, economists are also expected to\\nimprove the design of society where it af-\\nfects good use of resources. But, like the\\nmeteorologist, the economist has tradi-\\ntionally been confined to drawing inferences\\nfrom passive observations, records of data\\ngenerated by the turbulence of the at-\\nmosphere or the fluctuations and trends of\\neconomic life. Finally-a very important\\ndifference-meteorologists and engineers\\nhave all the laws and measurements es-\\ntablished by physics and chemistry avail-\\nable to them, fully documented by experi-\\nmental tests and results.\\nTraditionally, economists have not\\nsearched for similar inputs from experi-\\nmental or observational research of a\\npsychological or sociological nature. In the\\n1950\\'s and early 1960\\'s they have engaged\\nin some experimentation of their own on be-\\nhavior under uncertainty and in bargaining\\nand gaming situations. However, the find-\\nings of this work have not been put to use\\nas premises for modeling an entire economy.\\nFor that purpose, over a few articulate pro-\\ntests, many economists have been satisfied\\nto postulate simple rules of behavior by\\nconsumers and business firms. The terms\\n\"introspection\" and \"casual empiricism\"\\nhave been used to describe the cognitive\\nsources of these premises. In the version of\\nthe currently dominant \"neoclassical\"\\nschool of thought, these premises express\\noptimizing responses of demand and supply\\nto a uniform price system: satisfaction\\nmaximizing by consumers, profit maximiz-\\ning by firms.\\nThese premises have a certain intuitive\\nplausibility about them. Undoubtedly, their\\nwidespread adoption has also been aided by\\nthe richness of the body of inferences one\\ncan draw from them. In fact, the premises\\nform the logical foundation for the paradigm\\nof neoclassical economics: the concept of an\\nequilibrium of prices and quantities that in\\nsome way ties together the economic de-\\ncisions taken by all seemingly independent\\nagents. Conceptually the prices and the\\nquantity responses may describe a sta-\\ntionary state over an extended period of\\ntime. More realistically, they may be dated\\nvariables and thus also link decisions that\\nvary over successive periods, to sustain a\\nmoving intertemporal equilibrium.\\nParenthetically, use of the term equi-\\nlibrium does not imply an assumption that\\n\\n\\n###',\n",
       " 'conomics-1979-0-09.tx',\n",
       " 'the real economy actually is at any time \"in\\nequilibrium.\" Rather, the notion of equi-\\nlibrium is a first approximation, a reference\\npoint or path, like the cycles of Ptolemy\\nwithout the epicycles and the eccentricity.\\nIf the market were to extend to all per-\\ntinent economic decisions over the entire\\nperiod considered, the result of an inter-\\ntemporal equilibrium would be an \"ef-\\nficient\" path of the economy in the limited\\nsense that no one can be made better off at\\nany time without someone being made\\nworse off at some time. Where market\\npower interferes with competition, or where\\nimportant economic decisions are made at\\ngovernment levels, the instinct of the neo-\\nclassical economist is to recommend that\\nlegislation, regulation, the use of suitable\\nincentives, or direct government decision\\neither restore or mimic the operation of the\\ncompetitive market.\\nIn the present context, an important trait\\nof the neoclassical model is that it does not\\npostulate one sole primary resource, be it\\nlabor, energy or any other, whose scarcity\\ncontrols that of all other goods, and which\\nthereby becomes a natural unit of value for\\nall other goods. The model of production is\\nsuch that-not by logical necessity, but as\\nan empirical fact--any primary input to\\nproduction can be substituted to some ex-\\ntent for any other. If such substitution does\\nnot take place within one-and-the-same\\nproduction process, then it can still come\\nabout through suitable changes in the levels\\nof several processes and in the inputs to\\nthese. In this view \"the energy problem\" is\\nnot one of just \"saving energy,\" regardless\\nof the cost in other resources. It is rather\\none of seeing to it that the increasing real\\ncost of domestic energy extraction and sup-\\nply, and the increased market power of\\nOPEC, are-over time-reflected in the\\nreal prices of primary energy forms relative\\nto other primary inputs, and thereby in dif-\\nferent degrees in the prices of all other\\ngoods and services. In the projections de-\\nscribed above, the energy prices are cal-\\nculated so as to be in balance with an ef-\\nficient path of the technology mix into the\\nfuture, and thereby to induce the right\\namount of energy saving. In particular if, as\\nprojected by MRG, real prices of primary\\nenergy rise in this path, then energy use is\\nprojected to grow less than proportionally\\nto GNP.\\nThe contrary doctrine-that regardless of\\nprices there is a persistent relationship be-\\ntween energy use and GNP-has frequently\\nbeen expressed in the engineering literature.\\nIn line with this observation, the MRG find-\\ning of a possible small impact on GNP of\\nincisive bounds on specific energy tech-\\nnologies led to lively correspondence and\\ndiscussions with members of CONA ES, and\\nof its Supply/Delivery Panel, an engineer-\\ning-oriented group. I should add that the\\nMRG study was not the first modeling study\\nto cast doubt on the doctrine referred to.\\nBy my knowledge the first was a study by\\nEdward Hudson and Dale Jorgenson.\\nIV. Discounting Future Benefits and Costs\\nWe are now ready for a closer look at the\\ndiscounting of future benefits and costs.\\nThis practice reflects a simple technological\\nfact combined with the paradigm of equi-\\nlibrium over time. The simple fact is that-\\nshort of capital saturation-society can\\ntemporarily curtail the production of cur-\\nrent consumption goods by transferring\\nsome factors of production to the forma-\\ntion of additional suitable capital goods,\\nin such a way as to return a multiple (> 1) of\\nthe same unit bundle of consumption goods\\nin the future. Efficient intertemporal equi-\\nlibrium then demands that the present\\nvalue of the goods returned to consump-\\ntion be equal to that of the goods not now\\nconsumed. The quantity of the future\\nbundle being larger, its per-unit present\\nvalue must be correspondingly lower. In a\\nprojection that gives to one unit of the fu-\\nture bundle a future real market price nu-\\nmerically equal to its current price, a dis-\\ncount factor d < 1 must be applied to the\\nfuture market price to obtain the present\\nvalue, per unit of the future bundle. Given\\ncompetitive markets for capital, present\\ngoods and future goods, and ignoring dif-\\nferences in risk, different investments bear-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The usual practice in cost-benefit analyses\\nis to assume also that rt is independent of\\nt, rt = r, say.\\nThis reasoning simply registers the eco-\\nnomic accounting implications of assumed\\nintertemporal efficiency with capital non-\\nsaturation. To many highly educated\\npeople, there is something ethically offen-\\nsive about it.\\nA difficult practical problem on which\\neconomists still differ among themselves is\\nhow to read a good estimate for r from\\ncapital market and other data. Different tax\\nrates on corporate and individual incomes\\ncomplicate the problem. Considering this\\nand various market imperfections, the pre-\\ncluded alternative use of funds drawn upon\\nfor a public project also enters into the\\nchoice of r. I will not venture into these\\nquestions here.\\nComing back to helium storage, the dis-\\ncounting criterion would lead most econo-\\nmists to recommend that those steps of the\\nstorage program be implemented for which\\nthe rate of return on the total investment\\n(not that on energy alone) exceeds or equals\\nthe discount rate appropriate to the prob-\\nlem. Step i, storing helium currently vented,\\nis likely to meet the test. The problem is to\\nestimate which of the four or six steps\\nwould.\\nTwo final remarks, the first added as an\\nafterthought since August 30.\\nThe two issues we have discussed-\\nwhether to count only energy costs or all\\ncosts, and whether or not to discount future\\nbenefits and costs-are logically distinct\\nimplications of the notion of intertemporal\\nequilibrium. However, psychologically they\\nare related. If one counts only energy costs,\\neverything is expressible in equivalent\\nBtu\\'s, and to the physicist, steeped in the\\nlaw of conservation of energy, Btu\\'s are the\\nsame everywhere and at all times. To dis-\\ncount future Btu\\'s therefore seems not just\\nstrange but outright wrong. So it is. But the\\neconomist does not discount quantities of\\nany kind. He discounts only real values,\\nthat is, quantities (including energy) multi-\\nplied by real prices that reflect the expected\\nbalance of cost and preference as of a\\nspecified future time and beyond. It is to\\nthese prices that the discount factor is ap-\\nplied. I am hoping that this simple distinc-\\ntion may help to reduce misunderstanding\\nbetween the professions.\\nSecondly, our reasoning has proceeded\\nblandly as if there were no uncertainty about\\nthe outcome of the development of processes\\nexpected to be substantial users of helium.\\nIf there is considerable uncertainty, econo-\\nmists may want to add an allowance for risk\\nto the discount rate. They may also wish to\\nexperiment with models in which judg-\\nmental probabilities are attached to these\\nuncertain outcomes. This device may pro-\\nduce insights even if the conclusions de-\\npend on admittedly uncertain premises. A\\nstudy of this kind is included as chapter IV\\nin the MRG report.\\nV. Attaching Values to Health and Life\\nThe question of estimating the value of\\nhealth and the value of life arises mostly in\\ncontexts where either public decisions, or\\npublic monitoring of private decisions, can\\nbe shaped so as to improve health and pro-\\nlong life. One example is the investment of\\npublic funds to diminish physical risks to\\ntraffic by the design of roads, bridges, turn-\\nouts, and crossings. Another is regular ex-\\npenditures for traffic police, building in-\\nspectors, and other law enforcers who\\nrestrain some people from killing or hurt-\\ning themselves or others by recklessness or\\nneglect.\\nA common trait of these decisions is that\\nfrom good experience records one may be\\nable to estimate the years of lives saved,\\nperhaps also of health and limbs preserved,\\nper dollar spent on efficiently run projects\\nor activities of this kind. Such calculations\\nmake it possible to spot discrepancies be-\\ntween different projects in regard to \"health\\n\\n\\n###',\n",
       " 'conomics-1979-0-11.tx',\n",
       " 'and life benefits\" bought per dollar spent.\\nThe ideal of equilibrium then suggests re-\\ndistributing expenditures, if needed, in or-\\nder to maximize total benefits from the\\ngiven expenditure for protection. Valua-\\ntions of health or life that have a modicum\\nof public approval could result from such\\nredistribution. Note that these valuations,\\nalso called shadowv prices, are in efTect set by\\nthe budgetary decision makers, whether\\nthey are aware of it or not.\\nAfter such redistribution if called for, the\\ncalculation of money values of health and\\nlife registers what in good practice we con-\\nsistently spend to save a life. The process\\nrecognizes that, disturbing as it is to our\\nsensibilities, society is being compelled by\\nthe facts of technology and behavior to set\\nup equivalences between lives of unidenti-\\nfied people and bundles of goods and ser-\\nvices implicitly of the same market or\\nshadow value - --thus bracketing contem-\\nporary lives together with current goods\\nand services in the same category of ex-\\nchangeables.\\nThe examples given so far concern small\\nto moderate risks affecting small to moder-\\nate numbers of people, less than 100 at a\\ntime, say. Moreover, the time intervals be-\\ntween the decision to commit funds for the\\nreduction of risks, the actual expenditure of\\nthese funds, and the reaping of benefits\\ntherefrom are moderate, less than twenty\\nyears, say. Finally, the problems are mostly\\nlocal or national, not international in scope.\\nThe long-run choices between energy\\ntechnology mixes are different in these re-\\nspects. By a gradual shift from oil and gas\\nto coal, fossil fuels can remain a principal\\nsource of energy for countries with abun-\\ndant resources of coal, especially the United\\nStates, the USSR, and China, for a long\\ntime to come. Intensive current discussion\\nwith regard to this option concerns the pos-\\nsible climatic effects of the increase in the\\natmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide\\ncaused by continued large-scale combus-\\ntion of fossil fuels or their derivatives,\\nalongside with world-wide deforestation.\\nAmong the large-scale effects held pos-\\nsible are an increase in average global\\ntemperature, entailing dislocation of agri-\\nculture depending on how each region is\\naffected, and an increase in the level of the\\noceans due to the melting of polar ice not\\npreviously floating. The present state of\\nknowledge is not such as to be ready for an\\nassessment of these risks. New hypotheses\\nand observations appear regularly in the\\npages of Science and other journals. So I\\nwould describe this problem as involving an\\nunknown risk to a large number of people.\\nIf current estimates of the capital cost of\\ncentral station solar power are realistic, the\\nprincipal alternative to fossil fuels for bulk\\npower generation is nuclear power. I am\\nnot qualified to even comment on the reac-\\ntor safety and waste disposal problems. I\\nassume, however, that the developers of\\nthese technologies would classify these\\nproblems in terms of very small risks to\\nsubstantial numbers of people. Perhaps this\\nleaves as the principal concern the difficulty\\nof keeping industrial and weapons use of\\nnuclear materials apart. Since on this one\\nwe are all groping in the dark, I feel I should\\ndescribe this aspect of nuclear technology\\nas an unknown risk to a very large number\\nof people.\\nI cannot see my way through to a calcu-\\nlus of the value of human lives in large\\nnumbers, that would help clarify issues of\\nthe scope of those just discussed although\\nestimates of numbers of lives at risk are\\nand will remain important. These are\\nbasically problems for judgment, even\\nthough the need for making these judg-\\nments will weigh hard on the people called\\nupon to make them. But supposing I should\\nbe wrong, let me point to one apparent\\nparadox to be faced in any attempt to\\nbring a calculus of the shadow price of\\nhuman life to bear on problems with a long\\ntime span.\\nSuppose one accepts as an ethical prin-\\nciple that, in balancing risks to human life\\nin the present and in the future, equal num-\\nbers of lives should receive equal weight.\\nThis would make the present value of the\\nfuture human life independent of the time\\nat which it is lived. However, we have seen\\nthat as long as capital saturation is not at-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",
       " 'conomics-1979-0-12.tx',\n",

Hence the present value\\nof future life relative to that of future goods\\nwill be much higher than the value of present\\nlife in relation to present goods. It should\\nnot be inferred from this that future de-\\ncision makers are assumed or advised to de-\\nvote greater resources to safety and health\\nthan the present decision makers, although\\nthe future ones may well want to do this for\\nreasons of their own. The inference is rather,\\nI submit, that the present values I have de-\\nscribed reflect a curious mixture of three\\ningredients: one intertemporal ethical rule,\\npresent preferences between consumption\\nand protection, and an assumption about\\nsavings behavior of all generations within\\nthe next fifty years, say. Under these as-\\nsumptions, sets of \"present values\" formed\\nat successive points in time need not, and\\ngenerally will not, be consistent with each\\nother.\\nVI. The Empirical Basis of\\nQuantitative Economics\\nI now go on to a discussion of the em-\\npirical basis for some of the quantitative\\nstatements that economics contributes to\\ninterdisciplinary studies. I will again il-\\nlustrate this question with reference to the\\nfew studies I have chosen as examples. At\\nthe same time I will emphasize the role that\\nthe premises underlying the concept of\\nequilibrium play in this process.\\nThe premise of profit maximization im-\\nplies a subpremise of cost minimization.\\nI regard that subpremise as fitting reality\\nmore closely than the entire premise. It\\nunderlies the supply side of the MRG study\\nof future energy technology mixes I have\\ndescribed.\\nThe premise of maximization of satis-\\nfaction by the consumer can be made more\\nplausible and more applicable by a further\\nspecification. Applied to energy, it says that\\nsuccessive equal additions to a consumer\\'s\\nannual energy end-use budget are worth\\nless and less to him. Operationally, how\\nmuch each successive addition is worth to\\nhim can be measured, for instance, by that\\nincrease in the expenditure for the rest of\\nhis consumption that he would have re-\\ngarded as equivalent to each next addition\\nto his energy consumption.\\nThis specification implies the existence of\\na household demand function for energy, in\\nwhich per capita demand for energy de-\\ncreases as its price increases, and increases\\nas per capita real income increases. The\\nMRG extended this concept to the sum of\\ndirect and indirect demand for energy, the\\nlatter being the energy used as input to the\\nproduction of all nonenergy goods, includ-\\ning capital goods as well. Another exten-\\nsion distinguishes demand for individual\\nfuels, where the demand for one fuel in-\\ncreases if the price of another competing\\nfuel goes up.\\nThese functions are then estimated from\\nempirical data. In the procedure followed\\nin the model with the estimated long-run\\nprice elasticity of -.4 mentioned above, a\\nparametric form of these functions was\\nfitted to cross-section and time-series data\\nfor seven OECD countries, including the\\nUnited States, for the period 1955-72. In\\nthe model with price elasticity -.25 the\\nestimation procedure was not stated with\\ncomparable explicitness. In both models the\\nestimated long-run demand functions,\\nwritten with price as a function of quantity,\\nwere then integrated to estimate the benefit\\nfrom the consumption of energy in all\\nforms.\\nBy comparison, the empirical basis for\\nthe production side is more direct. Each of\\nthe various competing energy producing,\\nconverting, and using processes is repre-\\nsented by constant ratios of inputs to out-\\nputs, reflecting operating experience where\\navailable, or based on estimates of such\\nratios and of future availability dates for\\nprocesses not yet developed. For instance,\\nprocess estimates for the years 1985 and\\n2000 were drawn upon in estimating the\\nelasticity of substitution between electric\\nand nonelectric energy in the second of the\\ntwo models just discussed. This did con-\\nstrain but not by itself imply numerical\\nestimates of the elasticities of demand for\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'energy, whether in toto (given as -.25), or\\nfor the two components.\\nThis completes my description of the em-\\npirical basis for the MRG procedures and\\nthe premises on which they rest. I want,\\nin passing, to draw attention at this point\\nto the econometric aspects of another\\nstudy, designed to estimate perceived bene-\\nfits of air quality improvements from resi-\\ndential property values in areas with dif-\\nferent air quality. The study is entitled \"The\\nCosts and Benefits of Automobile Emis-\\nsion Controls.\" It draws on a body of\\neconometric work in which property values\\nare related to various characteristics of the\\nsite and the neighborhood, including air\\nquality and other environmental amenities,\\nand the income of the household.\\nThe foregoing examples lead me to some\\nbroader remarks on the empirical basis of\\nquantitative economic knowledge in gen-\\neral, not limited to the type of studies we\\nare here mostly concerned with.\\nIn all formal procedures involving sta-\\ntistical testing or estimation, there are ex-\\nplicitly stated but untested hypotheses,\\noften called \"maintained\" hypotheses by\\nstatisticians. In the econometric studies we\\nhave here considered, the \"premises\" al-\\nready discussed play that role. More in\\ngeneral, any statement resulting from such\\nstudies retains the form of an \"if ... then . . .\"\\nstatement. The set of \"ifs,\" sometimes called\\n\"the model,\" is crucial to the meaning of\\nthe \"thens,\" usually but somewhat inac-\\ncurately called the \"findings.\" For instance,\\nin fitting demand relations, the principal\\nmaintained hypotheses specify the variables\\nentering into these relations, and possibly\\nother variables with which these variables\\nare in turn linked in other pertinent rela-\\ntions.\\nThe \"if ... then ...\" statements are simi-\\nlar to those in the formal sciences. They\\nread like logical or mathematical reasoning\\nin the case of economic theory, and like ap-\\nplications of statistical methods in the case\\nof econometric estimation or testing. The\\nheart of substantive economics is what can\\nbe learned about the validity of the \"ifs\"\\nthemselves, including the \"premises\" dis-\\ncussed above. \"Thens\" contradicted by ob-\\nservation call, as time goes on, for modifica-\\ntion of the list of \"ifs\" used. Absence of\\nsuch contradiction gradually conveys sur-\\nvivor status to the \"ifs\" in question. So I do\\nthink a certain record of noncontradiction\\ngradually becomes one of tentative con-\\nfirmation. But the process of confirmation\\nis slow and diffuse.\\nFor some purposes, and at considerable\\nexpense, short cuts can be made to di-\\nminish the dependence on untested \"ifs.\" I\\nam speaking of systematic experiments such\\nas the so-called negative income tax ex-\\nperiment conducted in New Jersey over the\\nperiod 1968-72, and followed by similar in-\\ncome maintenance experiments in other\\nareas of the United States. If one wants to\\nknow whether income maintenance pay-\\nments to families near the poverty line have\\na disincentive effect, or no effect, or even a\\npositive incentive effect on labor supply,\\none does not need to have a pretested theory\\nas to what, if anything, the family is maxi-\\nmizing. Instead, one can make such pay-\\nments to a sample of families and com-\\npare its behavior with that of an unaided\\ncontrol group. This is what the New Jersey\\nexperiment did. In one category of families\\nwhere the numbers spoke rather clearly-\\nwhite husband-and-wife whole families-\\nthe effect on labor supply was found to be\\nnegative, moderate but statistically sig-\\nnificant, and with the effect on the husband\\'s\\nlabor supply smaller than that on the wife\\'s.\\nIn addition, much was learned about the de-\\nsign, conduct, and evaluation of such ex-\\nperiments for use in later studies.\\nThere have not been many such experi-\\nments on a scale needed to obtain sta-\\ntistically significant outcomes. Moreover,\\nthey have been limited to questions of\\ngreat and urgent policy importance. Mean-\\nwhile, we do need to find ways in which\\nverification of the premises of economics,\\nthrough cumulative econometric analyses\\nand through experiments that find a spon-\\nsor, can be pursued.\\nI have not found in the literature a per-\\nsuasive account of how such confirmation\\nof premises can be perceived and docu-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The things missed are very\\nimportant.\"\\'\\nA life scientist: \"Market imperfection\\nis more widespread than economists care to\\nadmit.\"\\nAn economist: \"Where economists see\\nthe invisible hand guiding the market place\\nto produce pretty good outcomes, scientists\\nsee only chaos.\"\\nAn engineer: \"The economic motive is\\noverrated.\"\\nA psychologist: \"All the conclusions\\nthat are drawn from the assumption of ra-\\ntionality can also be drawn from assump-\\ntions of adaptive behavior.\"\\nA life scientist: \"Economists have great\\nskill in handling data. However, they tend\\nto ask only for data, not for concepts and\\nideas. Drawing up a model is an inter-\\ndisciplinary task.\"\\nAn engineer: \"Economists often use\\nsmooth production functions even when\\nengineers might be reluctant to do so.\"\\nA life scientist: \"Many scientists do not\\nunderstand discounting.\"\\nAn engineer: \"Economics is the Ther-\\nmodynarnics of the Social Sciences. Every-\\nthing is deduced from a few simple postu-\\nlates without the necessity for knowing\\ndetailed mechanisms.\"\\nVIII. Final Remarks\\nAfter this instructive intermezzo, allow\\nme a few final words. I will not be able to\\nmatch the brevity and incisiveness we just\\nsavored.

I am not sufficiently well read\\nto provide that kind of survey. To make my\\npoint about the persistence of the market-\\nefficiency market-failure tension, I took a\\nshort cut. I went back to reread Pigou\\'s\\nLapses from Full Employment, a little book I\\nremember having been assigned to read as a\\nstudent just after the war. And that in turn\\nsent me back to its parent book, Pigou\\'s\\nTheory of Unemployment. The Preface to\\nThe Theory of Unemployment is dated April\\n1933, after a decade of poor performance\\nand relatively high unemployment in Great\\nBritain, well into the Great Depression, and\\nbefore the publication of the General The-\\nory. The Preface to Lapses from Full Em-\\nployment (another example of a revealing\\nvocabulary) is dated November 1944, after\\nfive years of the war that put an end to the\\ndepression, and well after the appearance of\\nthe General Theory. That seemed like an\\ninteresting approach to the historical ques-\\ntion, because current controversies in\\nmacro-economic theory are often described\\nas a debate between \"Keynesians\" and\\nothers- \"monetarists,\" \"Classicals,\" or\\n\" equilibrium theorists\" - and because\\nPigou, besides being a great economist, was\\nin particular the embodiment of the\\nMarshallian tradition, the leading figure in\\nthe \"classical economics\" that the Keynes-\\nian revolution was explicitly intended to\\noverthrow.\\nLapses makes interesting rereading. It em-\\nphasizes the money wage, whereas its prede-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'cessor was written almost entirely in terms\\nof the real wage. The general macro-theo-\\nretic framework, in which the discussion of\\nthe labor market is embedded, clearly has\\nan eye on Keynes. The underlying model\\ncould be IS-LM without doing much vio-\\nlence to the argument. There are little\\nanachronisms: Pigou tends to think of the\\ninterest rate as being determined in the\\ngoods market (by Savings = Investment) and\\nnominal income as being determined by\\nthe demand for money. Today we take\\nsimultaneity seriously, but the General The-\\nory more or less speaks as if real output is\\ndetermined in the goods market and the\\ninterest rate by liquidity preference. After\\nwhat is to me a confusing description\\nof a Keynesian low-level liquidity-trap\\nequilibrium, Pigou invokes the Pigou effect\\nto explain why the low level might not be as\\nlow as all that and then, characteristically,\\nremarks that none of it is very important in\\npractice anyway. All this is relevant here\\nonly as background for the treatment of the\\nlabor market.\\nPigou says the obvious thing first, and I\\nagree that it is the first thing to say: if there\\nis \"thorough-going competition\" among\\nworkers, then the only possible equilibrium\\nposition is at full employment. That is little\\nmore than a definition of equilibrium. He is\\naware that he is taking a lot of dynamics for\\ngranted. Expectations of falling wages could\\nperversely reduce the demand for labor; and\\nhe discusses the possibility that under some\\nconditions, with the interest rate at its prac-\\ntical floor, nominal wage rates and prices\\nmay chase each other down and thus pre-\\nvent the real-wage adjustment needed for an\\nincrease in employment. (This is where the\\nPigou effect makes its appearance, of\\ncourse.)\\nIt is what comes next that interests me. It\\nis obvious to Pigou, writing in 1944, that the\\nlabor market does not behave as if workers\\nwere engaged in thorough-going competi-\\ntion for jobs. With the common sense that\\nseems somehow to have escaped his modem\\nday successors, he wonders why it does not.\\nAnd he discusses three or four of the institu-\\ntional factors that a reasonable person\\nwould mention even now as obstacles to the\\nclassical functioning of the labor market.\\nFirst of all, he realizes that the labor\\nmarket is segmented. Not everyone in it is\\nin competition with everyone else. I am not\\nreferring here to the obvious fact that abili-\\nties, experience, and skills differ, so that\\nunemployed laborers can not compete for\\nthe jobs held by craftsmen. That fact of life\\nmerely reminds us that \"labor\" is not a\\nwell-defined homogeneous factor of produc-\\ntion. Even within skill categories or occupa-\\ntional groups, however, workers have ties to\\nlocalities, to industries, to special job classi-\\nfications, even to individual employers.\\nThese ties can be broken, but not easily. It\\nis interesting to me that even the Theory of\\nUnemployment of 1933 devotes a lot of space\\nto the analysis of a labor market in\\nwhich there are many \"centers of em-\\nployment\"-to use the neutral term chosen\\nby Pigou to describe segmentation of the\\nlabor market-between which mobility is\\nabsent or slow. Of course he observes that\\neven in a completely segmented labor\\nmarket, if there is thorough-going competi-\\ntion within segments, full employment will\\nbe the rule, although there may be wage\\ndifferentials between centers of employment\\nfor otherwise identical workers. I think that\\nthe fact of segmentation is very important,\\nnot only because it limits the scope of com-\\npetition but because its pervasiveness sug-\\ngests-though it can not prove-that habit\\nand custom play a large role in labor market\\nbehavior. From the prominence that he\\ngives it, I gather that Pigou might have\\nagreed.\\nA second factor, which has been more\\noften discussed, is trade unionism. Pigou\\ndoes not have very much to say about col-\\nlective bargaining, but what he says makes\\nsense.\\nOf course, these agencies in their deci-\\nsions have regard to the general state\\nof the demand for labour; they will\\nhave no wish to set wage rates so high\\nthat half the people of the country are\\nthrown out of work. Nevertheless,\\nthere is reason to believe that they do\\nnot have regard to demand conditions\\nin such degree as would be necessary\\nto secure, as thorough-going competi-\\ntion would do, the establishment of\\nfull employment.

       " 'Later on in the book, Pigou makes an ob-\\nservation that is not explicitly connected\\nwith collective bargaining. He does connect\\nit with \"actual life\" however, and it fits\\norganized workers very well, and perhaps\\nothers besides:\\nIn periods of expansion employers\\nmight be willing to agree to substantial\\nadvances in wage rates if they\\nwere confident that, when prosperity\\nended, they would be able to cancel\\nthem. They know, however, that in\\nfact this will not be easy, that elab-\\norate processes will have to be gone\\nthrough, and that their work-people\\nwill put up a strong rear-guard ac-\\ntion... . In periods of depression\\nwage-earners, for precisely similar rea-\\nsons, hold out against wage reduc-\\ntions, which they might be ready to\\nconcede if it were not for the difficulty\\nthat they foresee in getting them\\ncancelled when times improve.... A\\nwidespread desire for \\'safety first\\'\\nhelps to make wage rates sticky.\\n[1945, p. 48]\\nThese casual remarks raise more questions\\nthan they answer about the determination\\nof nominal wages by collective bargaining.\\nThe first excerpt can be taken as a redefini-\\ntion of full employment when the labor\\nmarket is not competitive; the second, how-\\never, advances an account of wage sticki-\\nness and is therefore on a different footing.\\nIt would help to explain the failure of the\\nlabor market to clear on any reasonable\\ndefinition, and thus provide a connection\\nbetween nominal demand and real output.\\nThe third institutional factor mentioned\\nby Pigou has also been the subject of much\\nanalysis, past and present: the provision of\\nunemployment insurance. There are several\\nchannels by which the availability of unem-\\nployment compensation can add to the re-\\ncorded amount of unemployment. The\\nprolongation of search is only the most\\nobvious. My own impression is that this is\\ncurrently a significant factor. As an indica-\\ntion of the complexity of the issues, let me\\njust mention here that some recent research\\nby my colleagues Peter Diamond and Eric\\nMaskin suggests the possibility that in some\\nenvironments search activity conveys a posi-\\ntive externality. So the optimal search\\nstrategy for the individual might provide\\nless than the socially optimal amount of\\nsearch, and unemployment compensation\\ncould be regarded as a corrective subsidy.\\nThis is a neat twist on the theme of the\\ncounterpoint between market efficiency and\\nmarket failure. In any case, it can hardly be\\ndoubted that the unemployment compensa-\\ntion system is an important determinant of\\nbehavior on both sides of the labor market,\\nand complicates even the definition of full\\nemployment.\\nThe last comment of Pigou\\'s that I want\\nto cite is especially intriguing because it is so\\nunlike the sort of thing that his present day\\nsuccessors keep saying. Already in the 1933\\nTheory of Unemployment he wrote: \"... . pub-\\nlic opinion in a modem civilized State\\nbuilds up for itself a rough estimate of what\\nconstitutes a reasonable living wage. This is\\nderived half-consciously from a knowledge\\nof the actual standards enjoyed by more\\nor less \\'average\\' workers.... Public opin-\\nion then enforces its view, failing success\\nthrough social pressure, by the machinery\\nof... legislation\" (p. 255). A similar remark\\nappears in Lapses. Such feelings about eq-\\nuity and fairness are obviously relevant to\\nthe setting of statutory minimum wages, and\\nPigou uses them that way. I think they also\\ncome into play as a deterrent to wage cut-\\nting in a slack labor market. Unemployed\\nworkers rarely try to displace their em-\\nployed counterparts by offering to work for\\nless; and it is even more surprising, as I\\nhave had occasion to point out in the past,\\nthat employers so rarely try to elicit wage\\ncutting on the part of their laid-off em-\\nployees, even in a buyer\\'s market for labor.\\nSeveral forces can be at work, but I think\\nOccam\\'s razor and common observation\\nboth suggest that a code of good behavior\\nenforced by social pressure is one of them.\\nWouldn\\'t you be surprised if you learned\\nthat someone of roughly your status in the\\nprofession, but teaching in a less desirable\\ndepartment, had written to your department\\nchairman offering to teach your courses for\\nless money?

Evidently he concluded\\nthat the tendency of the capitalist economy\\nto seek (and find) its full-employment\\nequilibrium was strong enough so that de-\\npartures from full employment could be re-\\ngarded as mere episodes. Is that surprising?\\nWell, to begin with, there is no accounting\\nfor Rohrschach tests. One person\\'s ink blot\\nis another person\\'s work of art. But I think\\nthere is also something more systematic to\\nbe said.\\nIn the Theory of Unemployment, Pigou\\ngives an elaborate analysis of the short-run\\nelasticity of demand for labor. He is very\\ncareful: he allows for the elasticity of supply\\nof complementary raw materials; he allows\\nfor the (presumably very high) price elastic-\\nity of demand for exports; he discusses the\\neffects of discounting future returns to\\nlabor. It is a masterly attempt to get a grip\\non orders of magnitude. It is all based on\\nthe presumption that the only possible start-\\ning point is the elasticity of the marginal-\\nproduct-of-labor curve. Let me remind you\\nthat in the old standby, two-factor Cobb-\\nDouglas case, the elasticity of demand for\\nlabor with respect to the real wage is the\\nreciprocal of the share of capital. Every-\\nbody\\'s back-of-the-envelope puts the capital\\nshare at 1/4 and the elasticity of demand\\nfor labor at 4. This is not exactly the way\\nPigou proceeds, but he reaches the same\\nconclusion: the initial estimate of the elas-\\nticity is \"certain to be (numerically) much\\nlarger than - 1 and may well amount to - 5\\nor more.\" There follow some modifications,\\nbut the conclusion remains that in times of\\ndepression, the aggregate elasticity of de-\\nmand for labor with respect to the real wage\\n\"cannot, on the least favourable assumption\\nhere suggested, be numerically less than - 3\\nand may well be larger than -4\" except\\nperhaps in the very shortest run.\\nFor practical purposes, one would want\\nto know the elasticity of demand with re-\\nspect to the nominal wage, taking account\\nof the likelihood that prices will follow\\nwages down, at least partially. (Obviously if\\nproduct prices fall equiproportionally with\\nwage rates, as Keynes thought might\\nhappen in unlucky circumstances, the real\\nwage doesn\\'t move at all and employment\\nwill not improve.)\\' The details of Pigou\\'s\\ncalculations do not concern us, but his con-\\nclusion does: \"... we may... not unreason-\\nably put the elasticity of the money demand\\nfor labour in times of deep depression at not\\nless numerically than - 1.5.\"\\nIf I could believe that, I too could believe\\nthat the labor market generally clears.

Assessing their combined signifi-\\ncance quantitatively would be a very dif-\\nficult task, and I do not pretend to be able\\nto do that. We are all interpreting this ink\\nblot together. Obviously I would not be\\ngiving this particular talk if I did not think\\nthat wage stickiness is a first-order factor in\\na reasonable theory of unemployment.\\nTo make my position plausible, I want to\\ntry to summarize the sort of general char-\\nacteristics that the labor market should have\\nif the particular mechanisms that I have\\nenumerated are to be important. By the\\nway, I have no reason to believe that my list\\nis anything like exhaustive; you may think\\nof others. Simply to narrow the field, I have\\ndeliberately left out of account factors relat-\\ning specifically to age, sex, race, and other\\ncharacteristics that normally form the basis\\nfor discussions of structural unemployment\\nas distinct from cyclical unemployment.\\nThe sort of labor market I have in mind is\\nsegmented. It often makes sense to think of\\nan employer or definable group of em-\\nployers as facing its own labor pool. Some\\nmembers of the labor pool may be unem-\\nployed, but still belong to it. Although\\ntransportation, information, and transaction\\ncosts are possible sources of segmentation,\\nthey need not be among the most important.\\nThe buildup of firm-specific or industry-\\nspecific human capital may be more funda-\\nmental, and equally a kind of mutual know-\\ning-what-to-expect that gives both parties in\\nthe labor market a stake, a rent, in the\\ndurability of the relationship. This point is\\nclose to the distinction between auction\\nmarkets and customer markets made by\\nArthur Okun in a different context. The\\nlabor market, at least the \"primary\" labor\\nmarket, is a customer market; this may be\\none of the important facts that differentiates\\nthe primary from the secondary labor\\nmarket.\\nA second general characteristic is the\\navailability of some nontrivial source of\\nnonemployment income. The obvious one is\\nunemployment compensation, but I imagine\\nthat fringe activity ranging from hustling to\\nhome maintenance can function in much\\nthe same way. I suppose in some societies\\nthe possibility of returning temporarily to\\nfarming is now as important as it once was\\nhere. The presence of a second earner in the\\nfamily can make an obvious difference. One\\nconsequence is that it becomes easier to\\nmaintain a labor pool in the presence of\\nfluctuating employment. In addition, as I\\nmentioned a few moments ago, several of\\nthe specific sticky-wage mechanisms in my\\ncatalog depend for their operation on this\\ncharacteristic.\\nThird, the stability of the labor pool\\nmakes it possible for social conventions to\\nassume some importance. There is a dif-\\nference between a long-term relationship\\nand a one-night stand, and acceptable be-\\nhavior in one context may be unacceptable\\nin the other.

Critics who deride the notion\\nof \"economic man\" have a point, but usu-\\nally the wrong point. Economic man is a\\nsocial, not a psychological, category. There\\nare activities in our culture in which it is\\nsocially acceptable and expected that indi-\\nvidual pecuniary self-interest will be the\\noverriding decision criterion: choosing a\\nportfolio of securities, for example.6 There\\nare others in which it is not: choosing a\\nmate, for example.7 The labor market is\\nmore complicated than either, of course,\\nand contains elements of both. Perhaps in\\nnineteenth-century Manchester labor was\\nbought and sold by \"thorough-going compe-\\ntition\" but I think that is unlikely to be a\\ngood approximation to contemporary wage\\nsetting. In particular, as I have emphasized,\\nthere is nothing in the data or in common\\nobservation to make you believe that mod-\\nerate excess supply will evoke aggressive\\nwage cutting on either side of the labor\\nmarket.\\nIn\\nI draw two conclusions from this whole\\ntrain of thought, one about economics and\\nthe other about the economy.\\nAbout economics: it -need not follow\\nthat we old dogs have to learn a lot of new\\ntricks. It still seems reasonable to presume\\nthat agents do the best they can, subject to\\nwhatever constraints they perceive. But in\\nsome contexts the traditional formulations\\nof the objective function and constraints\\nmay be inappropriate. In the labor market,\\nthe participants are firms and groups of\\nfirms on one side, and individual workers,\\norganized trade unions, and informally\\norganized labor pools on the other. Grant\\nme that all feel constrained, to some nontriv-\\nial degree, by social customs that have to\\ndo with the wage and wage-setting proce-\\ndures. The result is that factor prices turn\\nup in our equations in unfamiliar ways. Let\\nme just mention a few examples from my\\nearlier list of hypotheses. If Keynes was\\nright about the conventional significance of\\nrelative wages, then ratios of wage rates\\nappear in the objective functions on the\\nlabor side. If the current or future perfor-\\nmance of workers depends on their feelings\\nthat wage levels are fair, then wage rates\\nappear in the production functions con-\\nstraining firms. If the individual worker\\'s\\nutility function depends quite convention-\\nally on current income, then the collective\\nobjective function of a labor pool of identi-\\ncal workers might reasonably be a weighted\\naverage of the utility of the wage and the\\nutility achievable when unemployed, with\\nweights equal to the employment and unem-\\nployment fractions. This objective function\\ncontains both wage and volume of employ-\\nment as arguments; and it has the inter-\\nesting property that the marginal rate of\\nsubstitution between wage rate and employ-\\nment can depend very sensitively on the size\\nof the unemployment insurance benefit.\\nConstrained maximization and partial or\\ncomplete reconciliation in the market can\\nstill be the bread and butter of the macro\\ntheorist. Spread with more palatable be-\\nhavior assumptions, they may make a tastier\\nsandwich, and stick to the ribs.\\nAbout the economy: if the labor mar-\\nket is often not in equilibrium, if wages are\\noften sticky, if they respond to nontradi-\\ntional signals, then there is a role for macro\\npolicy and a good chance that it will be\\neffective. Equilibrium theories that conclude\\nthe opposite may conceivably turn out to\\nhave the right answer, but they simply\\nassume what they purport to prove. It is not\\nmy argument that standard textbook policy\\nprescriptions are bound to be right. That\\nhas to be worked out case by case.

That con-\\nsensus, however, has now weakened. The\\neconomic role of government is again the\\nsubject of debate, attack, and resistance far\\nmore intense than we have known for de-\\ncades. The attack ranges over a wide spec-\\ntrum. It questions the scope of government,\\nthe particular measures and policies through\\nwhich government exercises its functions,\\nand the political institutions which shape\\nthe measures and policies employed. A few\\nvoices call on us to move on to a more en-\\ncompassing socialism, including the owner-\\nship of industry.

And\\nthere is much more to economic welfare\\nthan can be captured in any long-term mea-\\nsure of output: job stability; income secur-\\nity, a fair distribution of opportunities and\\nrewards.\\nThe economic role of government ex-\\npanded during the last half century and\\nmore in large part in order to pursue the\\nsocial objectives that are not comprehended\\nin measured net national product. The result\\nis the mixed economy or welfare state in\\nwhich we now live and which is now the\\nobject of attack.\\nProductivity growth is a useful focus of\\ndiscussion in relation to the current discon-\\ntents and the accompanying reappraisal of\\nour mixed economy for a combination of\\ntwo reasons.\\nTo begin with, productivity, viewed as a\\nsource of private earnings, exists in a state\\nof uneasy tension with the other welfare\\nobjectives, which we pursue largely through\\nthe government. The causes of the tension\\nneed to be underscored.\\nFirst-an obvious point-the more in-\\ncome that is diverted to social uses, the less\\nof any given aggregate remains under the\\nprivate control of income earners for their\\nown personal use.\\nNext, the size of the diversion and the\\nway it is made and used affects the level of\\noutput and productivity, present and future.\\nThat is partly because a host of government\\nactivities are supportive of current output\\nand productivity, and many activities, in-\\ncluding some, like education, that are un-\\ndertaken for generalized social objectives,\\nare in the nature of capital formation.' In a\\nstill more basic sense, moreover, and one\\nmuch neglected in current debates, the pace\\nof growth in a country depends not only on\\nits access to new technology, but on its\\nability to make and absorb the social adjust-\\nments required to exploit new products and\\nprocesses. Simply to recall the familiar, the\\nprocess includes the displacement and redis-\\ntribution of populations among regions and\\nfrom farm to city. It demands the abandon-\\nment of old industries and occupations, and\\nthe qualification of workers for new, more\\nskilled occupations. The extension of educa-\\ntion, with all its implications for shifts in\\nsocial status, in aspiration, and in political\\npower, is a requisite. Along the technologi-\\ncal path which we have followed, growth\\nalso demands very large-scale enterprise\\nwhich establishes new types of market power\\nand alters the relations of workers and em-\\nployers. Viewed from another angle, the de-\\npendent employment status of workers and\\nthe mobility of industry and people imply a\\ngreat change in the structure of families and\\nin their roles in caring for children, the sick,\\nand the old. Because the required adapta-\\ntions can and do alter the positions, pros-\\npects, and power of established groups,\\nconflict and resistance are intrinsic to the\\ngrowth process. To resolve such conflict and\\nresistance in a way which preserves a large\\nconsensus for growth, yet does not impose a\\ncost which retards growth unduly, a mecha-\\nnism of conflict resolution is needed. The\\nnational sovereign state necessarily becomes\\nthe arbiter of group conflict and the mitiga-\\ntor of those negative effects of economic\\nchange which would otherwise induce resis-\\ntance to growth.2\\nThe enlargement of the government's eco-\\nnomic role, including its support of income\\nminima, health care, social insurance, and\\nthe other elements of the welfare state, was,\\ntherefore-at least up to a point-not just a\\nquestion of compassionate regard for the\\nunfortunate, and not just a question of re-\\nducing inequalities of outcome and oppor-\\ntunity, though that is how people usually\\nthink of it.

The government\\'s roles as referee\\nand as mitigator of the costs of growth- as\\nwell as instrument for pursuing welfare goals\\nsupplementary to measured productivity-\\nmust be paid for. But it is essentially impos-\\nsible to design a tax system that places no\\nmarginal burden on the rewards for produc-\\ntive effort, or a regulatory system that has\\nno cost in measured output. Similarly, we\\ncan hardly design a transfer system which-\\nup to a point-necessarily divorces income\\nfrom work, but which yet does not qualify\\neconomic incentives.

The tension implies a dif-\\nficult and delicate problem of choice and\\nbalance. A balance-certainly a wide ac-\\nceptance of the pace and nature of our joint\\npursuit of different welfare goals- seemed\\nto exist during the first two postwar decades\\nwhen productivity growth was relatively\\nrapid.

That is\\nthe second reason why productivity growth\\nis a useful focuis for examining the current\\ndissatisfaction with our mixed economy.\\nI shall deal briefly with three matters:\\n1) What were the developments which\\nwere antecedent to (which stand in the\\nbackground of) our present troubles and its\\naccompanying discontent?\\n2) What can we now say about the\\ncauses of the current productivity retarda-\\ntion? In particular, to what extent is the\\nretardation connected with the enlarged role\\nof government and its pursuit of alternative\\nsocial goals?\\n3) What is the outlook for productivity\\ngrowth, and what are the implications of\\nthat outlook for the further development of\\nour mixed economic system?\\nII\\nIn the early part of the postwar period,\\neconomic growth, in the aggregate and per\\ncapita, established itself as a premier goal of\\neconomic policy-co-equal with \"full\" em-\\nployment, perhaps of even higher priority.\\nBesides the standard reason, that per capita\\ngrowth raises average levels of consumption,\\nthere were special reasons. Growth was seen\\nas the best way to overcome poverty without\\nthe social conflicts accompanying redistri-\\nbution. It would create a favorable environ-\\nment in which to open opportunities for\\nblacks and other minorities. It would pro-\\nvide the resources for meeting still other\\nsocial goals, for example, extended educa-\\ntion and health care. Growth was also sought\\nto maintain defense, to compete politically\\nwith a fast-growing Soviet Union and to\\nassert continued leadership in our rapidly\\nprogressing alliance. Growth would enable\\nus to help not only the poor in our own\\ncountry, it would permit us to help the still\\nmore impoverished people of the less-\\ndeveloped world. Productivity growth was a\\ngoal distinguishable from full employment,\\nbut it was also seen-not necessarily cor-\\nrectly- as a condition of full employment.\\nUnless we could hold our own in interna-\\ntional trade, our foreign accounts would im-\\npose demand restraints on policy and make\\nfor chronic underemployment.\\nThis growth, so ardently desired, was in\\nfact achieved. For two decades, income per\\ncapita grew faster than ever before and out-\\nput per hour much faster. At the same time,\\nthere was a rapid development of govern-\\nment in pursuit of other welfare objectives,\\nand this was also eagerly sought. The Social\\nSecurity system established in the 1930\\'s\\nwas enlarged; education was rapidly ex-\\ntended; science was fostered; there were\\nlarge programs for hospital building and\\nhousing.

Not\\nsurprisingly, therefore, the progress of the\\nfirst two postwar decades was followed by a\\ncertain recoil from growth-a reordering, if\\nnot reversal, of priorities.

Most analyses leave a substantial\\npart of the retardation unconnected with\\nany identified and measured contributory\\nsource, and they disagree about the time-\\nwhether after 1973 or as early as the latter\\n1960\\'s-when that unspecified residual re-\\ntardation made its appearance.\\'2\\nIn this state of factual uncertainty, it is\\nnot hard to propose estimates of the sources\\nof retardation which assign substantial re-\\nsponsibility to factors connected with the\\ngovernment\\'s welfare and regulatory activi-\\nties. We, therefore, find William Fellner ask-\\ning: \"...whether, directly or indirectly [the\\nanalyses of the retardation] do not suggest\\nthat the weakening of the productivity trend\\nis attributable in part to changes in the\\nsocio-political environment that are of re-\\ncent origin or that have cumulated to a\\n\\'critical mass\"\\' (p. 4).\\nThe suggested mode of operation of these\\nfactors is, first, through a decline in the rate\\nof capital deepening; second, through a de-\\ncline of worker effort symptomized by ab-\\nsenteeism and by a drop in hours worked\\nrelative to hours paid; third, by a disinclina-\\ntion for risky, innovatory effort, whose\\nmanifestation is the observed slowdown in\\nthe residual measures of total factor produc-\\ntivity growth; and fourth, through the diver-\\nsion of resources to regulatory compliance,\\nthe benefits of which do not register in\\nmeasured output even when they should.\\nThese sources of retardation whether great\\nor small-the \"suspects,\" as Fellner calls\\nthem-are arguably associated with char-\\nacteristic features of our mixed economy,\\neven if they are not exclusively due to them.\\nThe first of those features is the widening\\ndifference between before- and after-tax\\nmarginal rates of return to work, saving,\\ninvestment, and risk taking. The magnitude\\nof the rise in these rates is indicated by the\\noverall increase of total government ex-\\npenditures from 20 percent of GNP in\\n1947-49 to 28 percent in 1963-65 and again\\nto over 32 percent in 1977-79.13 The incen-\\ntive effects of the tax increases are still im-\\nperfectly understood, but there is little\\nreason to suppose they are not distinctly\\nunfavorable.\\'4 Allied to the effects of rising\\ntax burdens is the possible effect of the\\ncumulating \"social security wealth\" of indi-\\nviduals on savings and that of other in-\\nsurance and income-support programs on\\nwork.\\'5 Next, there are the effects of bur-\\ngeoning regulatory activity. These go be-\\nyond the direct resource costs of compliance\\nalready mentioned. There are also indirect\\ncosts and risks of obtaining administrative\\nand judicial clearance for new projects, the\\ndiversion of R&D expenditure to meet en-\\nvironmental and safety standards, and the\\nhazards of possible future changes in regula-\\ntory requirements. Finally, there are the\\nmanifold effects of erratic and accelerating\\ninflation.\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Inflation, in conjunction\\nwith tax rules and accounting practices de-\\nsigned for a stable price regime, has meant\\nvery high marginal taxes on returns to\\ncapital. In the judgement of some public\\nfinance experts, it has also meant a differen-\\ntial burden on business investment com-\\npared with that on household borrowing,\\nspending, and investing.\\'6 If there are fears\\nof accelerated inflation in the future, they\\ncarry the prospect of still higher taxes and\\nlower returns while the erratic nature of\\nrapid inflation makes the future more dif-\\nficult to discern and increases the sense of\\nrisk. And if the same fears give rise to a\\nvision of price controls, the risks of invest-\\nment and innovation are compounded. In\\nany event, inflation compels- or threatens\\nto compel-governments to reduce capacity\\nutilization below its potential. Therefore\\ninflation acts to diminish one of the induce-\\nments to invest, as the 1980 business con-\\ntraction following on financial disorder il-\\nlustrates. We should remember, moreover,\\nthat there is an element of vicious circularity\\nin this aspect of our present conjecture. In-\\nflation has deleterious effects on productiv-\\nity growth-and unexpected declines in\\nproductivity growth exacerbate inflation.\\nThis range of considerations leads some\\nstudents to the view that the pursuit of\\nalternative welfare goals accounts for a very\\nconsiderable part of the retardation. Fellner,\\nwhom I mentioned before, suggests that \"the\\ncauses of at least 1 percentage point annual\\nslackening of the trend in output per\\nworker\\'s hour can be found among the \\'sus-\\npects\"\\' (p. 10). That loss is equal to one-half\\nthe observed difference between the private-\\nsector productivity growth since 1973 and\\nthat during the quarter century between 1948\\nand 1973.\\nSuch numbers and the argument that leads\\nto them should be understood to be no more\\nthan what they are-a prima facie indica-\\ntion that something very substantial may be\\ninvolved in the choices we make between\\nproductivity growth and alternative welfare\\ngoals. I would not mention them if I did not\\nfear that there is much to the problem, if\\nnot as a cause of the recent abrupt retarda-\\ntion, then as a longer-term secular con-\\nstraint.

True, the negative im-\\npact of the recent big influx of inexperi-\\nenced young workers is due to be reversed.\\nIn looking ahead, however, more basic ques-\\ntions need to be addressed. No one, indeed,\\nought to doubt the persistence of some\\nsubstantial continuity in what Solomon\\nFabricant has identified as\\nthe basic factors underlying economic\\ngrowth in the United States: the tastes\\nand preferences of the American peo-\\nple, the economic opportunities and\\nalternatives open to them, the social\\nframework within which they live and\\nwork together, and the relations of the\\nUnited States with the rest of the\\nworld. Different assumptions would be\\ncontrary to all experience and could\\nonly lead to wild speculation. [So he\\nconcludes] The trend of national out-\\nput per worker-hour will ... continue to\\nbe upward. [p. 1]\\nI agree; but, as Fabricant also asks, how\\nfast will the trend line rise? A \"substantial\\ndegree of continuity\" is not the same as\\nironclad fixity, and much of this talk has\\nalready pointed to some change in\\nFabricant\\'s basic factors. Within the coun-\\ntry, preferences and goals have changed in\\nthe degree to which concern for income\\nsecurity, equality of opportunity, environ-\\nmental protection, and consumer and worker\\nsafety sways votes and, to some degree, per-\\nsonal behavior. Corresponding to these shifts\\nin tastes and concerns, the \"social frame-\\nwork within which we live and work to-\\ngether\" has been recast. The government\\nhas come to play a larger role in shaping the\\n\"economic opportunities and alternatives\"\\nopen to us-while imposing burdens on our\\ngrowth potential whose weight we can now\\nsuspect but cannot yet clearly assess. Partly\\nbecause of higher incomes, partly because\\nof changes in industrial and labor market\\norganization, and partly because of govern-\\nment regulation and income support, there\\nhas been a decline in market flexibility-in\\nthe responsiveness of prices and wages to\\nthe balance of supply and demand, and\\nof people\\'s own responsiveness to price\\nchanges-the implications of which Tibor\\nScitovsky sketched last year.\\nOur relations with the rest of the world\\nhave also changed in ways which I believe\\nare dominantly, but not entirely, unfavor-\\nable to U.S. growth prospects.

It remains to be seen, of\\ncourse, whether we shall prove as successful\\nat borrowing and adapting foreign technol-\\nogy as some other countries have been.\\nThe advance of other countries, however,\\nalso has a darker side for us. The develop-\\nment of many industries in which this coun-\\ntry has long been a leader is now threatened\\nby the competition of other countries. This\\nchanges the prospects for U.S. productivity\\ngrowth to our disadvantage. It is harder for\\nan industry to push forward, or even to keep\\nup with, the technological frontier when its\\nrate of expansion slows down, still harder\\nwhen it is contracting. It is an old story that,\\nin the course of aggregate productivity\\ngrowth, the rise of new, more rapidly pro-\\ngressing industries constricts the growth of\\nthe old. That is Schumpeter\\'s \"creative de-\\nstruction,\" and it helps explain why retarda-\\ntion in the growth of output and productiv-\\nity is the normal fate of individual industries\\nwithin a country, while the growth rate of\\nthe aggregate remains constant or even\\nspeeds up. The reverse, however, is not nec-\\nessarily true, nor even probably true. We\\ncannot count on new, more progressive sec-\\ntors stepping into the breach merely because\\nthe development of our old industries is\\nconstricted by foreign competition. Foreign\\nsuccess, of course, offers us cheap imports.\\nYet the experience of Britain from 1870 to\\n1913 presents this country with a worrisome\\nhistorical question mark. As Britain\\'s basic\\nindustries lost their leadership and markets\\nto the United States, Germany, and other\\ncountries after 1870, Britain\\'s labor produc-\\ntivity growth rate was halved compared with\\nprevious decades, and her average total fac-\\ntor productivity growth during the forty\\nyears after 1870 fell to zero.\\'8 The question\\nis: Can we mount a more energetic and\\nsuccessful response to the challenge of newly\\nrising foreign competitors after 1970 than\\nBritain did after 1870?19\\nThe relative decline of U. S. economic and\\npolitical power carries with it other disad-\\nvantages, and not for ourselves alone. The\\nleadership of the United States in the liber-\\nalization and stabilization of international\\neconomic relations was one of the bases for\\nrapid world-wide productivity growth in the\\npostwar years. We were able to assert that\\nleadership because superabundant economic\\nstrength permitted us to propose arrange-\\nments beneficial to ourselves but generous\\nto other countries, and because dominant\\npolitical power persuaded sometimes re-\\ncalcitrant partners to cooperate. Today, with\\nU.S. influence reduced and U.S. as well as\\nEuropean industries under pressure, the\\nworld economy is threatened by a resur-\\ngence of protectionism, in which this coun-\\ntry is itself taking part. The world-wide price\\ndiscipline, which a relatively stable U. S\\nmonetary policy imposed through the dol-\\nlar-exchange standard, has, for the time\\nbeing, been lost. And with U.S. influence\\ndiminished, effective international coopera-\\ntion in the petroleum market and in other\\naspects of relations between industrialized\\nand developing countries has been beyond\\nour reach.\\nIn these circumstances, it is just as dif-\\nficult to maintain a vision of an unbroken 3\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

In\\nour analysis, perfect contestability, then,\\nserves not primarily as a description of real-\\nity, but as a benchmark for desirable\\nindustrial organization which is far more\\nflexible and is applicable far more widely\\nthan the one that was available to us before.\\nSecond, in the standard analysis (including\\nthat of many of our fellow rebels), the prop-\\nerties of oligopoly models are heavily depen-\\ndent on the assumed expectations and reac-\\ntion patterns characterizing the firms that\\nare involved. When there is a change in the\\nassumed nature of these expectations or re-\\nactions, the implied behavior of the oligopo-\\nlistic industry may change drastically.\\nIn our analysis, in the limiting case of\\nperfect contestability, oligopolistic structure\\nand behavior are freed entirely from their\\nprevious dependence on the conjectural vari-\\nations of incumbents and, instead, these are\\ngenerally determined uniquely and, in a\\nmanner that is tractable analytically, by the\\npressures of potential competition to which\\nBain directed our attention so tellingly.\\nThird, the standard analysis leaves us with\\nthe impression that there is a rough con-\\ntinuum, in terms of desirability of industry\\nperformance, ranging from unregulated pure\\nmonopoly as the pessimal arrangement to\\nperfect competition as the ideal, with relative\\nefficiency in resource allocation increasing\\nmonotonically as the number of firms ex-\\npands.\\nI will show that, in contrast, in perfect-\\nly contestable markets behavior is sharply\\ndiscontinuous in its welfare attributes. A\\ncontestable monopoly offers us some pre-\\nsumption, but no guarantee, of behavior con-\\nsistent with a second best optimum, subject\\nto the constraint that the firm be viable\\nfinancially despite the presence of scale\\neconomies which render marginal cost pric-\\ning financially infeasible. That is, a contest-\\nable monopoly has some reason to adopt the\\nRamsey optimal price-output vector, but it\\nmay have other choices open to it. (For the\\nanalysis of contestable monopoly, see my\\narticle with Elizabeth Bailey and Willig, Pan-\\nzar and Willig\\'s article, and my book with\\nPanzar and Willig, chs. 7 and 8.)\\nBut once each product obtains a second\\nproducer, that is, once we enter the domain\\nof duopoly or oligopoly for each and every\\ngood, such choice disappears. The contest-\\nable oligopoly which achieves an equilibrium\\nthat immunizes it from the incursions of\\nentrants has only one pricing option-it must\\nset its price exactly equal to marginal cost\\nand do all of the things required for a first\\nbest optimum! In short, once we leave the\\nworld of pure or partial monopoly, any con-\\ntestable market must behave ideally in every\\nrespect. Optimality is not approached gradu-\\nally as the number of firms supplying a\\ncommodity grows. As has long been sug-\\ngested in Chicago, two firms can be enough\\nto guarantee optimality (see, for example,\\nEugene Fama and Arthur Laffer).\\nThus, the analysis extends enormously the\\ndomain in which the invisible hand holds\\nsway.

Contestability is merely a broader\\nideal, a benchmark of wider applicability\\nthan is perfect competition. To say that con-\\ntestable oligopolies behave ideally and that\\ncontestable monopolies have some incentives\\nfor doing so is not to imply that this is even\\nnearly true of all oligopolies or of unregu-\\nlated monopolies in reality.\\nSecond, while the theory extends the do-\\nmain of the invisible hand in some direc-\\ntions, it unexpectedly restricts it in others.\\nThis brings me to the penultimate contrast I\\nwish to offer here between the earlier views\\nand those that emerge from our analysis.\\nThe older theoretical analysis seems to have\\nconsidered the invisible hand to be a rather\\nweak intratemporal allocator of resources, as\\nwe have seen. The mere presence of unregu-\\nlated monopoly or oligopoly was taken to be\\nsufficient per se to imply that resources are\\nlikely to be misallocated within a given time\\nperiod. But where the market structure is such\\nas to yield a satisfactory allocation of resources\\nwithin the period, it may have seemed that it\\ncan, at least in theory, do a good job of\\nintertemporal resource allocation. In the ab-\\nsence of any externalities, persistent and\\nasymmetric information gaps, and of inter-\\nference with the workings of capital markets,\\nthe amounts that will be invested for the\\nfuture may appear to be consistent with\\nPareto optimality and efficiency in the supply\\nof outputs to current and future generations.\\nHowever, our analysis shows that where\\nthere are economies of scale in the produc-\\ntion of durable capital, intertemporal con-\\ntestable monopoly, which may perform rela-\\ntively well in the single period, cannot be\\ndepended upon to perform ideally as time\\npasses. In particular, we will see that the\\nleast costly producer is in the long run\\nvulnerable to entry or replacement by rivals\\nwhose appearance is inefficient because it\\nwastes valuable social resources.\\nThere is one last contrast between the\\nnewer analyses and the older theory which I\\nam most anxious to emphasize. In the older\\ntheory, the nature of the industry structure\\nwas not normally explained by the analysis.\\nIt was, in effect, taken to be given exoge-\\nnously, with the fates determining, ap-\\nparently capriciously, that one industry will\\nbe organized as an oligopoly, another as a\\nmonopoly and a third as a set of monopolis-\\ntic competitors. Assuming that this destiny\\nhad somehow been revealed, the older\\nanalyses proceeded to investigate the conse-\\nquences of the exogenously given industry\\nstructure for pricing, outputs, and other deci-\\nsions.2\\nThe new analyses are radically different in\\nthis respect. In our analysis, among others,\\nan industry\\'s structure is determined ex-\\nplicitly, endogenously, and simultaneously\\nwith the pricing, output, advertising, and\\nother decisions of the firms of which it is\\nconstituted. This, perhaps, is one of the prime\\ncontributions of the new theoretical analyses.\\nI. Characteristics of Contestable Markets\\nPerhaps a misplaced instinct for melo-\\ndrama has led me to say so much about\\ncontestable markets without even hinting\\nwhat makes a market contestable. But I can\\npostpone the definition no longer. A con-\\ntestable market is one into which entry is\\nabsolutely free, and exit is absolutely costless.\\nWe use \"freedom of entry\" in Stigler\\'s sense,\\nnot to mean that it is costless or easy, but\\nthat the entrant suffers no disadvantage in\\nterms of production technique or perceived\\nproduct quality relative to the incumbent,\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"and that potential entrants find it ap-\\npropriate to evaluate the profitability of en-\\ntry in terms of the incumbent firms' pre-entry\\nprices. In short, it is a requirement of con-\\ntestability that there be no cost discrimina-\\ntion against entrants. Absolute freedom of\\nexit, to us, is one way to guarantee freedom\\nof entry. By this we mean that any firm can\\nleave without impediment, and in the process\\nof departure can recoup any costs incurred\\nin the entry process. If all capital is salable\\nor reusable without loss other than that cor-\\nresponding to normal user cost and deprecia-\\ntion, then any risk of entry is eliminated.\\nThus, contestable markets may share at\\nmost one attribute with perfect competition.\\nTheir firms need not be small or numerous\\nor independent in their decision making or\\nproduce homogeneous products. In short, a\\nperfectly competitive market is necessarily\\nperfectly contestable, but not vice versa.\\nThe crucial feature of a contestable market\\nis its vulnerability to hit-and-run entry. Even\\na very transient profit opportunity need not\\nbe neglected by a potential entrant, for he\\ncan go in, and, before prices change, collect\\nhis gains and then depart without cost, should\\nthe climate grow hostile.\\nShortage of time forces me to deal rather\\nbriefly with two of the most important prop-\\nerties of contestable markets-their welfare\\nattributes and the way in which they de-\\ntermine industry structure. I deal with these\\nbriefly because an intuitive view of the logic\\nof these parts of the analysis is not difficult\\nto provide. Then I can devote a bit more\\ntime to some details of the oligopoly and the\\nintertemporal models.\\nA. Perfect Contestability and Welfare\\nThe welfare properties of contestable\\nmarkets follow almost directly from their\\ndefinition and their vulnerability to hit-and-\\nrun incursions. Let me list some of these\\nproperties and discuss them succinctly.\\nFirst, a contestable market never offers\\nmore than a normal rate of profit-its eco-\\nnomic profits must be zero or negative, even\\nif it is oligopolistic or monopolistic. The\\nreason is simple. Any positive profit means\\nthat a transient entrant can set up business,\\nreplicate a profit-making incumbent's output\\nat the same cost as his, undercut the in-\\ncumbent's prices slightly and still earn a\\nprofit. That is, continuity and the opportun-\\nity for costless entry and exit guarantee that\\nan entrant who is content to accept a slightly\\nlower economic profit can do so by selecting\\nprices a bit lower than the incumbent's.\\nIn sum, in a perfectly contestable market\\nany economic profit earned by an incumbent\\nautomatically constitutes an earnings oppor-\\ntunity for an entrant who will hit and, if\\nnecessary, run (counting his temporary but\\nsupernormal profits on the way to the bank).\\nConsequently, in contestable markets, zero\\nprofits must characterize any equilibrium,\\neven under monopoly and oligopoly.\\nThe second welfare characteristic of a con-\\ntestable market follows from the same argu-\\nment as the first. This second attribute of\\nany contestable market is the absence of any\\nsort of inefficiency in production in industry\\nequilibrium. This is true alike of inefficiency\\nof allocation of inputs, X-inefficiency, ineffi-\\ncient operation of the firm, or inefficient\\norganization of the industry. For any unnec-\\nessary cost, like any abnormal profit, con-\\nstitutes an invitation to entry. Of course, in\\nthe short run, as is true under perfect compe-\\ntition, both profits and waste may be pres-\\nent. But in the long run, these simply cannot\\nwithstand the threat brandished by potential\\nentrants who have nothing to lose by grab-\\nbing at any opportunity for profit, however\\ntransient it may be.\\nA third welfare attribute of any long-run\\nequilibrium in a contestable market is that\\nno product can be sold at a price, p, that is\\nless than its marginal cost. For if some firm\\nsells y units of output at such a price and\\nmakes a profit in the process, then it is\\npossible for an entrant to offer to sell a\\nslightly smaller quantity, y - E, at a price a\\nshade lower than the incumbent's, and still\\nmake a profit. That is, if the price p is less\\nthan MC, then the sale of y - E units at price\\np must yield a total profit X + A7r which is\\ngreater than the profit, va, that can be earned\\nby selling only y units of output at that price.\\nTherefore, there must exist a price just\\nslightly lower than p which enables the en-\\ntrant to undercut the incumbent and yet to\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",
       " 'conomics-1982-0-07.tx',\n",
       " 'earn at least as much as the incumbent, by\\neliminating the unprofitable marginal unit.\\nThis last attribute of contestable equilibria\\n-the fact that price must always at least\\nequal marginal cost-is important for the\\neconomics of antitrust and regulation. For it\\nmeans that in a perfectly contestable market,\\nno cross subsidy is possible, that is, no\\npredatory pricing can be used as a weapon of\\nunfair competition. But we will see it also\\nhas implications which are more profound\\ntheoretically and which are more germarte to\\nour purposes. For it constitutes half of the\\nargument which shows that when there are\\ntwo or more suppliers of any product, its\\nprice must, in equilibrium, be exactly equal\\nto marginal cost, and so resource allocation\\nmust satisfy all the requirements of first best\\noptimality.\\nIndeed, the argument here is similar to the\\none which has just been described. But there\\nis a complication which is what introduces\\nthe two-firm requirement into this proposi-\\ntion. p < MC constitutes an opportunity for\\nprofit to an entrant who drops the unprofit-\\nable marginal unit of output, as we have just\\nseen. It would seem, symmetrically, that p >\\nMC also automatically constitutes an op-\\nportunity for profitable entry. Instead of sell-\\ning the y-unit output of a profitable in-\\ncumbent, the entrant can now offer to sell\\nthe slightly larger output, y + e, using the\\nprofits generated by the marginal unit at a\\nprice greater than marginal cost to permit a\\nreduction in price below the incumbent\\'s.\\nBut on this side of the incumbent\\'s output,\\nthere is a catch in the argument. Suppose the\\nincumbent is a monopolist. Then output and\\nprice are constrained by the elasticity of\\ndemand. An attempt by an entrant to sell\\ny + e rather than y may conceivably cause a\\nsharp reduction in price which eliminates the\\napparent profits of entry. In the extreme case\\nwhere demand is perfectly inelastic, there\\nwill be no positive price at which the market\\nwill absorb the quantity y +? . This means\\nthat the profit opportunity represented by\\np > MC can crumble into dust as soon as\\nanyone seeks to take advantage of it.\\nBut all this changes when the market con-\\ntains two or more sellers. Now p > MC does\\nalways constitute a real opportunity for prof-\\nitable entry. The entrant who wishes to sell a\\nbit more than some one of the profitable\\nincumbents, call him incumbent A, need not\\npress against the industry\\'s total demand\\ncurve for the product. Rather, he can under-\\ncut A, steal away all of his customers, at least\\ntemporarily, and, in addition, steal away e\\nunits of demand from any other incumbent,\\nB. Thus, if A and B together sell Ya + Yb > Ya\\'\\nthen an entrant can lure away Ya + -> Ya\\ncustomers, for - sufficiently small, and earn\\non this the incremental profit e( p - MC)>O.\\nThis means that the entrant who sells Ya + e\\ncan afford to undercut the prevailing prices\\nsomewhat and still make more profit than an\\nincumbent who sells Ya at price p.\\nIn sum, where a product is sold by two or\\nmore firms, any p > MC constitutes an irre-\\nsistible entry opportunity for hit-and-run en-\\ntry in a perfectly contestable market, for it\\npromises the entrant supernormal profits\\neven if they accrue for a very short period of\\ntime.\\nConsequently, when a perfectly contest-\\nable market contains two or more sellers,\\nneither p < MC nor p > MC is compatible\\nwith equilibrium. Thus we have our third\\nand perhaps most crucial welfare attribute of\\nsuch perfectly contestable markets- their\\nprices, in equilibrium, must be equal to\\nmarginal costs, as is required for Pareto opti-\\nmality of the \"first best\" variety. This, along\\nwith the conclusion that such markets permit\\nno economic profits and no inefficiency in\\nlong-run equilibrium, constitutes their criti-\\ncal properties from the viewpoint of eco-\\nnomic welfare. Certainly, since they do enjoy\\nthose three properties, the optimality of per-\\nfectly contestable equilibria (with the res-\\nervations already expressed about the case of\\npure monopoly) fully justifies our conclusion\\nthat perfect contestability constitutes a\\nproper generalization of the concept of per-\\nfect competition so far as welfare impli-\\ncations are concerned.\\nB.

       " \"analysis. Though this area encompasses one\\nof its most crucial accomplishments, there is\\nno way I can do justice to the details of the\\nanalysis in an oral presentation and within\\nmy allotted span of time. However, an intui-\\ntive view of the matter is not difficult.\\nThe key to the analysis lies in the second\\nwelfare property of contestable equilibria-\\ntheir incompatibility with inefficiency of any\\nsort. In particular, they are incompatible with\\ninefficiency in the organization of an in-\\ndustry. That is, suppose we consider whether\\na particular output quantity of an industry\\nwill be produced by two firms or by a thou-\\nsand. Suppose it turns out that the two-firm\\narrangement can produce the given output at\\na cost 20 percent lower than it can be done\\nby the 1,000 firms. Then one implication of\\nour analysis is that the industry cannot be in\\nlong-run equilibrium if it encompasses 1,000\\nproducers. Thus we already have some hint\\nabout the equilibrium industry structure of a\\ncontestable market.\\nWe can go further with this example. Sup-\\npose that, with the given output vector for\\nthe industry, it turns out that no number of\\nfirms other than two can produce at as low a\\ntotal cost as is possible under a two-firm\\narrangement. That is, suppose two firms can\\nproduce the output vector at a total cost\\nlower than it can be done by one firm or\\nthree firms or sixty or six thousand. Then we\\nsay that for the given output vector the in-\\ndustry is a natural duopoly.\\nThis now tells us how the industry's struc-\\nture can be determined. We proceed, concep-\\ntually, in two steps. First we determine what\\nstructure happens to be most efficient for the\\nproduction of a given output vector by a\\ngiven industry. Next, we investigate when\\nmarket pressures will lead the industry to-\\nward such an efficient structure in equi-\\nlibrium.\\nNow, the first step, though it has many\\nintriguing analytic attributes, is essentially a\\npure matter of computation. Given the cost\\nfunction for a typical firm, it is ultimately a\\nmatter of calculation to determine how many\\nfirms will produce a given output most effi-\\nciently. For example, if economies of scale\\nhold throughout the relevant range and there\\nare sufficient complementarities in the pro-\\nduction of the different commodities sup-\\nplied by the firm, then it is an old and\\nwell-known conclusion that single firm pro-\\nduction will be most economical-that we\\nare dealing with a natural monopoly.\\nSimilarly, in the single product case sup-\\npose the average cost curve is U shaped and\\nattains its minimum point at an output of\\n10,000 units per year. Then it is obvious that\\nif the industry happens to sell 50,000 units\\nper year, this output can be produced most\\ncheaply if it is composed of exactly five\\nfirms, each producing 10,000 units at its\\npoint of minimum average cost.\\nThings become far more complex and more\\ninteresting when the firm and the industry\\nproduce a multiplicity of commodities, as\\nthey always do in reality. But the logic is\\nalways the same. When the industry output\\nvector is small compared to the output vec-\\ntors the firm can produce at relatively low\\ncost, then the efficient industry structure will\\nbe characterized by very few firms. The op-\\nposite will be true when the industry's output\\nvector is relatively far from the origin. In the\\nmultiproduct case, since average cost cannot\\nbe defined, two complications beset the char-\\nacterization of the output vectors which the\\nfirm can produce relatively efficiently. First,\\nsince here average cost cannot be defined, we\\ncannot simply look for the point of mini-\\nmum average costs. But we overcome this\\nproblem by dealing with output bundles hav-\\ning fixed proportions among commodity\\nquantities-by moving along a ray in output\\nspace. Along any such ray the behavior of\\naverage cost is definable, and the point of\\nminimum ray average cost (RA C) is our\\ncriterion of relatively efficient scale for the\\nfirm. Thus, in Figure 1 we have a ray average\\ncost curve for the production of boots and\\nshoes when they are produced in the propor-\\ntion given by ray OR. We see that for such\\nbundles ytm is the point of minimum RA C. A\\nsecond problem affecting the determination\\nof the output vectors the firm can produce\\nefficiently is the choice of output proportions\\n-the location of the ray along which the\\nfirm will operate. This depends on the degree\\nof complementarity in production of the\\ngoods, and it also lends itself to formal anal-\\nysis.\\nWe note also that the most efficient num-\\nber of firms will vary with the location of the\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

The industry may\\nbe a natural monopoly with one output vec-\\ntor, a natural duopoly with another, and\\nefficiency may require seventy-three firms\\nwhen some third output vector is provided\\nby the industry.\\nThis, then, completes the first of the two\\nbasic steps in the endogenous determination\\nof industry structure. Here we have ex-\\namined what industry structure is least costly\\nfor each given output vector of a given in-\\ndustry, and have found how the result de-\\npends on the magnitudes of the elements of\\nthat output vector and the shape of the cost\\nfunction of the typical firm. So far the dis-\\ncussion may perhaps be considered norma-\\ntive rather than behavioral. It tells us what\\nstructure is most efficient under the circum-\\nstances, not which industry structure will\\nemerge under the pressures of the market\\nmechanism.\\nThe transition toward the second, behav-\\nioral, stage of the analysis is provided by the\\nobservation that the optimal structure of an\\nindustry depends on its output vector, while\\nthat output vector in turn depends on the\\nprices charged by its firms. But, since pricing\\ndepends on industry structure, we are\\nbrought full circle to the conclusion that\\npricing behavior and industry structure must,\\nultimately, be determined simultaneously and\\nendogenously.\\nWe are in no position to go much further\\nthan this for a market whose properties are\\nunspecified. But, for a perfectly contestable\\nmarket, we can go much further. Indeed, the\\nproperties of perfect contestability cut\\nthrough every difficulty and tell us the equi-\\nlibrium prices, outputs, and industry struc-\\nture, all at once.\\nWhere more than one firm supplies a\\nproduct, we have already characterized these\\nprices precisely. For we have concluded that\\neach equilibrium price will equal the associ-\\nated marginal cost. Then, given the industry's\\ncost and demand relationships, this yields\\nthe industry's output quantities simulta-\\nneously with its prices, in the usual manner.\\nHere there is absolutely nothing new in the\\nanalysis.\\nBut what is new is the format of the\\nanalysis of the determination of industry\\nstructure. As I have already pointed out,\\nstructure is determined by the efficiency re-\\nquirement of equilibrium in any contestable\\nmarket. Since no such equilibrium is compat-\\nible with failure to minimize industry costs,\\nit follows that the market forces under per-\\nfect contestability will bring us results con-\\nsistent with those of our normative analysis.\\nWhatever industry structures minimize total\\ncosts for the equilibrium output vector must\\nturn out to be the only structures consistent\\nwith industry equilibrium in the long run.\\nThus, for contestable markets, but for con-\\ntestable markets only, the second stage of the\\nanalysis of industry structure turns out to be\\na sham. Whatever industry structure was\\nshown by the first, normative, portion of the\\nanalysis to be least costly must also emerge\\nas the industry structure selected by market\\nbehavior. No additional calculations are re-\\nquired by the behavioral analysis. It will all\\nhave been done in the normative cost-\\nminimization analysis and the behavioral\\nanalysis is pure bonus.\\nThus, as I promised, I have indicated how\\ncontestability theory departs from the older\\ntheory which implicitly took industry struc-\\nture to be determined exogenously in a\\nmanner totally unspecified and, instead,\\nalong with other recent writings, embraces\\nthe determination of industry structure as an\\nintegral part of the theory to be dealt with\\nsimultaneously with the determination of\\nprices and outputs.\\nAt this point I can only conjecture about\\nthe determination of industry structure once\\nwe leave the limiting case of perfect contest-\\nability. But my guess is that there are no\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

If this is not\\nso it is difficult to account for the similarities\\nin the patterns of industry structure that one\\nobserves in different countries. Why else do\\nwe not see agriculture organized as an\\noligopoly in any free market economy, or\\nautomobiles produced by 10,000 firms?\\nMarket pressures must surely make any very\\ninefficient market structure vulnerable to en-\\ntry, to displacement of incumbents by for-\\neign competition, or to undermining in other\\nways. If that is so, the market structure that\\nis called for by contestability theory may not\\nprove to be too bad an approximation to\\nwhat we encounter in reality.\\nII. On Oligopoly Equilibrium\\nI should like now to examine oligopoly\\nequilibrium somewhat more extensively. We\\nhave seen that, except where a multiproduct\\noligopoly firm happens to sell some of its\\nproducts in markets in which it has no com-\\npetitors, an important partial monopoly case\\nwhich I will ignore in what follows, all prices\\nmust equal the corresponding marginal costs\\nin long-run equilibrium. But in an oligopoly\\nmarket, this is a troublesome concept. Unless\\nthe industry output vector happens to fall at\\na point where the cost function is char-\\nacterized by locally constant returns to scale,\\nwe know that zero profits are incompatible\\nwith marginal cost pricing. Particularly if\\nthere are scale economies at that point, so\\nthat marginal cost pricing precludes financial\\nviability, we can hardly expect such a solu-\\ntion to constitute an equilibrium. Besides, we\\nhave seen that long-run equilibrium requires\\nprofit to be precisely zero. We would thus\\nappear to have run into a major snag by\\nconcluding that perfect contestability always\\nleads to marginal cost pricing under oligop-\\noly.\\nThis is particularly so if the (ray) average\\ncurve is U shaped, with its minimum occur-\\nring at a single point, y n. For in this case\\nthat minimum point is the only output of the\\nfirm consistent with constant returns to scale\\nand with zero profits under marginal cost\\npricing. Thus, dealing with the single product\\ncase to make the point, it would appear, say,\\nthat if the A C-minimizing output is 1,000, in\\na contestable market, equilibrium is possible\\nif quantity demanded from the industry hap-\\npens to be exactly 2,000 units (so two firms\\ncan produce 1,000 units each) or exactly\\n3,000 units or exactly 4,000 units, etc. But\\nsuppose the demand curve happens to inter-\\nsect the industry AC curve, say, at 4,030\\nunits. That is, then, the only industry output\\nsatisfying the equilibrium requirement that\\nprice equals zero profit. But then, at least\\none of the four or five firms in the industry\\nmust produce either more or less than 1,000\\nunits of output, and so the slope of its AC\\ncurve will not be zero at that point, preclud-\\ning either MC pricing or zero profits and,\\nconsequently, violating one or the other of\\nthe requirements of equilibrium in a per-\\nfectly contestable market.\\nIt would appear that equilibrium will be\\nimpossible in this perfectly contestable\\nmarket unless by a great piece of luck the\\nindustry demand curve happens to intersect\\nits AC curve at 2,000 or 3,000 units or some\\nother integer multiple of 1,000 units of out-\\nput.\\nThere are a variety of ways in which one\\ncan grapple with this difficulty. In his disser-\\ntation at New York University, Thijs ten\\nRaa has explored the issue with some care\\nand has shown that the presence of entry\\ncosts of sufficient magnitude, that is, irre-\\nversible costs which must be borne by an\\nentrant but not by an incumbent, can\\neliminate the existence problem. The mini-\\nmum size of the entry cost required to permit\\nan equilibrium will depend on the size of the\\ndeviation from zero profits under marginal\\ncost pricing and ten Raa has given us rules\\nfor its determination. He has shown also that\\nthe existence problem, as measured by the\\nrequired minimum size of entry cost,\\ndecreases rapidly as the equilibrium number\\nof firms of the industry increases, typically\\nattaining negligible proportions as that num-\\nber reaches, say, ten enterprises. For, as is\\nwell known, when the firm's average cost\\ncurve is U shaped the industry's average cost\\ncurve will approach a horizontal line as the\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

       " \"\\nsize of industry output increases. This is\\nshown in Figure 2 which is a standard dia-\\ngram giving the firm's and the industry's AC\\ncurves when the former is U shaped. As a\\nresult, the deviations between average cost\\nand marginal cost will decline as industry\\noutput increases and so the minimum size of\\nthe entry cost required to preserve equi-\\nlibrium declines correspondingly.\\nHowever, here I want to describe another\\napproach offered in our book to the problem\\nof existence which I have just described- the\\ndifficulty of satisfying simultaneously the\\nzero-profit requirement and the requirement\\nof marginal cost pricing. This second avenue\\nrelies on the apparently unanimous conclu-\\nsion of empirical investigators of the cost\\nfunction of the firm, that AC curves are not,\\nin fact, characterized by a unique minimum\\npoint as they would be if they had a smooth\\nU shape. Rather, these investigators tell us,\\nthe A C curve of reality has a flat bottom -an\\ninterval along which it is horizontal. That is,\\naverage costs do tend to fall at first with size\\nof output, then they reach a minimum and\\ncontinue at that level for some range of\\noutputs, after which they may begin to rise\\nonce more. An A C curve of this variety is\\nshown in Figure 3. Obviously, such a flat\\nsegment of the A C curves does help matters\\nbecause there is now a range of outputs over\\nwhich MC pricing yields zero profits. More-\\nover, the longer the flat-bottomed segment\\nthe better matters are for existence of equi-\\nlibrium. Indeed, it is easy to show that if the\\nleft-hand end of the flat segment occurs at\\noutput y' and the right-hand end occurs at\\nkym, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 the\\nexistence problem disappears altogether, be-\\ncause the industry's AC curves will be hori-\\nzontal for any output greater than Ym, That\\nis, in any contestable market in which two or\\nmore firms operate the industry AC curve\\nwill be horizontal and MC pricing will al-\\nways yield zero profits. To confirm that this\\nis so, note that if, for example, the flat\\nsegment for the firm extends from y = 1,000\\nto y 2,000, then any industry output of,\\nsay, 9,000 + Ay where 0< A y < 9,000 can be\\nproduced by nine firms, each of them turn-\\ning out more than 1,000 but less than 2,000\\nunits. Hence, each of them will operate along\\nthe horizontal portion of its AC curve, as\\nequilibrium requires.\\nThus, if the horizontal interval (yi, kym)\\nhappens to satisfy k , 2, there is no longer\\nany problem for existence of equilibrium in a\\ncontestable market with two or more firms.\\nBut fate may not always be so kind. What if\\nthat horizontal interval is quite short, that is,\\nk is quite close to unity? Such a case is\\nshown in our diagram where for illustration I\\nhave taken k =4/3.\\nI should like to take advantage of your\\npatience by dealing here not with the sim-\\nplest case-that of the single product in-\\ndustry-but with the multiproduct problem.\\nI do this partly to offer you some feeling of\\nthe way in which the multiproduct analysis,\\nwhich is one of the hallmarks of our study,\\nworks out in practice.\\nBecause, as we have seen, there is no way\\none can measure average cost for all output\\ncombinations in the multiproduct case, I will\\ndeal exclusively with the total cost function.\\nFigure 4 shows such a total cost function for\\nthe single firm, which is taken to manufac-\\nture two products, boots and shoes.\\nLet us pause briefly to examine its shape.\\nAlong any ray such as OR, which keeps\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

With one\\nexception, which I will note soon, I have\\ndrawn it to have the usual sort of shape, with\\nmarginal costs falling near the origin and\\nrising at points much further from the origin.\\nOn the other hand, the trans ray cut above\\nAB yields a cross section C'TC which is more\\nor less U shaped. This means that it is rela-\\ntively cheaper to produce boots and shoes\\ntogether (point U) than to produce them in\\nisolation (point A or point B). That is, this\\nconvex trans ray shape is enough to offer us\\nthe complementarity which leads firms and\\nindustries to turn out a multiplicity of prod-\\nucts rather than specializing in the produc-\\ntion of a single good.\\nNow what, in such a case, corresponds to\\nthe flat bottom of an AC curve in a single\\nproduct case? The answer is that the cost\\nfunction in the neighborhood of the corre-\\nsponding output must be linearly homoge-\\nneous. In Figure 5 such a region, a/3yS, is\\ndepicted. It is linearly homogeneous because\\nit is generated by a set of rays such as L, M,\\nand N. For simplicity in the discussion that\\nfollows, I have given this region a very regu-\\nlar shape-it is, approximately, a rectangle\\nwhich has been moved into three-dimensional\\nspace and given a U-shaped cross section.\\nNow Figure 6 combines the two preceding\\ndiagrams and we see that they have been\\ndrawn to mesh together, so that the linearly\\nhomogeneous region constitutes a portion of\\nthe firm's total cost surface. We see then that\\nthe firm's total cost does have a region in\\nwhich constant returns to scale occur, and\\nwhich corresponds to the flat-bottomed seg-\\nment of the A C curve.\\nMoreover, as before, I have deliberately\\nkept this segment quite narrow. Indeed, I\\nhave repeated the previous proportions, let-\\nting the segment extend from a distance ym\\nfrom the origin to the distance I 4ym along\\nany ray on the floor of the diagram.\\nLet us now see what happens in these\\ncircumstances when we turn to the total cost\\nsurface for the industry. This is depicted in\\nFigure 7 which shows a relationship that\\nmay at first seem surprising. In Figure 7 I\\ndepict only the linearly homogeneous por-\\ntions of the industry's cost surface. There we\\nsee that while for the firm linear homogene-\\nity prevailed only in the interval from y' to\\n13 Imy in the case of industry output linear\\nhomogeneity also holds in that same interval\\nbut, in addition, it holds for the interval 2ym\\nto 22 , and in the region extending from\\n3ym to infinity.

For it means that even a relatively\\nsmall region of flatness in the A C curve of\\nthe individual firm, that is, of linear homo-\\ngeneity in its total cost function, eliminates\\nthe bulk of the existence problem for oligop-\\noly equilibrium in a contestable market.

The\\nproblem also does not arise for any industry\\noutput greater than 3ym in this case, because\\neverywhere beyond that marginal cost pric-\\ning yields zero profits. There are two rela-\\ntively narrow regions in which no equi-\\nlibrium is, indeed, possible, but here we may\\nconjecture that the vicissitudes of disequi-\\nlibrium will cause shifts in the demand rela-\\ntionships as changing prices and changing\\nconsumption patterns affect tastes, and so\\nthe industry will ultimately happen upon an\\nequilibrium position and remain there until\\nexogenous disturbances move it away.

Intertemporal Vulnerability to\\nInefficient Entry\\nHaving so far directed attention to areas\\nin which the invisible hand manifests unex-\\npected strength, I should like to end my\\nstory by dealing with an issue in relation to\\nwhich it is weaker than some of us might\\nhave expected. As I indicated before, this is\\nthe issue of intertemporal production involv-\\ning durable capital goods.\\nThe analysis is far more general than the\\nfollowing story suggests, but even the case I\\ndescribe is sufficiently general to make the\\npoint. We deal with an industry in which a\\nproduct is offered by a single firm that pro-\\nvides it period after period. The equilibrium\\nquantity of the commodity that is demanded\\ngrows steadily with the passage of time in a\\nmanner that is foreseen without uncertainty.\\nBecause of economies of scale in the produc-\\ntion of capacity the firm deliberately builds\\nsome excess capacity to take care of antic-\\nipated growth in sales volume. But there is\\nsome point, let us say, z =45 years in the\\nfuture, such that it would be uneconomic to\\ntake further growth in sales volume into\\naccount in the initial choice of capacity. This\\nis so because the opportunity (interest) cost\\nof the capacity that remains idle for 45 or\\nmore years exceeds the savings made possi-\\nble by the economies of scale of construc-\\ntion. Thus, after 45 years it will pay the firm\\nto undertake a second construction project\\nto build the added capacity needed to pro-\\nduce the goods demanded of it.\\nSuppose that in every particular period\\nour producer is a natural monopolist, that is,\\nhe produces the industry's supply of its one\\ncommodity at a cost lower than it can be\\ndone by any two or more enterprises. Then\\nconsidering that same product in different\\nperiods to be formally equivalent to different\\ngoods we may take our supplier to be an\\nintertemporal natural monopolist in a multi-\\nproduct industry.

That is, whatever his price vector,\\nhis market will at some time be vulnerable to\\npartial or complete takeover by an entrant\\nwho has neither superior skills nor techno-\\nlogical superiority and whose entrance\\nincreases the quantities of resources used up\\nin production. In other words, here the\\ninvisible hand proves incapable of protecting\\nthe most efficient producing arrangement and\\nleaves the incumbent producer vulnerable to\\ndisplacement by an aggressive entrant. I leave\\nto your imaginations what, if anything, this\\nsays about the successive displacements\\non the world market of the Dutch by the\\nEnglish, the English by the Germans and the\\nAmericans, and the Americans, perhaps, by\\nthe Japanese.\\nThe proof of our proposition on the inter-\\ntemporal vulnerability of incumbents to en-\\ntry that is premature from the viewpoint of\\ncost minimization does require just a little\\nbit of algebra. To keep our analysis simple, I\\nwill divide time into two periods, each last-\\ning z =45 years so that capacity in the first\\nperiod is, optimally, just sufficient to satisfy\\nall demand, but in the second, it requires the\\nconstruction of added capacity to meet de-\\nmand growth because, by assumption, antic-\\nipatory construction to meet growth more\\nthan z years in the future simply is too\\ncostly. Also for simplicity, I will assume that\\nthere are no costs other than cost of con-\\nstruction. Of course, neither this nor the use\\nof only two periods really affects the argu-\\nment in any way. My only three substantive\\nassumptions are that demand is growing with\\ntime, that there are economies of scale, that\\nis, declining average costs in construction,\\nand that there exists some length of time, z,\\nso great that it does not pay in the initial\\nconstruction to build capacity sufficient for\\nthe growth in quantity demanded that will\\noccur beyond that date.\\nThe argument, like the notation, is now\\nstraightforward. Let y, be output in period t,  P, be price in period t, and K(y) be the cost\\nof construction of capacity sufficient to pro-\\nduce (a maximum of) y units per period.\\nHere, both p, and K(y) are expressed in\\ndiscounted present value.4\\nThen, by assumption, our firm will con-\\nstruct at the beginning of the first period\\ncapacity just sufficient to produce output y,\\nat cost K(y,) and at the beginning of the\\nsecond period it will produce the rest of the\\ncapacity it needs, Y2- yI >0, at the cost\\nK(y2 - y ).\\nThe first requirement for the prices in\\nquestion to be consistent with equilibrium is\\nthat they permit the incumbent to cover his\\ncosts, that is, that\\n(1) PIYI+P2Y2 2 K(y1)+K(y2-y1).\\nSecond, for these prices to constitute an\\nequilibrium they must protect the incumbent\\nagainst any and all possible incursions by\\nentrants. That is, suppose an entrant were to\\nconsider the possibility of constructing\\ncapacity y, and not expanding in the future,\\nand, by undercutting the incumbent, selling\\nthe same output, y,, in each period. Entry on\\nthese terms will in fact be profitable unless\\nthe prices are such that the sale of y, in each\\nperiod does not bring in revenues sufficient\\nto cover the cost, K(y,), of the entrant's\\nonce-and-for-all construction. That is, entry\\nwill be profitable unless\\n(2) plyl + P2Y1 - K(y1).\\nThus, the prices in question cannot con-\\nstitute an equilibrium unless (2) as well as (1)\\nare satisfied.\\nNow, subtracting (2) from (1) we obtain\\nimmediately\\nP2(Y2-y) K(y2- yi)\\nor\\n(3) p2 > K(Y2-Y1Y)/(AY2-Yj),\\n\\n###\",\n",

Concluding Comments\\nBefore closing let me add a word on policy\\nimplications, whose details must also be left\\nto another place. In spirit, the policy conclu-\\nsions are consistent with many of those\\neconomists have long been espousing. At\\nleast in the intratemporal analysis, the heroes\\nare the (unidentified) potential entrants who\\nexercise discipline over the incumbent, and\\nwho do so most effectively when entry is\\nfree. In the limit, when entry and exit are\\ncompletely free, efficient incumbent monop-\\nolists and oligopolists may in fact be able to\\nprevent entry. But they can do so only by\\nbehaving virtuously, that is, by offering to\\nconsumers the benefits which competition\\nwould otherwise bring. For every deviation\\nfrom good behavior instantly makes them\\nvulnerable to hit-and-run entry.\\nThis immediately offers what may be a\\nnew insight on antitrust policy. It tells us\\nthat a history of absence of entry in an\\nindustry and a high concentration index may\\nbe signs of virtue, not of vice. This will be\\ntrue when entry costs in our sense are negli-\\ngible. And, then, efforts to change market\\nstructure must be regarded as mischievous\\nand antisocial in their effects.\\nA second and more obvious conclusion is\\nthe questionable desirability of artificial\\nimpediments to entry, such as regulators were\\nlong inclined to impose. The new analysis\\nmerely reinforces the view that any proposed\\nregulatory barrier to entry must start off\\nwith a heavy presumption against its adop-\\ntion. Perhaps a bit newer is the emphasis on\\nthe importance of freedom of exit which is as\\ncrucial a requirement of contestability as is\\nfreedom of entry. Thus we must reject as\\nperverse the propensity of regulators to resist\\nthe closing down of unprofitable lines of\\nactivity. This has even gone so far as a\\nCongressional proposal (apparently sup-\\nported by Ralph Nader) to require any plant\\nwith yearly sales exceeding $250,000 to pro-\\nvide fifty-two weeks of severance pay and to\\npay three years of taxes, before it will be\\npermitted to close, and that only after giving\\ntwo years notice!\\nThere is much more to the policy implica-\\ntions of the new theory, but I will stop here,\\nalso leaving its results relating to empirical\\nresearch for discussion elsewhere.\\nLet me only say in closing that I hope I\\nhave adequately justified my characterization\\nof the new theory as a rebellion or an upris-\\ning. I believe it offers a host of new analy-\\ntical methods, new tasks for empirical\\nresearch, and new results.

Thus, like almost ev-\\neryone else, I began professional life as a\\nprice-theorist. The principal alternative was\\nto become an institutionalist; and that didn\\'t\\nparticularly attract me. Only later, and some-\\nwhat by accident, did I become a macro-\\neconomist.\\nEver since the emergence of macroeco-\\nnomics as a distinct and (almost) respectable\\nbranch of analysis, there has been a con-\\nscious tension between macroeconomics and\\nmicroeconomics; much of this tension relates\\nto the roles and the behavior of prices and of\\nthe price level. Surely, it cannot be said that\\nmacroeconomics ignores prices and price\\nchanges, as is sometimes suggested. Milton\\nFriedman and his monetarist associates and\\nfollowers-who are macroeconomists of the\\nfirst water-surely do not ignore prices. And\\nthe patron saint of my kind of macroeconom-\\nics, John Maynard Keynes, also certainly\\npaid a great deal of attention to both relative\\nprices and the price level. My concern with\\nprices here, however, is not with inflation,\\nbut rather with the price-theoretical founda-\\ntions of macroeconomics. Essentially, I will\\nbe discussing some of the roles that micro-\\neconomists and macroeconomists see for\\nprices, and particularly for price changes.\\nPrice theory has moved a long way since I\\ndeserted it, and I no longer claim any exper-\\ntise in this area. But I have the impression\\nthat many current problems both in micro-\\nand macroeconomics tend to be the same\\nproblems-looked at from opposite sides of\\nthe borderline between them. Thus I propose\\nto lead us on a stroll along some sectors of\\nthat border, moving back and forth across it\\nfrom time to time, for there is no fence. And\\nI intend only a meander, not a mapping. The\\nspirit in which the journey is undertaken is\\nthat this is really all one country, and strollers\\nshould be welcome.\\nBut it is not an imaginary country that I\\npropose we visit. We will see no Walrasian\\nauctioneers, although we will see many\\nmarkets that seem to work pretty well without\\nthem. On the other hand, we will see very\\nfew wage rates being frequently revised; and\\nmany prices will look as though they were\\nbeing revised only to maintain fairly stable\\nmarkups over unit costs. In general, we will\\nobserve that the population of this country is\\nneither very much brighter-nor much more\\nstupid-than you and I are, in our own\\neconomic decisions.\\nSome aspects of the problems that I will\\ndiscuss are particularly important in an age\\nof inflation, and to the theory of inflation.\\nBut I prefer to conduct most of my discus-\\nsion without explicit reference to changes in\\nthe general price level. For almost all of the\\nmatters that I will discuss primarily involve\\nrelative prices; and it is simpler to deal with\\nthem on the assumption of a constant price\\nlevel. That way, I do not need to keep repeat-\\ning \"real price.\"\\nI start with the prices and inventories of\\nstandardized commodities.\\nI.

Any\\nmarket-participant\\'s demand for additions to\\ninventory clearly should be based upon an\\nexpectation that the price will increase suffi-\\nciently over some future period, at least to\\ncover costs of storage plus interest for that\\nperiod. Any market-participant\\'s willingness\\nto supply goods from inventory should be\\nbased on an expectation that the price will\\nrise insufficiently over any future period to\\ncover costs of storage and interest for that\\nperiod. Since expectations of future prices\\nare never certain, the expected prices de-\\nscribed should include discounts to reflect\\nrisk aversion, or premiums to reflect the\\npleasures of risk assumption.\\nGiven the conditions that permit or re-\\nquire the holding of inventories, inventories\\nmay have either a stabilizing or a destabi-\\nlizing effect on the commodity\\'s price, pro-\\nduction, and consumption. Traditionally,\\nhowever, economists have assumed that the\\neffect of inventories is to stabilize each of\\nthese. We think of the wheat market, for\\ninstance, where an entire year\\'s new supply\\n(at least in either Hemisphere) becomes\\navailable in a relatively short period of time.\\nWere the holding of inventories of wheat (or\\nwheat products) impossible, the market price\\nwould have to fall low enough during the\\nharvest period to assure immediate consump-\\ntion of the entire crop. The price would then\\nrise high enough during the remainder of the\\nyear to cut off all consumption-or else high\\nenough to make profitable the production\\nof wheat in greenhouses, and to reduce its\\noff-season consumption to the quantity so\\nproduced. However, given the possibility of\\nstorage of wheat or wheat products-by pro-\\nducers, dealers, or intermediate or final con-\\nsumers-the price would normally fall only\\nenough during the harvest period to induce\\nthe appropriate amount of inventory accu-\\nmulation. The price would then rise, during\\nthe remainder of the year, as inventories\\nwere drawn down, sufficiently to cover at all\\ntimes the costs of storage, interest, and the\\nassumption of risk from holding inventories.\\nSuch seasonal price and inventory move-\\nments often are approximately observable.\\nThe recognition that not only seasonal but\\nalso year-to-year variations may occur in the\\nharvest as a result of weather conditions or\\ncivil disturbance, and that year-to-year varia-\\ntions may also occur in the demand for\\nwheat, reflecting, say, the \"business cycle,\"\\nwill induce some or many market par-\\nticipants to carry over inventories of wheat\\n(or of its products) from one crop year to the\\nnext (or to reduce stocks previously carried\\nover). Stocks held will increase or decrease as\\nthe current market price varies relative to\\nwhat is believed to be the current \"normal\"\\nor \"long-run equilibrium\" price: the price\\nthat would exactly balance normal annual\\nnew supply and normal annual consumption.\\nThrough this process, not only seasonal\\nfluctuations but also year-to-year fluctua-\\ntions of market price and of consumption are\\nreduced, even in the presence of substantial\\nyear-to-year changes in production or in fi-\\nnal demand. Through changes in inventories,\\nsupply or demand in any particular year, in\\neffect, may thus borrow from past and/or\\nfrom future years\\' supply or demand.\\nAs, and to the extent, that market par-\\nticipants learn of new \"events\" affecting or\\nlikely to affect either future normal produc-\\ntion or future normal demand, the rate of\\ninventory accumulation or decumulation will\\nbe varied so as to produce a new time path\\nof price and current consumption, associated\\nwith an expected new equilibrium of prices\\nand quantities. Needless to add, this behav-\\nior is stabilizing with respect both to prices\\nand quantities: at least as compared to what\\nwould have happened if inventories could\\nnot exist, or if storage costs-or the interest\\nrate-were higher.

Under such\\ncircumstances, it is not implausible to argue\\nthat rational expectations and inventory\\nadjustments tend to stabilize prices and con-\\nsumption in the presence of random fluctua-\\ntions in supply or demand.3 On the other\\nhand, durable or \" permanent\" changes in\\nsupply or demand alter the equilibrium price,\\nand, almost at once, the actual market price\\nbegins to reflect that change.\\nII. Price Speculation\\nHowever, the existence of large inventories\\nalso introduces the possibility of price insta-\\nbility arising from \"speculation.\" Consider,\\nfor example, the extreme case of gold, when\\nit is only a commodity, and not used as\\nmoney. Gold is obviously very durable. And\\nits consumption and its production in any\\nyear, or even in any decade, are both very\\nsmall relative to the size of the total existing\\nstock. The costs of storage are relatively low.\\nIt is also nearly indestructible: its services as\\nornament or store of value are consumed\\nwith little or no disappearance or dissipation.\\nMost of the gold that was ever mined pre-\\nsumably still exists, and is potentially avail-\\nable as an addition to the market supply\\nfrom new production-at prices deemed suf-\\nficiently above equilibrium. Gold is currently\\nproduced; and its rate of production does\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"respond to its relative price (and to the ex-\\npected price that so strongly influences its\\ncurrent price). But a year's production, even\\nat an historically enormous real price, adds\\nvery little to the current market supply, com-\\npared to that which is available from inven-\\ntories. Changes in the market price may af-\\nfect, at least modestly, the quantities of gold\\ndemanded: by dentists, by manufacturers of\\njewelry and objets d'art, or in industry (as a\\nconductor or chemical). But such changes in\\nquantities demanded are likewise small rela-\\ntive to the size of the stock; and even the\\nmanufacture of gold objects does not really\\nremove them from the inventory of gold.\\nIndeed, unmined gold (and the shares of\\ngold mining companies) are in effect part of\\nthe inventory, too.\\nAlthough the price of gold has some effect\\non its rates of discovery and production, as\\nwell as on its consumption (in the sense of\\nits complete and permanent removal from\\npotential market supply), these responses of\\nquantities produced and consumed are truly\\nminimal in comparison with the size of out-\\nstanding inventories. Thus, the market price\\nof gold depends mainly on peoples' (or, in\\nthe past, on governments') willingness at that\\nprice to hold the immense existing inventory\\nof gold. And this means that the current\\nprice of gold depends mainly on expectations\\nof its future price. As noted earlier, the cur-\\nrent price of a standardized commodity can\\ndiverge from any expected future price only\\nby the relatively small costs of storage plus\\ninterest (and the cost of assuming the risk of\\nan incorrect expectation). But, in the case of\\ngold, a changed expectation of future price is\\nnot soon erased by a changed rate of gold\\nproduction, nor by an altered level of any\\nconsumption that subtracts permanently\\nfrom the stock. There may always be some\\nnormal, long-run equilibrium price of gold\\nthat would exactly equate current production\\nand current consumption (in the sense of\\npermanent disappearance). But that normal\\nprice does not discipline the actual market\\nprice of gold in the way that the normal,\\nlong-run equilibrium price of wheat disci-\\nplines its current market price. Rather-in\\nthe absence of a fixed monetary price of\\ngold-its current price depends overwhelm-\\ningly on the current expectation of what its\\nfuture price will be. And that future price\\nwill depend on the expectation then of its\\nsubsequent price.\\nSuch a market is best characterized by\\nborrowing Keynes' parable (pp. 154-160) of\\nthe beauty contest, which he used to explain\\nshare prices. The price level of shares, he\\nsuggested, depends on each market par-\\nticipant's calculation of what the other par-\\nticipants are likely to expect it to be. It is\\nanalogous to the contest to choose a beauty\\nqueen, he said, in which the prizes go to\\nthose who select the candidate for queen\\nthought most beautiful by the largest num-\\nber of other contestants. Instead of selecting\\nthe candidate who is the most beautiful, each\\ncontestant tries to calculate which candidate\\nis most likely to be chosen by other con-\\ntestants. But once each realizes that others\\nwill be choosing on the same basis, he is\\nforced to speculate about what the average\\nopinion will be of what the average opinion\\nis. And that speculation can be carried to\\nprogressively higher degrees, Keynes sug-\\ngested. Given no more solid a basis than this\\nfor valuing shares, said Keynes, the price of\\nshares can be almost anything-and is likely\\nat times to be highly unstable.\\nWhy does anyone buy gold at $52 an\\nounce-or at $520 an ounce? Why does any-\\none sell it at that price? Because the buyer\\nexpects that the price tomorrow will exceed\\n$52 by more than the cost of carrying an\\nounce of gold; and the seller expects that it\\nmay be less than $52 plus carrying costs\\ntomorrow. Each such expectation in turn\\nreflects buyers' and sellers' judgments about\\nwhat buyers and sellers will be expecting\\ntomorrow for the day after tomorrow. The\\nonly other rational reason for buying or sell-\\ning gold is the pure pleasure of risk assump-\\ntion-better known as gambling. And there\\nis surely much of that in the gold market.\\nPresumably, pure gambling has little net ef-\\nfect on the price, although it does raise the\\nincomes or employment of brokers.4\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

Rather, the difference is that in the\\nwheat and similar cases, the response of\\nquantities produced and/or quantities con-\\nsumed to price changes arising from shifts in\\nsupply or demand can be large enough and\\nprompt enough to begin to move the price\\ntoward its new equilibrium level within a\\nrelevant time period; and that this response\\ntherefore comes to be anticipated by market\\nparticipants. This prompt and substantial\\nstabilizing response of quantities produced\\nand consumed does not occur-and there-\\nfore it is not expected to occur-in the case\\nof gold. As a consequence, in the presence of\\nlarge inventories, price expectations dominate\\nprice-level determination not only in the short\\nterm, but even in the moderately long term.\\nThe prices so determined are unlikely to\\ncontribute either to the stability of produc-\\ntion or consumption, or to the equality of\\nproduction and consumption. They may thus\\nproduce movements in actual inventories, the\\nprice effects of which, however, have only\\nmodest and long-delayed effects in reversing\\nsuch movements.\\nClearly, wheat and gold are more-or-less\\nextreme examples of a spectrum of durable\\ncommodities, capable of storage. At the\\nwheat end of that spectrum, the responses of\\namounts produced and consumed to price\\nchanges are strong and prompt. Market par-\\nticipants come to expect them to occur, and\\ntake actions with respect to inventories that\\ntend to stabilize prices around their equi-\\nlibrium level, including any expected new\\nequilibrium level. At the gold end of the\\nspectrum, the responses of amounts pro-\\nduced and consumed to price changes are\\nweak and slow, while inventories are very\\nlarge.5 Participants in such markets thus can-\\nnot depend on price movements to be quickly\\nself-limiting. It is therefore not irrational for\\nsome or many of them to speculate on the\\ndirection of intermediate price movements.\\nTheir speculation may often extend and ex-\\naggerate price movements that had some\\norigin in changed supply or demand condi-\\ntions. Or it may extend and exaggerate price\\nmovements caused by some random exog-\\nenous disturbance, or even by the actions of\\na few large traders (for example, the Hunts\\nin silver).\\nMost commodity markets lie between these\\nextremes. In such intermediate markets, price\\nmovements may sometimes be-perhaps or-\\ndinarily are-in the direction of a price that\\ntends fairly quickly to equate production and\\nconsumption. At other times, price move-\\nments may develop a cumulative momentum\\nin one direction, which can easily overshoot\\nthe current long-run equilibrium price. Occa-\\nsionally, moreover, speculation can affect\\neven the most stable markets; and specula-\\ntive fevers can be transmitted from one\\nmarket to another.\\nThe years 1971 through 1973 provide a\\nclear example of such speculation and of\\nsuch transmission.6 Coincidental crop failures\\nin wheat and coarse grains in several of the\\nmain producing countries of the world-at a\\ntime when world stocks were severely de-\\npleted-caused grain prices to soar; this\\nhelped to attract public attention to the then\\npopular \"Club-of-Rome\" fantasies of gen-\\neral resource scarcity, which in turn helped\\nto transmit the speculative fever to still other\\ncommodities.

Rational \"Price Bubbles\"\\nThe fact that rational expectations may\\nnot preclude the existence for considerable\\nperiods of speculative, self-maintaining price\\nmovements toward zero or infinity has re-\\ncently been recognized in a rapidly expand-\\ning theoretical literature of working papers\\nand a few published articles.7 Indeed, we are\\nseeing a \"bubble\" of papers on \"rational\\nprice bubbles.\" Whether rational expecta-\\ntions are or are not consistent with price\\nbubbles, however, seems to depend entirely\\non what definition one gives to the \"rational-\\nity\" of rational expectations. One may define\\nas rational any expectation that, if generally\\nacted upon, will turn out to be essentially\\nself-confirming. In that case, price bubbles\\ngenerated by the simplest of extrapolative\\nprice expectations may be consistent with\\nrational behavior. On the other hand, one\\nmay alternatively define as rational only\\nthose expectations that fully incorporate an\\nunderstanding of \" long-run\" \"market funda-\\nmentals\": namely, the assumption by each\\nagent of rationally maximizing behavior by\\neach other agent, each responding to ob-\\nserved changes in prices and quantities as\\nwould occur in a market model of \"long-run\\nequilibrium,\" although observed through a\\nscreen of random, nonserially correlated,\\nshort-run disturbances. Actions based on\\nsuch expectations thus tend to confirm the\\nexpectations; and each confirmation rein-\\nforces further reliance up on the long-term\\nequilibrium model. There seems little room\\nfor price bubbles in that version of rational\\nexpectations.\\nBut whether, and to what extent, market\\nfundamentals will, in fact, prevail, surely de-\\npends, as I have argued above, on the dura-\\nbility of the commodity, its storage costs,\\nand particularly on the degree to which, and\\nthe speed with which, its production and\\nconsumption are affected by expected price.\\nGiven the world as it is, I suggest that the\\n\"fundamentals\" do not always and every-\\nwhere prevail. Bubbles do occur, and are\\nimportant.\\nHowever, most or all of the new literature\\non price bubbles appears to deal only with\\nprice movements away from, or back to-\\nwards, the equilibrium price that reflects\\nlong-run market fundamentals. It thus im-\\nplies that, when prices are, for any period,\\napproximately stable, they must therefore\\nbe at or close to an equilibrium dictated\\nby market fundamentals-reflecting, at that\\nprice, an approximate balance between the\\nexpected supply from new production and\\nthe expected demand for final consumption.\\nPrice bubbles, in contrast, involve an extrap-\\nolation of expected price movements (how-\\never originating), causing further movement\\nin the same direction.\\nIn my view, however, where the impacts of\\nprice on amounts produced and consumed\\nare small, slow, and uncertain, a speculative\\nprice-(i.e., a nonequilibrium price) is not\\nalways or necessarily a moving price. The\\nprice may rest for a considerable period of\\ntime at-or fluctuate narrowly around-a\\nlevel far above (or below) any equilibrium\\ndetermined by market fundamentals. This\\nsituation might represent either the extrapo-\\nlation of an originally accidental stability, or\\na standoff between expectations of further\\nrise by some participants and the expectation\\nof fall by others.8\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Macroeconomic Inventory Theory\\nLet us now turn to some of the macroeco-\\nnomic implications of this microeconomic\\ntheory of commodity prices and inventories.\\nFirst, and most important, is to recognize\\nthat there is nothing in standard price the-\\nory-even when we expand it to take account\\nof speculative demands for inventories, price\\nbubbles, or of the possible transmission of\\nspeculative fever from one market to an-\\nother-that implies that the aggregate stock\\nof inventories, and the rate of aggregate\\ninventory accumulation for an entire econ-\\nomy should exhibit any systematic variation\\nover time. Random disturbances to supply\\nand/or demand for particular commodities\\nor products might lead to periods of net\\naccumulation or net decumulation of inven-\\ntories of those products. But the aggregation\\nof many time-series, each subject to random,\\nnon-serially-correlated variation, produces\\nonly a time-series with proportionally smaller\\nvariation. Thus, several years of systematic\\ngeneral accumulation of inventories, fol-\\nlowed by substantial periods of general\\ndecumulation of inventories, finds no basis\\nin conventional price theory.\\nYet one of the most obvious macroeco-\\nnomic facts of life is the existence of pro-\\nnounced cycles, both in the size of aggregate\\ninventories and in their rate of accumulation.\\nIndeed, of all of the conventional subaggre-\\ngates of real national product, the one that\\nshows the greatest decrease (not merely in\\npercentage but in aggregate dollar amount)\\nbetween periods of business expansion and\\nof business contraction is, almost invariably,\\nthat of the net addition to business invento-\\nries. This total typically goes from a large\\npositive amount at business cycle peaks to\\na large negative amount at business cycle\\ntroughs. This difference exceeds the typical\\ncyclical decline in business investment in\\nplant and equipment, in residential construc-\\ntion, in purchases by consumers or govern-\\nments, or in net exports. The existence of\\nthese pronounced cycles in aggregate inven-\\ntory accumulation has long challenged mac-\\nroeconomists to develop theories that might\\nexplain this phenomenon. The response to\\nthis challenge has produced a second and\\nmacroeconomic literature about inventories,\\nthat is almost completely nonintersecting\\nwith microeconomic price theory.\\nIn this macroeconomic inventory litera-\\nture, prices and price expectations are rare-\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

This second literature deals\\nprimarily with work-in-process and manufac-\\ntured product inventories, including inven-\\ntories held by wholesalers and retailers-\\nalthough it may also embrace commodity\\ninventories held by manufacturers or proces-\\nsors (but not by producers and dealers). The\\nearliest versions of this literature described\\ninventories as being held, increased, or re-\\nduced as the result of production or ordering\\ndecisions that were based upon expectations\\nof future changes in quantities produced or\\ndemanded-expectations generated mainly\\nby recently experienced levels of production\\nor sales. It purported to describe the determi-\\nnants, for example, of the desired and actual\\nstocks of coal and iron ore held by steel\\nmills; of the desired and actual inventories of\\nfinished steel held by mills, steel warehouses,\\nor steel-using manufacturers; of the desired\\nand actual inventories of automobiles held\\nby producers and dealers; and of the desired\\nstocks and actual stocks of steel bedsprings\\nheld by department stores. In early versions\\nof this macroeconomic literature, inventory\\ndecisions were shown to be capable of hav-\\ning highly destabilizing macroeconomic ef-\\nfects-particularly when expectations of fu-\\nture sales were modelled as responsive in\\nparticular ways to experienced levels and\\nchanges of sales, while production responded\\nto orders and expected sales.9\\nThis literature, of course, belongs to a\\nuniverse of discourse in which prices (includ-\\ning wage rates) do not clear markets continu-\\nously, but rather adjust slowly to evidence of\\ngaps between amounts supplied and de-\\nmanded. Or they may be \"administered\" on\\nthe basis of working rules of thumb based\\nmainly on costs or on other prices. In this\\nuniverse of discourse, such pricing rules are\\nnot necessarily irrational, given the limited\\nextent of knowledge, and the experience of\\npast instability. And, since prices so estab-\\nlished do not typically cause production and\\nconsumption to move quickly into approxi-\\nmate equality, market participants do not\\nexpect that prices will so move, and therefore\\nthey do not so move. Rather, production and\\nsales are brought toward equality primarily\\nby changes-delayed changes-in planned\\nrates of production or purchase, that reflect\\nobserved or expected changes in quantities\\nconsumed or used in production, and that\\nare designed to restore or to maintain effi-\\ncient levels of inventories. Indeed, microeco-\\nnomic theories of rational quantity adjust-\\nments to unplanned differences between\\nproduction and sales began to be developed\\nin the early 1950\\'s, and have increasingly\\nsupplied a formal basis for macroeconomic\\ninventory theory.\\'0 These fluctuations in\\nquantities produced or purchased may lead,\\nin the face of relatively inflexible prices and\\nwages, to further self-reinforcing changes in\\nproduction, purchases, and employment-\\nself-reinforcing through income effects on\\nconsumption and \"accelerator\" effects on in-\\nvestment: perhaps dampened by interest rate\\neffects on investment, to the extent that the\\nsupply of money does not accommodate\\nchanges in the demand for it.\\nIndeed, if such patterns of quantity re-\\nsponses at the level of the firm to unplanned\\nchanges in inventories become standard-\\nized-because such patterns do, in time, re-\\nverse imbalances between production and\\nsales-it may become entirely rational to\\nexpect such patterns of quantity movements\\nto occur at a macroeconomic level. Rational\\nexpectations based on such \"theories\" could\\nthen lead to inventory, production, and\\npurchase decisions that help to perpetuate the\\nmacroeconomic instability of production, con-\\nsumption, and inventories.\\nPersistent and massive macroeconomic in-\\nventory cycles deny either the existence of\\nrational expectations, or, more plausibly, the\\nability of such expectations to stabilize out-\\nput and employment.

If\\nthe price of labor services was a flexible,\\ncontinually market-determined price, the\\nprice of labor services should respond rather\\nsharply to random shocks to the demand for\\ngoods produced using labor. Indeed, prices\\nof labor should, in general, be more variable\\nthan prices of commodities, on the reason-\\nable assumption that the supply of labor is\\nless price elastic than the supply of cooperat-\\ning factors of production.\"\\nIn fact, of course, the evidence is undeni-\\nable that wage rates normally fluctuate far\\nless than do prices.

And\\nwhether or not there was a Prince with a\\nprinting press, there were competitive banks,\\naggressively lending at a flexible price to\\nbusinesses. Given a plausible (although in-\\ncompletely specified) lag structure, Wicksell\\nshowed that banks\\' competition in money\\ncreation might initially reduce the price for\\nloans; and their continuing money creation\\nmight keep it depressed for a time. Through\\nthis means, investment, financed by bank\\ncredit, could exceed ex ante saving, crowding\\nout consumption. The result, of course, was\\nalso inflation, unanticipated by all. Once the\\nlimits of money creation were reached, the\\nboom collapsed.\\nAt roughly the same time, in another part\\nof Europe, J. A.

They in-\\nclude:\\n1) The price level for loans: some partic-\\nular rate of interest, or some average of rates,\\nat which investment can be financed;\\n2) The demand-price level of new capital\\ngoods, reflecting their physical productivity,\\nthe prices of the goods produced by their\\nuse, and the supply-prices of cooperating\\nfactors of production;\\n3) The supply-price level for new capital\\ngoods, sometimes taken as a function of their\\nrate of production;\\n4) The supply-price and the demand-price\\nlevels of entrepreneurship and innovation;\\n5) The supply-price levels of risk and/or\\nuncertainty bearing, by investors and lenders;\\n6) The level and nature of the prices\\nimposed by government; taxes and their struc-\\nture; and\\n7) The price level of ownership of exist-\\ning enterprises; that is, the level of share\\nprices.\\nThe question is not which among these\\nprice levels are relevant for investment: all of\\nthem (and others) are doubtless relevant to\\nsome degree. Rather, the question is: which\\nare \"strategically\" important?

The\\nratio of these two global magnitudes has\\ncome to be designated as \"q.\"\\nI propose to conclude these comments on\\nprice-theoretical explanations of investment\\nwith a few remarks on the q theory. The\\nKeynes-Tobin approach makes the volume\\nof aggregate investment dependent upon\\n-indeed, ordinarily taken as proportional\\nto-the excess of q over 1: where q is the\\nratio of the market value of enterprises to the\\nreplacement cost of their assets. The market\\nvalue of enterprises includes the value both\\nof equities and debts, as currently priced in\\nsecurity markets; the replacement cost of\\ntheir assets is the reproduction cost of exist-\\ning plant, equipment, and inventories at cur-\\nrent price levels.\"9\\nHowever formulated in detail, the q theory\\nof course employs much of the same infor-\\nmation that is used in other macroeconomic\\ntheories of investment. For example, most\\ninvestment theories incorporate a bond-\\nmarket interest yield, presumably to repre-\\nsent the cost of borrowed long-term funds,\\nor the alternate return on owned funds. Some\\ninvestment theories may use short-term in-\\nterest rates, as well, to represent the cost of\\n(or the alternative return on) funds borrowed\\nto finance inventories or other working\\ncapital, or to finance the purchase of capital\\ngoods while awaiting more favorable rates in\\nthe long-term market. The q theory incorpo-\\nrates interest rates as they affect the value of\\nmarketable debt claims against enterprises.\\nThis use of interest rates in the q theory is\\nthus conventional in investment theory.\\nWhat is essentially unique about the q\\nformulation is its inclusion of the market\\nvalue of stocks: the price level of ownership\\nof corporations. This can be thought of as an\\nindirect measure of the cost (or opportunity\\ncost) of equity funds.20 Given the typical\\nvolatility of share prices, medium-run move-\\nments of q are often or perhaps ordinarily\\ndominated by changes in the prices and thus\\nthe market value of outstanding shares.\\nWith that in mind, let me recall to you my\\nearlier discussion of the speculative demand\\nfor and supply of storable commodi-\\nties-gold was the specific example.

Our con-\\ncensus on micro issues arises from a shared\\nmodel of how markets work in the long run.\\nOur division on macro issues stems from a\\nnumber of reasons, the emphasis on which\\nhas shifted over the years. In recent times the\\nmain disagreement has centered on how\\nmarkets perform in the short run. In particu-\\nlar, we cannot agree on why nominal wages\\nare sticky on the face of aggregate demand\\nshocks. The traditional view argues that\\nwages are structurally sticky. The new classi-\\ncal macroeconomists argue that wages are\\nfundamentally flexible. But the rational ex-\\npectations of economic agents, grounded on\\npast experience with attempts at employ-\\nment-supporting monetary policy, have pro-\\nduced the observed wage stickiness. Intro-\\nduction of a changed policy regime, based on\\na stable growth path for the money supply or\\nsome similar rule, would-so the argument\\ngoes-eventually change the pattern of ex-\\npectations and eliminate the stickiness.\\nA large and rapidly expanding body of\\nrecent research on implicit contracts, prin-\\ncipal-agent relationships, and related sub-\\njects has begun to flesh out our knowledge of\\nwhy wages are sticky. Almost universally the\\nimplicit contract and related literature con-\\ncludes that optimal behavior implies a good\\ndeal less wage flexibility in the face of changes\\nin the marginal revenue product of labor\\nthan would occur in the spot auction markets\\nof the Walrasian model. But this literature\\ndeals with the stickiness of real and relative\\nwages in response to shocks of various kinds.\\nIt seems to have little to say about the mac-\\nroeconomic stickiness of nominal wages. A\\nmicro theory of real wage stickiness may\\nhelp explain the difficulty of adjusting to\\nsudden large changes in aggregate supply\\nconditions like the two oil shocks of the\\n1970\\'s.

Some Relevant Features of the Implicit\\nContract Literature\\nBy now the literature on implicit contracts\\nis so large and so diverse that I cannot do it\\njustice in a brief summary. But it is necessary\\nto sketch out a few elements of that research,\\npaying particular attention to several key\\nfeatures that bear on the relationship be-\\ntween wage behavior and aggregate demand\\nshocks.\\nThe flexible-price, market-clearing model,\\nin which economic agents are price takers\\nand prompt quantity adjusters, would be a\\nuseful paradigm in a very particular kind of\\nworld. In this world labor and product\\nmarkets would be characterized by a great\\ndeal of homogeneity, and so individual trans-\\nactions would be carried on in very \"thick\"\\nmarkets. There would be no reason for pre-\\nserving a continuity of relationships between\\nworkers and firms, customers and suppliers,\\nlenders and borrowers. Workers would be\\ninterchangeable; the marginal revenue prod-\\nuct of a particular class of workers would be\\nthe same regardless of the firm to which the\\nworker was attached. Either labor effort could\\nbe easily monitored or it would be com-\\npletely proportional to labor hours paid for.\\nAnd, wherever commitments had to be made\\nfor the future, expectations about the im-\\nportant variables entering into the decision\\ncould be drawn from fixed stochastic distri-\\nbutions, knowledge of which, in turn, could\\nbe derived from the recurrent nature of past\\nevents. As well as being unbiased, forecasts\\ncould significantly improve on coin-flips.\\nThe world that we are trying to model,\\nhowever, is in fact different in several fun-\\ndamental ways. Most importantly, in a\\nsubstantial part of the economy there are\\nlarge returns to maintaining the continuity of\\nassociation between workers and firms.\\nWorkers acquire nontransferable, firm-\\nspecific skills; and some of the cost of the\\nacquisition may be paid by the firm. They\\nacquire knowledge about the nonwage attri-\\nbutes of a job through experience on thal\\njob. Continuity of association also provides\\nfirms with hard-to-come-by knowledge about\\nthe reliability and productivity of specific\\nworkers. Additional transition, search, and\\nmoving costs are incurred by workers and\\nfirms when the association is broken. Sub-\\nstantial bilateral monopoly rents to continu-\\nity are thus generated among firms and their\\nexperienced work force.\\nRisk aversion introduces another reason\\nfor continuity of association. For at least\\nsome range of possible variations in the eco-\\nnomic environment facing a firm, it is likely\\nto be less risk averse than its workers. But\\nthe relevant insurance contracts cannot be\\ntraded separately from employment con-\\ntracts, and so continuity of association be-\\ncomes a joint product with insurance. Fi-\\nnally, in the real world, labor time is not\\nsynonymous with performance. Monitoring\\nworker performance or effort is costly, but\\nthe payment of higher than the \"going wage\"\\nwill bind workers to the firms with an incen-\\ntive to avoid shirking. And the particular\\nworkers who \"survive\" the monitoring are\\nthose who have found the premium sufficient\\nto avoid monitorable shirking, a piece of\\nvaluable information to the firm flowing from\\ncontinuity of association.\\nRealizing the benefits from long-term\\nworker-firm relationships requires, of course,\\nsome sort of explicit or implicit agreement\\nbetween employers and workers on the terms\\nof the relationship, especially with respect to\\nwages and employment opportunities. Several\\nproblems in modeling these long-term work-\\ner-firm agreements have dominated the re-\\ncent literature. First, when the marginal rev-\\nenue product of labor changes, how are wages\\nand employment to be adjusted while still\\npreserving contractual relationships? Second,\\nsince firms are much better able than workers\\nto observe the marginal product of labor and\\nsince contingent contracts directly tied to the\\nvarious states of nature cannot practically be\\ndesigned, how can contract terms allow for\\nsome flexibility in meeting changing condi-\\ntions without giving employers incentives\\nto provide false information about labor\\'s\\nmarginal product?

Analysis of this issue has\\ngiven rise to the concept of a firm\\'s labor\\nmarket \"reputation,\" or brand-name capital,\\nfear of losing which provides an enforcement\\nconstraint. This is the problem of en-\\nforcement.\\nThree major strands of the literature on\\nimplicit contracts can be discerned, each of\\nwhich emphasizes one of the rationales for\\nthe continuity of association (without neces-\\nsarily denying the existence of other aspects),\\nand each of which deals somewhat differ-\\nently with the problems cited in the prior\\nparagraph.\\' The earliest version of implicit\\ncontracts emphasized the role of risk aver-\\nsion, firms being either risk neutral or less\\nrisk averse than workers to fluctuations in\\ntheir income.2 Firms thus offer risk-sharing\\ncontracts that improve social welfare relative\\nto spot auction markets. Another body of\\nresearch stresses transactions costs and asset\\nspecificity -that is, the acquisition of firm-\\nspecific skills by workers, and specific and\\nvaluable knowledge about each other by both\\nfirms and workers.3 This approach also em-\\nphasizes the asymmetry of knowledge be-\\ntween firms and workers about the marginal\\nrevenue product of labor, and its influence\\non the nature of the contract.

Some Extensions to Implicit Contract Theory\\nWe can distinguish several categories and\\nsubcategories of changes in economic cir-\\ncumstances, the wage response to which must\\nbe accommodated by social conventions and\\ninformal understandings that we call implicit\\ncontracts. Let us consider first some of the\\nimplications of contract theory as it deals\\nwith the response of wages to changes in the\\nrelative conditions facing individual firms or\\nlabor markets. For that purpose I define\\nrelative changes to be those which occur on\\nthe assumption that the perceived general\\nlevel of opportunities facing workers-call\\nit W-remains unchanged in real and nomi-\\nnal terms. (The relevant W is, of course, in\\nreal terms. But since we are here abstracting\\nfrom any aggregate disturbances, real and\\nnominal W are the same.) In turn there are\\ntwo kinds of relative changes in economic\\nconditions that implicit contracts must allow\\nfor; changes which are realizations of a prob-\\nability distribution known at the time the\\ncontract is entered, and those stemming from\\ndevelopments to which no basis could be\\nfound for assigning probabilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'To deal with implicit labor contracts\\ncovering the long tenures that are typical in\\nU.S. industry, it is necessary to make the\\ncurrently out-of-fashion distinction between\\nrisk and uncertainty. Most of the mathemati-\\ncal modeling of implicit contracts has as-\\nsumed that workers and firms base their\\nagreements on a known probability distribu-\\ntion (presumably commonly held) of the rel-\\nevant variables, most importantly the mar-\\nginal revenue product of labor or some\\nrelated variable. The distribution of the mean\\nexpected bilateral monopoly rents from con-\\ntinuity is decided at the beginning of the\\ncontract on the basis of the known distribu-\\ntion of possible economic environments that\\nwill be faced over the life of the contract,\\nand the contract then specifies the behavior\\nof wages (and in some cases employment) as\\nthe realization of that distribution occurs.\\nThe wage is either rigid or changes sluggishly\\nin the face of these changing realizations.\\nBut recent research on the surprisingly long\\nlengths of job tenure in the United States\\ncasts doubt on the usefulness and sufficiency\\nof this assumption. Robert Hall (1980) has\\nestimated that, in 1973, half of all work in\\nAmerica was done on jobs whose completed\\ntenures were fifteen years or more. And for\\nmen alone the relevant completed job tenure\\nwas twenty-five years! Douglas Wolf and\\nFrank Levy (1984) reached very similar con-\\nclusions on the basis of a 1979 survey. The\\ncontracts, rules-of-behavior, and social con-\\nventions that make possible such long associ-\\nations must be such as to allow wages to\\nadjust appropriately in response to changes\\nin circumstances whose probability of occur-\\nrence could not be determined in advance. In\\nother words, the informal agreements which\\nmake possible long-term association between\\nworkers and employers must take into\\naccount Knightian uncertainty about future\\npossible outcomes. With respect to many of\\npossible states of the world, over such a long\\nperiod of time, there is no basis in past\\nstatistical regularities for knowing the distri-\\nbution. As William Nordhaus (1976) points\\nout, contracts must take account of changes\\nin the economic climate (i.e., when the\\nparameters of the distribution shift) as well\\nas changes in the economic weather (i.e., as\\nrealizations of the known distribution).\\nMost of the possible long-term changes to\\nbe faced by firms and workers do not result\\nfrom the cyclical variance of aggregates, like\\nnational income and output, but from\\nchanges in relative variables potentially re-\\nsponding to a bewildering permutation of\\npossibilities. Seen in 1973, what were the\\nrationally expected probabilities of the 1974\\nand 1979 oil price increases, the introduction\\nand growth of personal computers, or the\\nChrysler brush with bankruptcy? Compared\\nto workers, firms may indeed be relatively\\nrisk neutral to temporary changes in income\\nfollowing some known distribution. But no\\nfirm is so risk neutral and has such unlimited\\naccess to capital as to enter upon or honor\\ncontacts specifying rigid wages or some fixed\\nfunction of wages on employment over very\\nlong periods,6 when no rational basis exists\\nfor specifying the distribution of outcomes.\\nSome of the modern wage literature (for\\nexample, Hall and David Lilien, 1979; San-\\nford Grossman and Oliver Hart, 1981) mod-\\nels a contract with a \"lump-sum\" distribu-\\ntion of the rents-that is, an amount to be\\npaid the workers regardless of unemploy-\\nment status-and a marginal compensation,\\npaid when the worker is employed and itself\\nan agreed upon increasing function of the\\nlevel of labor input. Employers then de-\\ntermine employment by maximizing profits\\nin the light of the marginal compensation\\nschedule. In these approaches, the climatic\\nchanges to which I refer would be an occa-\\nsion for changing the basic lump sum distri-\\nbution of the rents.\\nA workable distinction can thus be made\\nbetween those contract provisions which deal\\nwith wages in the face of moderate and\\ntemporary changes in the marginal product\\nof labor that are perceived as the realization\\nof a known probability distribution and those\\nprovisions which deal with climatic and per-\\nmanent changes, the probability of whose\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

With respect to changes in labor de-\\nmand that are perceived to be consistent\\nwith a previously known distribution, im-\\nplicit contract theory predicts either rigid\\nwages or-in the models like those of Hall\\nand Lilien and Grossman and Hart-wages\\nwhich move less than spot auction markets\\nwould predict but are positively correlated\\nwith the level of employment. But the infor-\\nmal agreements or generally accepted con-\\nventions that we call implicit contracts must\\nalso provide for changes in circumstances\\nwhose probability cannot rationally be es-\\ntimated at the time workers enter into the\\ncontract. These climatic changes in economic\\ncircumstances can be of several broad kinds.\\nThey might involve a relatively long-term\\nchange, because of shifts in demand or costs,\\nin the rents available to be shared by a firm\\nand its workers. Long-term changes in the\\nrelative demand and supply of particular\\noccupations or in particular local labor\\nmarkets will also call for changes in relative\\nwages around a given W.\\nIf the present value of the stream of bene-\\nfits to workers (wages and employment prob-\\nabilities) flowing from continuing with the\\nfirm begins to decline relative to the alterna-\\ntive combination of initial investment costs\\nand future rents that can be generated at\\nother firms, it is appropriate that contract\\nterms signal the information to workers, so\\nthat they can make the relevant comparisons,\\nand decide whether to quit the firm. Simi-\\nlarly, if a substantial and permanent decline\\noccurs in the relative demand for labor by\\noccupation or locality, wages ought to signal\\nthe change. Conversely, economic circum-\\nstances might increase the rents to be divided\\nmaking it optimal for the firm to enlarge its\\nshare of the relevant labor market pool of\\nexperienced workers. In that case, the signal\\nof higher relative wages ought to be trans-\\nmitted to attract from other firms or occupa-\\ntions workers for whom the lost rents are less\\nthan the improved opportunities.\\nAn efficient determination of wages must\\nthus cope with two hard-to-reconcile sets of\\nfacts. Because long continuity of association\\nbetween firms and specific workers confers\\nsubstantial benefits on both parties, rent-\\nsharing arrangements that offer protection\\nagainst exploitation and promote such con-\\ntinuity are profitable. But the period of as-\\nsociation is so long that the probability dis-\\ntribution of circumstances requiring changes\\nin wages is largely unknowable. And so the\\nrules and conventions governing wage de-\\ntermination must be flexible enough to allow\\nresponse. Seen in this light, the terms \"im-\\nplicit contract\" may be misleading. It is, I\\nthink, useful to think of wages as being\\nset and periodically revised by firms with-\\nin limits imposed by a set of social conven-\\ntions, concepts of equity and fairness, and\\ninformal understandings. These conventions,\\nconcepts, and understandings provide sub-\\nstantial, if imperfect, protection against ex-\\nploitation but allow flexibility to deal with\\nKnightian uncertainty.\\nWhile very lengthy association requires\\nrelative wage adjustments in response to\\n\" unforeseeable\" changes in circumstances,\\nother characteristics of the labor market sug-\\ngest that those adjustments will tend to be\\ngradual and delayed. It would be hard to\\naccount for the long job tenures that we\\nobserve unless the combination of positive\\nreturns to association and the cost of transi-\\ntion were quite sizeable. The quantitative\\nevidence on the magnitude of explicit turn-\\nover costs suggests that they are large. Daniel\\nMitchell and Larry Kimbell (1982), for ex-\\nample, report a recent estimate, based on a\\nsurvey of Los Angeles firms, that firms\\' own\\ncosts of turnover (exit costs plus replacement\\ncosts) averaged $3,600, $2,300, and $10,400\\nfor production, clerical, and salary-exempt\\nworkers, respectively.\\nUnder these circumstances, erroneous sig-\\nnals can have asymmetrical results. Changes\\nin wages undertaken on the mistaken iden-\\ntification of a temporary change in cir-\\ncumstances as a permanent change can cause\\na substantial loss to workers and firms from\\nthe unnecessary scrapping of \"investment\"\\nand the incurring of other turnover costs.\\nEntire rent streams are wiped out to the\\nextent that workers having transferred to\\nother firms cannot return when the mistake\\nis discovered. Moreover, once experienced\\nworkers do change jobs, it is likely to take\\nseveral tries before they find another long-\\ntenure job. Hall (1982), for example, shows\\nthat in 1978 a worker aged 45-49 who was in\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

As a consequence, the losses\\nfrom the errors will be a continuous positive\\nfunction of the size of the errors. Errors of\\nthe opposite type-failing to introduce a\\ncontract change to meet a permanent alter-\\nation in the climate-can be reversed at a\\nmuch smaller cost. Some workers will have\\nremained too long with a particular firm,\\nwhile a smaller group will have lost income\\nfrom the higher layoffs associated with this\\ntype of error. But these losses are likely to be\\nmuch smaller than the loss of the rent stream\\nitself, unless the error persists for a long\\ntime.\\nThus, given Knightian uncertainty about\\neconomic conditions over the long length of\\njob tenures, implicit contracts must allow for\\nthe possibility of relative wage changes in the\\nface of climatic changes in external condi-\\ntions. But the interest of both firms and\\nworkers dictates that those changes occur\\nonly after enough information has been\\naccumulated to warrant a high probability\\nforecast that the change is permanent. To\\njustify a substantial wage adjustment, it is\\nnot sufficient that the firm act on unbiased\\nforecasts-they must also acquire some con-\\nfidence in the accuracy of the forecasts.\\nOne might object to this line of reasoning\\non grounds that failure to adjust wages\\nquickly enough while the evidence is accu-\\nmulating that the change in circumstances is\\npermanent, is itself likely to send out wrong\\nsignals. If, for example, wages are slow to\\nadjust downward when the demand for labor\\nfalls, employment will decline. Why will\\nworkers not take this as a signal that the\\nfuture stream of benefits from staying in the\\ncurrent job have declined relative to earlier\\nanticipation? There are a number of reasons\\nwhy this objection is not valid. First, a change\\nin wages is known immediately, while it takes\\nsome time to begin to realize that an actual\\nchange in employment reflects a shift in the\\nlong-term distribution of employment prob-\\nabilities. Second, the common practice of\\nlayoffs subject to recall is a way for a firm to\\nsignal that the lower employment is expected\\nto be temporary. Third, significant down-\\nward changes in relative wages are not lightly\\nmade. Given the inability of workers easily to\\nassess the magnitude of the available rents,\\nfirms are deterred from exploiting the bi-\\nlateral monopoly relationship through the\\ndamage they might do to their \"reputations\"\\nand the future increases in employment costs\\nthereby imposed. Since reputation is a fragile\\nasset, and since workers are naturally less\\nlikely than firms to interpret current facts as\\nwarranting a relative wage cut, firms must\\nwait until a substantial body of evidence\\npoints in the required direction. The efficiency\\nwage literature emphasizes the unfavorable\\nproductivity consequences of relative wage\\nreductions that turn out to be unwarranted.\\nAnd, since firms know that it is difficult to\\nreduce wages once they have been raised,\\nthey do not want to make a mistake in the\\nupward direction. As a consequence, wage\\nchanges that survive these barriers are much\\nmore clearly interpreted as a signal that the\\nstream of future rents has changed than are\\nvariations in employment.\\nEfficient implicit wage contracts, in the\\npresence of uncertainty, must also have the\\ncharacteristic that they minimize \"haggling\\ncosts.\" They should not lead to a constantly\\nrenewed battle over the division of the rents.\\nFrequent struggles would waste resources,\\npossibly reduce productivity, and erode\\nscarce reputation capital, thereby reducing\\nthe probability of long-tenure associations.\\nThese considerations argue that significant\\nrelative wage adjustments to meet perceived\\npermanent changes in condition be an infre-\\nquent occurrence and not lightly changed\\nonce made.\\nIn sum, modern contract theory concludes\\nthat relative wages will tend to be quite\\nsticky in comparison to predictions from the\\nauction market model, in the face of changes\\nin conditions that are the realizations of\\nknown probability distributions-what I\\nhave loosely called temporary changes.

Response to Aggregate Demand Shocks\\nSo far we have considered a world in\\nwhich only relative or local changes are per-\\nmitted, a world in which the nominal and\\nreal value of the general wage level, or the\\nwage \"norm,\" was fixed. Now impose ag-\\ngregate demand shocks on such a world,\\noptimal adjustment to which requires a\\nchange in the path of average prices and\\nwages. (For simplicity of exposition we will\\nbe considering only aggregate demand\\nshocks, and exclude aggregate shocks to the\\nsupply curve, like those arising from OPEC-\\nimposed oil price increases or from crop\\nshortages. We can thus assume that the equi-\\nlibrium solution will not call for changes in\\naggregate real wages.) An efficient system of\\nimplicit contracts must obviously provide for\\nadjustments in the nominal wages of individ-\\nual firms when changes occur in the average\\nlevel of nominal wages, W. Under the social\\nconventions and understandings which gov-\\nern wage determination, there is a rebuttable\\npresumption that-barring the existence of\\ncircumstances which call for changes in real\\nand relative wages-nominal wages in each\\nfirm will be adjusted in line with observed\\nchanges in prices and wages generally. But\\nthis process of wage determination does not\\ngenerate prompt and flexible adjustment of\\naggregate nominal wages to nominal shocks.\\nA change in the average level of wages is the\\nproduct of changes in wages by individual\\nfirms. To the extent that individual wage\\nadjustments must wait on changes in the\\naverage, aggregate nominal wage flexibility\\nwill not be a characteristic of the system.\\nAnd, as discussed below, this is also true, but\\nto a somewhat lesser degree, of the wage\\nresponse to price changes. Given the sub-\\nstantial costs of sticky nominal wages to\\nsociety as a whole and to individual firms\\nand their workers, is there not some other\\nadjustment mechanism which would gener-\\nate a prompt and flexible nominal wage re-\\nsponse, preserving relative wages but produc-\\ning the desired nominal flexibility?\\nSeveral lines of inquiry suggest themselves.\\nFirst, why are not nominal wages explicitly\\nindexed to some aggregate nominal indica-\\ntor, producing the appropriate change in W\\nin response to aggregate demand shocks?\\nSecond, even with relative wage stickiness,\\nwould not rational firms and their workers\\nforecast the ultimate equilibrium change in\\nW and promptly set individual wages ac-\\ncordingly?

       " \"Let us start with the issue of indexing\\nwages in individual firms to the general price\\nlevel. In the United States, wages are not\\nwidely protected against changes in price by\\nexplicit indexing formulae. In 1983, only 58\\npercent of union workers were covered by\\nCOLAs. On the average, the ones that were,\\nreceived protection against only 53 percent\\nof the changes in the CPI. Jo Anna Gray\\n(1978) and Stanley Fischer (1977) examined\\nthe conditions under which indexing would\\nor would not be optimal for individual firms\\ngiven the assumption that wages once set are\\nnot renegotiated for some period. The main\\nconclusion from this research is that, in the\\nface of real (as opposed to nominal) shocks,\\nindexing, by freezing real wages, produces\\nreal wage results that are not optimal for the\\nfirm. Given the probability that nominal and\\nreal shocks are both likely to occur, Gray\\nshows that partial indexing will be an opti-\\nmal choice. Moreover, even nominal shocks\\nare likely, during the transition to a new\\nequilibrium, to have nonneutral effects; the\\nfirm's product price and the Consumer Price\\nIndex may not move in parallel. As a conse-\\nquence, indexing would have unwanted real\\neffects even in the face of monetary shocks.\\nWhile we have seen that some degree of real\\nwage stickiness is optimal, the absence of full\\nindexing even in multiyear union contracts\\nindicates that the opposite extreme- auto-\\nmatic guarantees of a fixed real wage over\\nseveral years-is not a workable approach.\\nWithin-year indexing is virtually nonex-\\nistent in annual union contracts and in the\\nannual wage adjustment cycle followed by\\nthe vast bulk of nonunion firms. Under im-\\nplicit contracts, changes in the path of aver-\\nage wages and prices in the economy as a\\nwhole or in relevant submarkets are com-\\nmonly agreed to constitute a major element\\nin determining the size of those annual wage\\nadjustments. But, in the United States, it is\\nalmost universally the practice not to make\\nthe relationship to the price level or to aver-\\nage wages an explicit and automatic one,\\neither within the year or over longer periods.\\nAnd, as noted earlier, in those multiyear\\nunion contracts where indexing is found, that\\nindexing is almost always less than complete.\\nHaggling costs are apparently minimized by\\nmaking periodic wage adjustments that si-\\nmultaneously take into account nominal, real,\\nand relative factors, rather than by fixing the\\nnominal relationship in a formula and sep-\\narately adjusting for changes in real and\\nrelative conditions.\\nIn any event, even if wages were fully\\nindexed to prices, they would not produce\\nhighly flexible nominal wages in response to\\naggregate demand shocks. The cumulative\\ncosts of wage indexing, in the face of real\\nshocks and the transitional nonneutrality of\\nnominal shocks, would be severely ex-\\nacerbated if the indexing were instantaneous.\\nAs a consequence, the indexing we do ob-\\nserve-except in countries which have devel-\\noped extremely rapid and sustained inflation\\n-typically involves a substantial lag be-\\ntween observed price changes and wage ad-\\njustments. Such indexing only guarantees a\\ngradual response of wages to aggregate de-\\nmand shocks in proportion as prices them-\\nselves are flexible in the face of constant\\nwages. Even if prices were competitively de-\\ntermined, the economy would still have to\\nwork its way through a series of price-wage-\\nprice reactions in each one of which prices\\nfell, relative to wages, by an amount depend-\\ning on the slope of the marginal cost curves.\\nAnd prices do not move with such frequency\\nor flexibility. Arthur Okun (1981) has care-\\nfully elaborated the reasons why, in the\\ncustomer markets which predominate in\\nmodern economies, prices are not likely to\\nmove quickly and easily up and down a\\nmarginal cost curve. Robert Gordon (1981)\\nhas elaborated how the highly articulated\\ninput-output relationships of modern econo-\\nmies tend to slow the price reaction to ag-\\ngregate demand shocks. And George Akerlof\\nand Janet Yellen (1984) have recently shown\\nthat in less than perfectly competitive markets\\ninertial price-setting behavior in response to\\na shock may impose only second-order losses\\non the firms who follow such behavior, even\\nthough the macro result may be first-order\\nlosses for the economy.8 Everything else\\n\\n###\",\n",

Robert Gordon (1981, 1983) has\\nidentified a number of reasons, why, even if\\nthe appropriate split could be made between\\ntrend and disturbances, indexing wages to\\nnominal GNP would not be feasible in im-\\nplicit contracts. If prices themselves are not\\ncompletely flexible relative to wages, declines\\nin nominal GNP under an indexed system\\nwould produce long periods with unwar-\\nranted real wage decreases.

And unless\\nall firms could somehow agree on a common\\ntranslation formula for indexing purposes,\\nnominal demand shocks would produce a\\nwide dispersion of unwarranted changes in\\nrelative wages.

There are several reasons why this is\\nso. In the first place, in the new classical\\nmodel it is not the expectational element\\nthat generates aggregate nominal wage flexi-\\nbility. Rather, a prompt response of aggre-\\ngate nominal wages to nominal shocks is\\nguaranteed by the perfect ex ante flexibility\\nof relative wages in auction markets.

In the auc-\\ntion-market model, workers or groups of\\nworkers are willing to accept lower wages in\\nthe face of excess supply even when errors in\\nexpectations lead them to misperceive the\\nentire wage cut as a relative one. In the event\\nof such misperceptions, some labor supply is\\nwithdrawn but nominal wages still fall. And\\nas soon as the misperception is corrected,\\nwages quickly fall by the remaining amount\\nnecessary to eliminate excess labor supply\\nand clear labor markets. In the world of\\nimplicit contracts I have described earlier,\\nhowever, the absence of substantial relative\\nwage flexibility eliminates this basis for\\nprompt nominal wage flexibility.\\nIn the absence of auction markets with\\ntheir relative wage flexibility, the achieve-\\nment of aggregate nominal wage flexibility\\nbecomes a prisoner\\'s dilemma problem. But,\\nsince wages are not completely rigid under\\nimplicit contracts, it is not possible that indi-\\nvidual firms and their workers forecast the\\nultimate equilibrium response of average\\nwages to nominal shocks, promptly adjust\\ntheir own wages to it and thereby solve the\\nprisoner\\'s dilemma in favor of nominal wage\\nflexibility? I think not. Two key features of\\nimplicit contracts interact with one central\\nfeature of rational forecasts to reduce sharply\\nthe feasibility of commonly shared expecta-\\ntions about the equilibrium W as a surrogate\\nfor Arrow-Debreu contingent claims con-\\ntracts. First, firms are wage setters, not wage\\ntakers; second, frequent haggling over wage\\nchanges is very costly to the development of\\nmutually beneficial long-term relationships\\nbetween workers and firms; and third, fore-\\ncasts of equilibrium wage and price levels are\\nsubject to substantial stochastic error and\\nforecast outcomes are likely to be widely\\ndistributed over the population of wage-set-\\nting firms.\\nIn a world of auction markets, the fact\\nthat forecasts of individual agents are widely\\ndistributed around the \"true\" mean is for\\nmost purposes irrelevant. In his seminal\\narticle (1961), John Muth pointed out that\\ncross-sectional differences in expectations\\nposed no problem for the theory because\\ntheir aggregate effect would be negligible so\\nlong as deviations from the rational forecast\\nby individual firms were not strongly corre-\\nlated with each other. In auction markets,\\nspecific prices or wages are not determined\\nby individual forecasts. But, in a world of\\nimplicit contracts with firms as wage setters,\\nthey would be.

In the first place,\\ngiven the large room for disagreements about\\nthe forecast, we have to rule out on moral\\nhazard grounds implicit contracts under\\nwhich workers, prior to actually observing\\na deterioration in employment conditions,\\nwould accept employer forecasts of a declin-\\ning equilibrium nominal wage as the basis\\nfor a downward wage adjustment.

The major gains, in terms of higher\\nemployment, that came from lowering wages\\nin the face of downward aggregate demand\\nshocks do not accrue to particular workers in\\nparticular firms as the result of their own\\nactions. Rather, the gains accrue through the\\neffect of generalized lower wages in reducing\\nprices, raising real money balances and\\nthereby increasing aggregate demand. Once\\nthe assumption of flexible auction markets\\nand a competitive bidding down of wages by\\nindividual workers is abandoned, it is no\\nlonger valid to level against sticky-wage the-\\nories the charge that they imply an irrational\\nfailure on the part of economic agents to\\npursue unexploited gains from trade. Without\\nthe Walrasian auctioneer, the individual firms\\nin an economy are, as noted earlier, in a\\nprisoner's dilemma. The large comparative\\nstatics gain from an aggregate nominal wage\\ncut does not translate into such a gain seen\\nfrom the point of view of individual firms.'0\\nThe potential gain they see is the one that\\nwould accrue from making a relative change.\\nThey will indeed make such changes, but\\nslowly and cautiously, acting under the con-\\nstraints on relative changes spelled out\\nearlier.11 Only as the perceived long-term\\nlevel of W falls will the situation be differ-\\nent.\\nSince what is important for nominal wage\\nadjustment is the perceived level of W, ex-\\npectations about its future value will, of\\ncourse, be relevant. Within the constraints\\nimposed by implicit contracts, wages in indi-\\nvidual firms have to be adjusted to deal with\\nchanging conditions. Since wage changes are\\ndifficult and impose strains on long-term re-\\nlationships, the wage once set has to last for\\na while, typically at least a year (and under\\nunion contracts often longer). The expecta-\\ntions that workers and employers have about\\nthe future course of average wages and prices\\nwill therefore exert an important influence\\nover the current wage decision. I do not want\\nhere to join the controversy over the extent\\nto which wage setting is backward or for-\\nward looking. But what is central to my\\nmessage is that the relevant forecast does not\\nassume prompt adjustment to a new equi-\\nlibrium wage but rather the more hesitant\\nand gradual process described above.\\nThe appropriate framework for analyzing\\nthe aggregate behavior of wages, therefore, is\\nnot one in which certain macroeconomic im-\\nperfections-information gaps or mispercep-\\ntions about the general wage and price level\\n-prevent the market-clearing adjustment of\\nwages, which themselves are perfectly flexi-\\nble in the face of relative disturbances. The\\nessence of the behavior of wages in response\\nto aggregate demand shocks is just the op-\\nposite. Macroeconomic shocks break through\\nthe short-run stickiness of wages and prices\\nin the face of relative disturbances to pro-\\nduce the aggregate adjustments, albeit slow\\nand gradual ones, that we do in fact observe.\\nThere is a nice paradox in all of this.

The private re-\\nturns from specific customer-supplier and\\nworker-firm attachment shrink relative to the\\nreturns from making appropriate adjust-\\nments to changes in tastes, technology, and\\nother external developments. The rationally\\nbased barriers to market clearing crumble.\\nWe economists are indeed correct to insist on\\nthe long-run efficacy of markets and the util-\\nity of the market clearing paradigm as a way\\nof explaining long-term market allocations.\\nBut we need not abandon the premise of the\\nrational maximizing calculus in order to ex-\\nplain the structural stickiness of wages and\\nprices and the failure of markets to clear in\\nthe short run. Both phenomena-long-run\\nmarket clearing and short-run stickiness-\\nultimately derive from the same rational\\naspects of human behavior.\\nSome of the consequences of this recog-\\nnition are nevertheless very troubling for\\neconomic theory and theoretically informed\\nempirical research. In the new classical eco-\\nnomics, there is no need for empirical re-\\nsearch to determine how wages and prices\\nrespond to demand shocks, given expecta-\\ntions about the general price level. Pure\\ntheory-the auction-market model-dictates\\nhow prices and wages behave. Empirical re-\\nsearch is needed principally to tell us some-\\nthing about the formation of expectations on\\nthe general price level.\\nWhile contract theory and related research\\nhas been developing rationally based founda-\\ntions for structural wage and price stickiness,\\nthe work to date is essentially in the form of\\nexistence theorems. That is, it tells us why\\nsticky wages are consistent with the rational\\ncalculus. But it does not give us a theoretical\\nbasis for specifying the two basic compo-\\nnents of macro wage adjustment: What\\n\"laws\" do firms follow, under implicit con-\\ntracts, in adjusting their wages, assuming the\\nstability of W, the wage norm? And what\\ndoes it take to produce a perceived \"perma-\\nnent\" change in that norm?\\nA full and complete microeconomic foun-\\ndation to wage adjustment with the power of\\nthe auction-market model may never be\\nforthcoming. If that is so, we may have to\\nlook to regularities derived from macroeco-\\nnomic empirical research to infer microeco-\\nnomic behavior. But this raises another set of\\nproblems. While forward-looking expecta-\\ntions play much less of a role in the macro\\nwage adjustment process I have outlined,\\nthey are not completely absent in forming\\nperceptions about the wage norm.

In\\npublic choice, we can perhaps explain after\\nthe event whose interest was served by a\\nparticular decision, but we need political sci-\\nence to be able to forecast which interest is\\nlikely to be served, whether that of the execu-\\ntive, the legislature, the bureaucracy, some\\npressure group-and which pressure group\\nor, in the odd instance, the voters.

We\\ngo beyond this simple statement today in\\nsaying that nations are groups of people with\\ncommon tastes in public goods (Richard\\nCooper, 1977). Geography discriminates be-\\ntween countries, as a hypothetical customs\\nunion between Iceland and New Zealand\\nwould demonstrate, and so do governments.\\nBehind and alongside of governments, peo-\\nple discriminate.\\nPublic goods, let me remind you, are that\\nclass of goods like public works where exclu-\\nsion of consumers may be impossible, but in\\nany event consumption of the good by one\\nconsuming unit-short of some level ap-\\nproaching congestion-does not exhaust its\\navailability for others. They are typically\\nunderproduced-not, I believe, for the Gal-\\nbraithian reason that private goods are ad-\\nvertized and public goods are not-but be-\\ncause the consumer who has access to the\\ngood anyhow has little reason to vote the\\ntaxes, or pay his or her appropriate share.\\nUnless the consumer is a highly moral per-\\nson, following the Kantian Categorical Im-\\nperative of acting in ways which can be\\ngeneralized, he or she is apt to be a \"free\\nrider.\" The tendency for public goods to be\\nunderproduced is serious enough within a\\nnation bound by some sort of social con-\\ntract, and directed in public matters by a\\ngovernment with the power to impose and\\ncollect taxes. It is, I propose to argue in due\\ncourse, a more serious problem in interna-\\ntional political and economic relations in the\\nabsence of international government.\\nAdam Smith\\'s list of public goods was\\nlimited to national defense, law and order,\\nand public works that it would not pay indi-\\nviduals to produce for themselves. Most\\neconomists are prepared now to extend the\\nlist to include stabilization, regulation, and\\nincome redistribution (Cooper, 1977), even\\nnationalism (Albert Breton, 1964), and stan-\\ndards that reduce transaction costs, includ-\\ning weights and measures, language, and\\nmoney. Public goods were popular a decade\\nago. There is something of a tendency today,\\nat least in political science, to draw back and\\nclaim that such institutions as open world\\nmarkets are not public goods because coun-\\ntries can be excluded from them by dis-\\ncrimination. One monetarist goes so far as to\\nmaintain that money is not a public good,\\narguing, I believe, from the store-of-value\\nfunction where possession by one individual\\ndenies possession by others, rather than from\\nthe unit-of-account function in which exclu-\\nsion is impossible and exhaustion does not\\nhold (Roland Vaubel, 1984).\\nII\\nBefore addressing international public\\ngoods, I want to digress to suggest that there\\nare other limits to the imperialist claims of\\neconomics. Social goods are not traded in\\nmarkets, for example-honor, respect, dig-\\nnity, love. In his address to the Columbia\\nUniversity Bicentennial Assembly, Sir Den-\\nnis Robertson asserted that what economists\\neconomize is love (1955, pp. 5-6). Michael\\nWalzer (1983, pp. 101-02) has compiled a\\nlist of \" things\" that contemporary moral\\nphilosophy will not tolerate being bought\\nand sold: human beings, political power,\\ncriminal justice, freedom of expression, mar-\\nriage and procreation rights (pace Becker),\\nthe right to leave the political community,\\nexemptions from military service and jury\\nduty, political office, basic services like po-\\nlice protection, desperate exchanges such as\\npermission for women and children to\\nwork fourteen hours a day, prizes and honors,\\nlove and friendship, criminally noxious sub-\\nstances such as heroin. The inclusion of a\\nnumber of items on the list is debatable, and\\nhistory reveals that most of them have been\\ntraded on occasion in some cultures. The\\nmarket, moreover, strikes two lawyers as a\\ndubious device for making \"tragic choices,\"\\nlike those in which scarcity confronts human-\\nistic moral values, for example, allocating\\nfood in famine, children available for adop-\\ntion, or organ transplants (Guido Calabrese\\nand Philip Bobbit, 1978). It is difficult to\\ndissent from Walzers\\'s conclusion that a\\nradically laissez-faire economy would be like\\na totalitarian state, treating every social good\\nas if it were a commodity (1983, p. 119).\\nThere is, moreover, a similar remark from a\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Economists are reluctant to\\ndepend on self-denial to any degree (Ken-\\nneth Arrow, 1975, p. 22), and moral phil-\\nosophers are not far behind. To a modern\\nstudent of ethics, James Fishkin (1982, ch.\\nii), obligations to others fall into three cate-\\ngories: minimal altruism, where the benefit\\nto the receiver is substantial and the cost\\nto the altruist low-the acts of a cheap\\nSamaritan; acts of heroic sacrifice that are\\nnot called for; and a robust zone of indif-\\nference where one has no cause to be con-\\ncerned over the effects of one\\'s acts on others.\\nThis is for positive actions. Acts that harm\\nothers are proscribed by the Golden Rule.\\nAdam Smith expressed the same viewpoint\\nforcefully: \" Every man is, no doubt, by na-\\nture first and principally recommended to his\\nown care\" (1759 (1808), I, p. 193), but goes\\non: \"Although the ruin of our neighbour\\nmay affect us less than a very small misfor-\\ntune of our own, we must not ruin him to\\nprevent that small misfortune, or even to\\nprevent our own ruin\" (ibid., p. 194). Does\\nthis prohibit us from playing zero-sum games\\nor negative non-zero-sum games? In interna-\\ntional trade, must we refrain from levying\\nthe optimum tariff? The optimum tariff works\\nto self-interest mainly in the absence of re-\\ntaliation, and if Adam Smith excludes hurt-\\ning our neighbor, he recognizes that \"as ev-\\nery man doth, so shall it be done to him, and\\nretaliation seems to be the great law of na-\\nture\" (ibid., p. 191).\\nNote parenthetically that today\\'s moral\\nphilosophers cover a wide territory either\\nside of Fishkin, from Peter Singer (1972) at\\none extreme whose criterion of justice re-\\nquires successive acts of altruism until the\\nwelfare of the recipient has risen to that of\\nthe giver which has fallen, to Robert Nozick\\n(1974) at the other who believes that self-in-\\nterest rules out altruism almost altogether.\\nIII\\nSelf-interest then is legitimate over a large\\nzone of indifference provided that justice\\nis served by our not hurting others. But\\nthe robust zone of indifference applies to\\nstrangers, and not to those with whom we\\nhave a special relationship, sharing collective\\ngoods. It does not apply in the family, the\\nneighborhood, in clubs, in the tribe, racial or\\nreligious group, or in the nation. There is\\nsome uncertainty whether it applies in re-\\ngions within a country-New England, the\\nWest, the South-or to arrangements be-\\ntween countries short of the world level such\\nas North America or the European Common\\nMarket. Collective goods involved here are\\ndistributed by mechanisms different from the\\nmarket: gifts, grants, unequal exchange,\\nsharing through a budget according to\\nneed, interest-free loans, inheritance, dowries,\\nalimony, and the like all have a place.\\nMembership in these groups is decided in\\nvarious ways: by birth, by choice-as in\\nmoving into a certain neighborhood or\\nmigrating between countries, by application\\nfor admission and acceptance. Walzer de-\\nfends the right of countries to keep out\\nwould-be immigrants motivated by economic\\nself-interest, but not those subjected to\\npersecution: \"The primary good that we\\ndistribute to one another is membership in\\nsome community\" (1981; 1983, ch. ii, p. 1).\\nHe argues, however, that states lack the right\\nto keep members from emigrating if there is\\nsome other community ready to take them\\nin. Clubs discriminate against outsiders.\\nNeighborhoods are more complex, being pre-\\nsumably open to anyone able to afford and\\nfind a place to live, but, in sociological real-\\nity, often exhibiting tendencies to attract their\\nown kind and repel others, including harass-\\nment or unwritten or even legal restrictions\\nagainst property ownership.

Adam Smith\\nminimizes the difference between families and\\nstrangers, suggesting that affection is little\\nmore than habitual sympathy produced by\\npropinquity; despite the greater thickness of\\nblood than water, he claims that siblings\\neducated at distances from one another expe-\\nrience a diminution of affection (1759 (1808)\\nII, pp. 68-70).

Patinkin chided me privately\\nfor this interpretation, and it is admittedly\\noversimplified. But the difference between\\nthe Johnson and the Patinkin positions, both\\nemanating from Chicago, suggests the line\\nbetween market and nonmarket areas in eco-\\nnomics is shadowy.\\nIn writing about the multinational corpo-\\nration, I have from time to time suggested\\nthat host countries resist the intrusion of\\nstrangers because \"...man in his elemental\\nstate is a peasant with a possessive love of\\nhis own turf; a mercantilist who favors ex-\\nports over imports; a Populist who distrusts\\nbanks, especially foreign banks; a mo-\\nnopolist who abhors competition; a xen-\\nophobe who feels threatened by strangers\\nand foreigners\" (1984, p. 39), usually adding\\nthat it is the task of international economics\\nto extirpate these primitive instincts and to\\nteach cosmopolitanism. The fact that some\\nof these reactions remain at a late stage in\\nthe educational process can be tested by the\\ndevice of asking students on examinations,\\nseriatim, a series of questions:\\nDo you advocate free trade, or at least is\\nthere a strong presumption in its favor?\\nDo you advocate the free international\\nmovement of portfolio capital?\\n... of corporate capital in foreign direct\\ninvestment?\\n... free migration of students and pro-\\nfessional labor?\\n... immigration of relatives of persons\\npermanently resident in this country?\\n... free migration for all?\\n(It is desirable to feed these questions to the\\nvictims one at a time, without revealing the\\nwhole list before the first answer is given,\\nand to take up the replies to the first ques-\\ntions so that there is no chance to go back\\nand amend early answers.)

In\\nneither case is the discontinuity in mobility\\nexplained. Perhaps something is owed to low\\ntransport costs, but additionally, factor mo-\\nbility requires a group with such strong so-\\ncial cohesion that those moving are willing to\\nshift, and those at the receiving end are\\ncontent to receive them.\\nRonald McKinnon (1963) offered a differ-\\nent criterion: an optimum currency area was\\none that traded intensively at home, but only\\nto a limited extent abroad. This implied that\\ntastes within a country are homogeneous for\\ntraded goods (as well as for public goods),\\nand that regionally specialized production\\nhad grown up to serve those tastes. The\\nMundell and McKinnon criteria do not nec-\\nessarily converge: on Mundell\\'s standard,\\nCanada is too big to be an optimum cur-\\nrency area, because of limited movement be-\\ntween Quebec and the English-speaking parts\\nof Canada, and the comparative isolation of\\nthe Maritimes and Vancouver.

Some years ago, Seymour Harris (1952)\\nwrote a book on New England in which he\\nclaimed that the area got a raw deal from the\\nrest of the country because it paid more in\\ntaxes to the federal government than it re-\\nceived in federal expenditure. This thesis im-\\nplicitly violated the distinction between a\\nbudget and a market: in a market equal\\nvalues are exchanged. A budget, on the other\\nhand, is a device expressing the cohesion of a\\nsharing group with monies raised according\\nto one standard, perhaps ability to pay, and\\nexpenditure distributed according to another,\\nsome combination of efficiency and need.\\nThe other example, equally shocking to an\\ninternational trade economist, was the no-\\ntion of the juste retour, or fair return, pro-\\npounded by France in connection with ex-\\npenditure for joint projects in Europe. France\\ninsisted that all monies contributed by her be\\nspent in France.

Among the more audacious\\neconomists producing an economic theory or\\nset of theories on war is Walt Rostow (1960,\\npp. 108 ff.).

Those that have\\ninterested me especially in a study of the\\n1929 depression and other financial and eco-\\nnomic crises have been trading systems, in-\\nternational money, capital flows, consistent\\nmacroeconomic policies in periods of tran-\\nquility, and a source of crisis management\\nwhen needed. By the last I mean the mainte-\\nnance of open markets in glut and a source\\nof supplies in acute shortage, plus a lender of\\nlast resort in acute financial crisis (see my\\n1973 book, revised 1986, forthcoming).\\nPublic goods are produced domestically by\\ngovernment, unless the governmental agenda\\nis blocked in stalemate among competing\\ndistributional coalitions as described by\\nMancur Olson (1982). Voluntary provision\\nof public goods is plagued by the free rider.\\nIn the international sphere where there is no\\nworld government, the question remains how\\npublic goods are produced. Ralph Bryant is\\none of the few economists who has discussed\\nthe public good element in international co-\\noperation. His vocabulary is different from\\nthat of the political scientists: their \"regimes\"\\nare his \"supranational traffic regulations\"\\n(1980, p. 470), and he expects leadership in\\ncooperation in monetary and fiscal policy\\nfrom supranational institutions such as the\\nInternational Monetary Fund (p. 481). I find\\nthis doubtful on the basis of the interwar\\nrecord of such institutions as the League of\\nNations.\\nPolitical science in this field has produced\\ntwo schools: the realists who hold to a na-\\ntional-interest theory of international politics,\\nand the moralists, whom Robert Keohane\\nprefers to call \"institutionalists\" (1984, p. 7).\\nRealists maintain that international public\\ngoods are produced, if at all, by the leading\\npower, a so-called \" hegemon,\" that is willing\\nto bear an undue part of the short-run costs\\nof these goods, either because it regards itself\\nas gaining in the long run, because it is paid\\nin a different coin such as prestige, glory,\\nimmortality, or some combination of the two.\\nInstitutionalists recognize that hegemonic\\nleaders emerge from time to time in the\\nworld economy and typically set in motion\\nhabits of international cooperation, called\\n\"regimes,\" which consist of \"principles,\\nnorms, rules and decision-making procedures\\naround which the expectations of interna-\\ntional actors converge in given issue areas\"\\n(Stephen Krasner, 1983, p. 1). Under British\\nhegemony, the regimes of free trade and the\\ngold standard developed more or less un-\\nconsciously. With subsequent American\\nhegemony, a more purposeful process of in-\\nstitution making was undertaken, with agree-\\nments at Bretton Woods, on tariffs and trade,\\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation\\nand Development, and the like. Political sci-\\nentists recognize that regimes are more read-\\nily maintained than established since margin-\\nal costs are below average costs; as hegemonic\\nperiods come to an end with the waning of\\nthe leading country\\'s economic vitality, new\\nregimes needed to meet new problems are\\ndifficult to create. Cooper (1985) has written\\nof the eighty years it took to create and get\\nfunctioning the World Health Organization\\ndespite the clear benefits to all countries\\nfrom controlling the spread of disease. And\\nit takes work to maintain regimes; in the\\nabsence of infusions of attention and money,\\nthey tend in the long run to decay.\\nI originally suggested that the 1929 depres-\\nsion was allowed to run unchecked because\\nthere was no leading country able and will-\\ning to take responsibility for crisis manage-\\nment, halting beggar-thy-neighbor policies\\nfrom 1930, and especially acting as a lender\\nof last resort to prevent the serious run on\\nthe Creditanstalt in May 1931 spreading, as\\nit did, to Germany, Britain, Japan, the United\\nStates, and ultimately to the gold bloc. Brit-\\nain, the leading economic power of the nine-\\nteenth century, was unable to halt the run;\\nthe United States, which might have had the\\nability, possibly assisted by France, was un-\\nwilling. This view has been rejected by one\\neconomic historian who holds that the trou-\\nbles of the interwar period were more\\ndeep-seated, and that what was needed was\\nmore fundamental therapy than maintaining\\nopen markets and providing a lender of last\\nresort, something, that is, akin to the heroic\\npublic good after World War II, the Marshall\\nPlan (D.

I conclude that the existence of an\\ninternational lender of last resort made the\\nfinancial crises of 1825, 1836, 1847, 1866,\\nand 1907 more or less ephemeral, like summer\\nstorms, whereas its absence in 1873, 1890,\\nand 1929 produced deep depressions-short-\\nened in the 1890 case by the deus ex machina\\nof gold production from the Rand. Again\\nthere is room for disagreement.\\nThe point of all this is that after about\\n1971, the United States, like Britain from\\nabout 1890, has shrunk in economic might\\nrelative to the world as a whole, and more\\nimportantly, has lost the appetite for provid-\\ning international economic public goods-\\nopen markets in times of glut, supplies in\\ntimes of acute shortage, steady flows of\\ncapital to developing countries, international\\nmoney, coordination of macroeconomic pol-\\nicy and last-resort lending.

In reading\\nrecent books on macroeconomic policy by\\nleading governmental economists under both\\nDemocratic and Republican administrations,\\nthe late Arthur Okun (1981) and Herbert\\nStein (1984), I have been struck by how little\\nattention the authors paid to international\\nrepercussions.

There has been\\na recent upsurge of interest in the interna-\\ntional dimension because of the connections\\namong the federal deficit, the exchange rate\\nfor the dollar, and the balance-of-payments\\ndeficit, but the focus of this interest is almost\\nexclusively on what the connections mean\\nfor U.S. interest rates, industrial policy,\\ngrowth, and wealth. The international im-\\npact is largely ignored, bearing out the truth\\nin former German Chancellor Helmut\\nSchmidt\\'s statement that \"the United States\\nseems completely unconscious of the eco-\\nnomic efforts of its policies on the Alliance\"\\n(1984, p. 27).\\nSome of the discussion of international\\nregimes by political scientists verges on what\\nmy teacher, Wesley Clair Mitchell, used to\\ncall \"implicit theorizing,\" that is, convenient\\nad hoc theoretical explanations to fit given\\nfacts that lack generality. Charles Lipson\\n(1985), for example, suggested that the slip-\\npage in U.S. hegemony in the 1970\\'s resulted\\nin a loss of the international public good of\\nsecure property rights and therefore in the\\nwidespread nationalization of foreign direct\\ninvestment. He went on to say that the rea-\\nson less developed countries (LDCs) did not\\ndefault on their debts to bank syndicates was\\nthat bank lending was \"better institutional-\\nized,\" \"a smaller group,\" \"better protected\\nby legal remedies\" (pp. 136, 158, 170). He\\nwas surprised that the decline of British\\nhegemony in the interwar period did not\\nresult in more LDC aggression against for-\\neign property (p. 191), but failed to observe\\nthe widespread default on foreign bonds in\\nthe 1930\\'s, despite the organization of inter-\\nnational finance. In my judgement Keohane\\nexaggerates the efficacy and importance of\\nthe international regime in oil that was\\nformed after the first OPEC oil shock of\\n1973 (see his ch. 10). The crisis caused by the\\nYom Kippur embargo of the Netherlands\\nwas to my mind shockingly mishandled by\\ngovernments, and the public good of crisis\\nmanagement was left to the private multina-\\ntional oil companies. The formation of the\\nInternational Energy Agency was a classic\\noperation in locking the barn door after the\\nhorse had been stolen.\\nBetween national self-interest and the pro-\\nvision of international public goods, there is\\nan intermediate position: indifference to\\nboth. An interesting contrast has been ob-\\nserved in the 1930\\'s between Britain which\\nforced Argentina into a bilateral payments\\nagreement (the Roca-Runciman Agreement\\nof 1933) in order to take advantage of its\\nmonopsony position, and the United States\\nthat had a similar opportunity vis-a-vis Brazil\\nbut ignored it (Marcelo de Paiva Abreu,\\n1984).\\nIt is fairly clear from the historical record\\nthat economic hegemony runs down in decay\\n-in the British case after 1913 and the\\nUnited States about 1971-leading Felix\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The nostalgia is only partly a re-\\nsult of faulty memories. It\\'s not hard to\\nbe satisfied with economists and policy\\nprocesses when the economy is growing, pro-\\nductivity marches steadily upward, and even\\nthe national debt is obligingly declining in\\nrelative importance. It\\'s much harder when\\nproductivity growth plummets for reasons\\nthat no one honestly purports fully to under-\\nstand, expectations of public and private\\nconsumers have to be cut back to fit with\\nslower income growth, and inflation and in-\\nterest rates are bouncing around at un-\\nfamiliar levels.\\nAdjusting to the energy shocks and slower\\ngrowth that began in the 1970\\'s strained the\\neconomic policy processes of all industrial\\ncountries and made the participants feel\\nfrustrated and inadequate. It\\'s not obvious,\\neven with hindsight, that the fundamental\\ndifficulties facing the industrial world in the\\n1970\\'s can credibly be blamed on economists\\nor any particular structure of government\\nor economic policy responses, but all came\\nin for their share of the understandable\\nhostility.\\nThe difficulties of the U.S. economy in the\\n1980\\'s, by contrast, revolve heavily around\\nan economic policy mistake: the creation of\\na large structural deficit in the federal budget.\\nI do not believe that the structure of our\\neconomic decision process was the cause of\\nthe mistake. Blaming the deficit on inherent\\nflaws in the policy process requires an ex-\\nplanation of why the process did not cause\\nsimilar mistakes in the past. But the events\\nof 1981 which produced the deficit illustrate\\nseveral of the difficulties of economic pol-\\nicymaking which make mistakes harder to\\navoid:\\nthe uncertainty of macroeconomic fore-\\ncasting;\\nthe isolation of monetary and fiscal\\npolicy;\\nthe contentiousness of economists and\\ntheir tendency to let their ideological posi-\\ntions cloud their judgments about the\\nlikely effects of particular policies.\\nThat a tax cut unmatched by comparable\\nspending cuts would produce a deficit should\\nhave surprised no economist. That the deficit\\nwas so large reflected both economic and\\npolitical miscalculations. The Reagan Ad-\\nministration has been faulted for masking\\nthe deficit with a \"rosy scenario,\" but the\\nfact is that most of the forecasting commun-\\nity, including the Congressional Budget\\nOffice, expected positive real growth in the\\neconomy. The administration\\'s official fore-\\ncast differed from the rest only in its degree\\nof optimism. Forecasters in and out of\\ngovernment were oversanguine about growth\\nlargely because they failed to realize how\\nserious the Federal Reserve was about rein-\\ning in the money supply to control inflation.\\nThe Fed was not defying the administration,\\nwhich was touting the efficacy of monetary\\nstringency for controlling inflation, but hard-\\nly anyone seemed to remember that the way\\ntight money controls inflation is by slowing\\neconomic activity. Moreover, as our Associa-\\ntion\\'s President-elect, Robert Eisner, has\\npointed out (1986, p. 146), the economics\\ncommunity, unfamiliar with a world of high\\ninflation rates, overestimated the stimulative\\neffect of the existing deficit. Added to this\\nwas the enthusiasm of the ideological propo-\\nnents of smaller government, some of whom\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The size of\\nthe deficits was also masked by the assump-\\ntion of unspecified future spending cuts, an\\nassumption reflecting the view that the U.S.\\ngovernment was operating a lot of wasteful\\nprograms with little public support which\\nCongress could soon be persuaded to reduce\\nor eliminate.\\nBoth in the administration and in Con-\\ngress, decisions were made at a breakneck\\npace, in a highly charged political atmo-\\nsphere, amid conflicting claims and compet-\\ning forecasts, with little attention to the con-\\nsistency of monetary and fiscal policy and\\nmostly by people with little experience in\\nevaluating the reasonableness of any set of\\neconomic estimates. (See David Stockman,\\n1986, ch. 3.) When the dust settled, we found\\nourselves with a serious recession that\\nnobody expected, and an escalating struc-\\ntural budget deficit that nobody wanted. It\\nwas hardly economic policy\\'s finest hour.\\nThe agonizing-and so far only partially\\nsuccessful- struggle to correct the mistakes\\nof 1981 have kept the economic policy pro-\\ncess under stress and have continued to\\ndramatize some of its weakest aspects. The\\nstruggle between the president and the Con-\\ngress over deficit solutions illustrates the\\nprice we pay for the separation of powers.\\nThe fact that fiscal policy has become an\\nexercise in damage control, while the Federal\\nReserve makes all the important decisions\\nabout the economy, underlines the sep-\\naration of monetary and fiscal policy. The\\nsensitivity of deficits to the pace of the econ-\\nomy advertises the unreliability of macroeco-\\nnomic forecasts. The fact that all the actions\\nthat could be taken to correct the deficit are\\nunpleasant ones drags out the annual agony\\nof budget setting interminably and drama-\\ntizes how layered and cumbersome it has\\nbecome.\\nSmall wonder that the strains of the last\\nfew years, with a little help from the press,\\nhave reinforced the negative stereotypes that\\neconomists and political decision makers\\nhave of each other. Political decision makers\\nsee economists as quarrelsome folks who\\ncannot forecast, cannot agree, cannot ex-\\npress themselves clearly, and have strong\\nideological biases. Economists return the\\nfavor by regarding politicians as short-\\nsighted, interested only in what is popular\\nwith the electorate, and unwilling to face\\nhard decisions. All of the stereotypes are\\npartly right.\\nPoliticians embody their stereotype in\\neconomist jokes. Economists have retaliated\\nmore massively by applying the tools of their\\ntrade to the political system itself. Public\\nchoice theory essentially asks the question:\\nwhat would economic policy be like if our\\nstereotype of politicians were entirely true?\\nThe answer provides considerable insight\\ninto observed political behavior and cer-\\ntainly helps explain why the idealistic econo-\\nmist so often fails to find the system simulat-\\ning the public interest motivation of the\\nphilosopher queen.\\nIII. Some Drastic Nonsolutions\\nWidespread concern that the economic\\npolicy process is not working well has\\nspawned proposals for drastic change that\\nmove in two quite different directions: one\\ntoward circumscribing the discretion of\\nelected officials by putting economic policy\\non automatic pilot and the other toward\\nmaking elected officials more directly re-\\nsponsible to the voters for their policies.\\nThe automatic pilot approach \\'flows from\\nthe perspective of public choice theory that\\nthe decisions of democratically elected of-\\nficials interested in staying in office cannot\\nbe counted on to produce economic policy\\nin the social interest, but are likely to be\\nbiased toward excessive government spend-\\ning, growing deficits, special interest tax and\\nspending programs, and easier money. A\\nway to overcome these biases is to agree in\\nadvance on strict rules of economic policy,\\nsuch as a fixed monetary growth path or\\nconstitutionally required balance in the\\nfederal budget.\\nEven if one accepts the premises, however,\\nfirm rules are hard to define in a rapidly\\nchanging world -no one seems to know what\\n\"money\" is anymore-and can easily lead\\nto perverse results. Recent experience with\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"trying to reduce the federal deficit along\\nthe fixed path specified by the Gramm-Rud-\\nman-Hollings amendment, for example, has\\ngiven us a taste of some of the possible\\ndisadvantages of a balanced budget rule.\\nThere is danger that specific dollar targets\\nfor the deficit will require procyclical fiscal\\npolicy, perhaps precipitating a recession that\\nwould then make budget balance even less\\nattainable. Moreover, the effort to reach the\\ntargets can induce cosmetic or self-defeating\\nmeasures, such as moving spending from one\\nfiscal year to another for no valid reason,\\nselling assets to reduce a current deficit while\\nexacerbating future ones, and accomplishing\\ndesired purposes by regulatory or other non-\\nbudgetary means.\\nThe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings experience,\\nhowever, has suggested the usefulness of a\\ndifferent approach to deficit reduction than a\\nbalanced budget rule; namely, a deficit neu-\\ntral amendment rule. If legislators advocat-\\ning a tax preference are required to propose\\na rate increase to pay for it, special interest\\ntax legislation may falter. Similarly, the re-\\nquirement that a proposal for additional\\nspending be accompanied by a simultaneous\\nproposal to raise taxes or reduce another\\nspending program may be an effective brake\\non deficits.\\nThe other direction of reform reflects the\\ncontrasting view that the separation of\\npowers and the diffusion of responsibility in\\nour government make it too difficult for the\\nelectorate to enforce its will by holding offi-\\ncials responsible for their policies. The\\npotential for deadlock would be reduced if\\nthe United States moved toward a parlia-\\nmentary system, or found a way to hold\\npolitical parties more strictly accountable for\\nproposing or carrying out identifiable poli-\\ncies.\\nCasual examination of parliamentary de-\\nmocracies, such as the Untied Kingdom and\\nSweden, does not provide striking evidence\\nof the superiority of parliamentary systems\\nfor making economic choices, even if one did\\nnot have two hundred years of tradition to\\ncontend with in changing our system. The\\nmore modest notion that our system would\\nwork more smoothly if political parties had\\nbetter defined positions and disciplined their\\nelected members more strictly may well be\\nright, but seems to fly in the face of current\\nhistory. Voters are showing less strong party\\naffiliation and more inclination to choose for\\nthemselves among candidates, while mem-\\nbers of Congress tend increasingly to be\\npragmatists willing to work out nonideologi-\\ncal compromises across party lines. These\\ntrends seem likely to be the irreversible con-\\nsequences of greater education, sophistica-\\ntion, and exposure to public issues among\\nvoters and elected officials alike and to make\\na resurgence of party discipline and loyalty\\nunrealistic.\\nIV. Making the Economic Policy System\\nWork Better\\nMy own proposals involve less drastic\\nchanges in the structure of our government.\\nThey reflect a strong faith in the ability of\\ninformed citizens and their elected repre-\\nsentatives to make policy decisions for the\\ncommon good, even to make substantial\\nsacrifices and take political risks to further\\nwhat they perceive as the long-run national\\ninterest-once they understand what the\\nchoices are. I also believe that the separation\\nof powers between the executive and legisla-\\ntive branches works pretty well most of the\\ntime. It provides needed protection against\\noverzealousness in either branch, albeit at\\nsome risk of occasional stalemate.\\nThe main problem, it seems to me, is that\\nour economic policy system has gradually\\nbecome so complex, diffused, and frag-\\nmented that it impedes rather than fosters\\ninformed choices on major issues. The frag-\\nmentation imposes two kinds of costs. First,\\nit makes the decision process itself exceed-\\ningly inefficient. Decisions are made too\\noften, in too great detail, and reviewed by\\ntoo many layers of decision makers in the\\nexecutive branch and in Congress. Too much\\ntime is absorbed in procedure and in wran-\\ngling over details, not enough on major deci-\\nsions. It's time to simplify the process, to\\nweed out some of the institutions, and to tip\\nthe balance between substance and process\\nback toward substance.\\nSecond, decisions are made separately that\\nought to be made together, or at least with\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

       " 'attention to their impact on each other. The\\nseparation of monetary and fiscal policy is\\none example; the separation of tax and\\nspending decisions is another. Congress has\\nmade a good deal of progress in recent years\\nin putting spending decisions together with\\ntheir revenue or deficit consequences, but\\nmore could be done. I have seven steps to\\nsuggest that might make the economic policy\\nprocess work more effectively.\\nFirst, seek out decisions that should be\\nmade less frequently and arrange to do so.\\nThis would economize decision-making time\\nand enhance the chances of thoughtful,\\nwell-informed decisions. It would free up\\ntime and energy for managing the govern-\\nment enterprise more effectively, with a\\nlonger planning horizon. It would also re-\\nduce the inefficiency and sense of unfairness\\nthat goes with frequent changes of the rules.\\nMaking the federal budget every other year\\nwould be a major advance. Major revisions\\nof the tax code should occur even less fre-\\nquently. Big ticket acquisitions, such as major\\nweapons systems, should be reviewed thor-\\noughly at infrequent intervals and then put\\non a steady efficient track, not constantly\\nrevisited.\\nWith a two-year budget, there would occa-\\nsionally be major events, such as a sudden\\nescalation of international tension or a sharp\\nunexpected shift in the economic outlook,\\nthat would justify reopening the budget in\\nmidstream, but the temptation to tinker fre-\\nquently should be strongly resisted. The\\nargument that economists cannot forecast\\naccurately two years in advance, while quite\\ntrue, does not undermine the case for a\\nmultiyear budget. It simply reinforces the\\npoint that discretionary fiscal policy is\\nhazardous and ought to be viewed with great\\nskepticism whether the budget is annual or\\nbiennial.\\nSecond, seek out decisions that need not\\nbe made at all and stop making them. Some\\nspending programs could be consolidated\\ninto block grants or devolved to the states,\\nnot necessarily in the interest of smaller\\ngovernment, but in the interest of greater\\nresponsiveness to local needs and a less\\ncluttered federal decision schedule. In other\\ncases, the responsibility is clearly federal-as\\nin defense-but Congress would be doing its\\njob more effectively if it concentrated on\\nmajor policy issues rather than on details of\\nprogram management.\\nThird, in the executive branch, consoli-\\ndate authority for tax, budget, andfiscalpolicy\\nin a single cabinet department. The depart-\\nment could retain the name Treasury, but\\nmight better be called the Department of\\nEconomic Affairs. The Secretary of Eco-\\nnomic Affairs should have a high level chief\\neconomist or economic council with a strong\\nprofessional staff. The chief economist should\\nwork closely with the budget director who\\nalso should report to the Secretary. The pur-\\npose would be to bring together economic\\ndecisions now made in OMB, CEA, and\\nTreasury under one high-level responsible\\nperson, to relieve the president of the duty\\nof adjudicating among so many potentially\\nwarring power centers, and to increase the\\nchances of building a highly professional\\npermanent economic staff one step removed\\nfrom the short-run political concerns of the\\nWhite House.\\nFourth, streamline the congressional\\ncommittee structure to reduce the number of\\nsteps in the budget process. The authorizing\\nand appropriating functions should be com-\\nbined in a single set of \"program commit-\\ntees,\" one for each major area of public\\nspending. This would imply a single defense\\ncommittee, for example, and a social in-\\nsurance committee. The tax committees\\nshould handle the revenue side-not ad-\\nditional spending programs as at present.\\nThe budget committees would be charged\\nwith considering fiscal policy and putting the\\nspending and revenue sides together into a\\nbudget to be passed by the whole congress.\\nThe Joint Economic Committee should cel-\\nebrate the important contributions it made\\nto economic understanding in the days be-\\nfore the budget process and then close up\\nshop.\\nFifth, bring monetary and fiscal policy\\ninto the same conversation. This end could be\\nfurthered by closer formal links between the\\ncentral bank and the Department of Eco-\\nnomic Affairs to dramatize the need for con-\\nsultation and interaction. The Federal Re-\\nserve chairman should make a report to the\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The Fed\\'s report should\\nbe an important input to congressional de-\\nliberations on fiscal policy.\\nSixth, strive for a government-wide offi-\\ncial economic forecast to be updated on a\\nregular schedule. The main purpose of the\\ncommon forecast would be to reduce the\\nconfusion generated by conflicting estimates,\\nbut the increased interaction between the\\nDepartment of Economic Affairs, the Con-\\ngressional Budget Office, and the Federal\\nReserve necessary to create such a forecast\\nwould increase mutual understanding of what\\nis happening to the economy and what the\\ngoals of policy should be. Occasionally, it\\nmight be necessary for one of the agencies to\\ndissent and explain why it disagreed with the\\nforecast, but these occasions are likely to be\\ninfrequent. There should also be more atten-\\ntion than at present to the consequences for\\npolicy of the forecast being wrong.\\nFinally, bring choices explicitly into the\\ndecision process, both in executive branch de-\\nliberations and, especially, in Congress. Those\\nproposing spending increases or tax reduc-\\ntions should routinely be required to specify\\nwhat is to be given up and to offer both the\\nbenefit and its cost as a package. In other\\nwords, proposals should be deficit neutral.\\nV. What Economists Can Do\\nFor their part, how can economists be\\nmore useful in the policy process? The press\\nand politicians often sound as if they are\\ntelling us to work harder: go back to your\\ncomputers and don\\'t come out until you\\nknown how the economy really works and\\ncan give us reliable forecasts. But economists\\nknow that the economic system is incredibly\\ncomplicated, and that increasing global in-\\nterdependence and rapidly changing technol-\\nogies and public attitudes are not making it\\neasier to understand. It is not likely in our\\nlifetimes that anyone will happen on a\\nparadigm that explains everything, or even\\nthat forecasting will become appreciably\\nmore accurate. Like the medical profession,\\nwhich also deals with an incredibly complex\\nsystem, we economists just have to keep\\napplying our imperfect knowledge as care-\\nfully as possible and learning from the re-\\nsults. Both doctors and economists need\\nhumility, but neither should abandon their\\npatients to the quacks.\\nThe objective of economists ought to be to\\nraise the level of debate on economic policy,\\nto make clear what they know and do not\\nknow, and to increase the chances of policy\\ndecisions that make the economy work bet-\\nter. Much of the time that means telling the\\npublic and politicians what they would rather\\nnot hear: hard choices must be made. We\\nare stuck with being the dismal science.\\nIncreased effort in three directions would\\nmake economics more useful in the policy\\nprocess. First, economists should put much\\nmore emphasis on their areas of agreement.\\nThe press admittedly makes this difficult.\\nAgreement is not news, and the press\\' stereo-\\ntype of economists\\' diversity of views is so\\nentrenched that they will go to great lengths\\nto scare up a lonely dissenter to an almost\\nuniversally held economic platitude and give\\nher equal time.\\nEconomists realize that the breakthrough\\ninsights around which \"schools\" are built\\nare at best partial visions of the truth, but\\nour training leads us to elaborate and dif-\\nferentiate these insights, to explain to our-\\nselves and to others where they lead in\\ndifferent directions, not where they come\\ntogether. Yet areas of agreement are\\nwide -even in macroeconomics-and a\\nmajor effort to make this clearer to ourselves\\nand our audience would be useful.\\nSecond, economists should devote more\\nserious attention to increasing the basic eco-\\nnomic literacy of the public, the media, and\\nthe political community. While the print media\\nseem to me increasingly knowledgeable and\\nsophisticated about economic issues, televi-\\nsion, where most people get most of their\\ninformation, lags far behind. Television\\ncoverage of the economy is heavily weighted\\nto isolated economic statistics reported with-\\nout context-the wholesale price index in-\\ncreased two-tenths of a percent in October\\n-and talking heads disagreeing, briefly, for\\nsome obscure reason. Some of the best news-\\ncasters appear to have bad cases of econom-\\nics phobia.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Condorcet,\\nand Other Writers,\" begins with an objection\\nto the conclusion of these writers that the\\neconomic position of mankind will continue\\nto improve over time. In the process of re-\\nbutting their arguments, Malthus develops\\nhis famous theory of population growth and\\nreaches much more pessimistic conclusions\\nabout the long-term economic prospects of\\nthe average family.\\nYou will recall that the Malthusian model\\nassumes diminishing returns to increases in\\nthe level of population-that is, to increases\\nin employment-when land and other capital\\nare fixed. The analytical heart of his model\\n(I am not concerned with the details of what\\nhe actually said) is consistent with constant\\nreturns to the scale of labor and capital, as\\nlong as the capital stock, including usable\\nland, does not respond to changes in wages\\nand interest rates.\\nThe response of fertility and mortality to\\nchanges in income determine the Malthusian\\nsupply of population. Population grows more\\nslowly when wages are low because the aver-\\nage person marries later and thereby has\\nfewer children (the preventive check on\\npopulation), and also because deaths in-\\ncrease when families are poorer (the positive\\ncheck). Historical studies indicate that the\\neffect of the economy on age at marriage was\\nconsiderably greater, at least in Europe, than\\nwas its effect on death rates (see Ronald D.\\nLee, 1987b, pp. 450-51). Therefore, I will\\nignore the positive effect and consider only\\nthe preventive check through changes in the\\nnumber of children.\\nThe long-run equilibrium wage rate is\\nfound at the point on the positively inclined\\npopulation supply curve where the average\\nfamily has two children. The economy\\'s pro-\\nduction function then determines the sta-\\ntionary level of population that is consistent\\nwith this long-run wage rate. There is no\\npresumption that this equilibrium wage is at\\nthe subsistence level, especially if the posi-\\ntive check through death rates is not im-\\nportant. In this model tastes for marriage\\nand children, not vague notions of sub-\\nsistence, determine long-run wages.\\nThe long-run wage is stable in the Mal-\\nthusian model when shocks push the system\\nout of equilibrium. For example, if an infec-\\ntious disease destroys much of the popula-\\ntion, as the Black Death destroyed perhaps\\n25 percent of certain European populations\\nduring the fourteenth century, the decline in\\npopulation raises the marginal productivity\\nof labor. The resulting rise in wages encour-\\nages families to marry earlier and have more\\nchildren. Population begins to grow and its\\nincrease over time lowers wage rates back\\ntoward equilibrium. Ultimately, this dy-\\nnamic process restores both the wage rate\\nand the level of population to their long-run\\nlevels.\\nIf the amount of usable land increases,\\nwages rise and that stimulates higher birth\\nrates. Again, the growth in population con-\\ntinues to lower wage rates until eventually\\nthe long-run wage is restored. However,\\npopulation is permanently higher because\\nthe amount of land is greater.\\nThis example brings out that the equi-\\nlibrium wage is more immune to shocks in\\nthe Malthusian system than is the level of\\npopulation. Indeed, if tastes are stable over\\ntime-the Malthusian model, along with\\nGeorge Stigler and myself (1977), assumes\\nde gustibus non est disputandum -and if\\ntechnology does not continue to improve,\\nthe equilibrium wage rate remains fixed by\\nthe point on the stable supply curve where\\nthe typical couple has two surviving children.\\nThe Malthusian model does help some in\\nexplaining very long-term changes in\\nEuropean wage rates prior to the nineteenth\\ncentury (Lee, 1987b, gives a good analysis of\\nthe evidence). People evidently married\\nearlier when wages were above the equi-\\nlibrium level and married later when they\\nwere below.\\nIt is ironic that Malthus\\'s first essay on\\npopulation was published in 1798 at the\\nclose of the eighteenth century. Although his\\nsystem was accepted by many leading\\neconomists of the nineteenth century (see\\nJohn Stuart Mill, 1848, Book I, ch. X), events\\nafter publication were not kind to the the-\\nory.

If technology and\\npreferences do not change over time, both\\nmodels have stable steady-state levels of per\\ncapita income. The neoclassical equilibrating\\nmechanism works through changes in the\\nrate of investment, while the Malthusian\\nmechanism works through changes in the\\nrate of population growth. To illustrate, if\\nthe capital-labor ratio exceeds its steady-state\\nlevel, the rate of return on capital is below\\nand the wage rate is above their steady-state\\nlevels. In the neoclassical model this discour-\\nages investment, which lowers the capital-\\nlabor ratio over time (with exogenous popu-\\nlation growth). In the Malthusian model this\\nencourages population growth, which also\\nlowers the capital-labor ratio over time (with\\nexogenous investment in capital). We have\\nseen that a shock to population in the\\nMalthusian model has no effect on the level\\nof population or per capita income in the\\nlong run. Similarly, in the neoclassical model\\na shock to the capital stock (perhaps wartime\\ndestruction of capital) has no long-run effect\\non the aggregate capital stock or per capita\\nincome.\\nThe persistent growth in per capita in-\\ncomes during the past two centuries is no\\neasier to explain within the neoclassical\\nframework than within the Malthusian. Of\\ncourse, the neoclassical model postulates ex-\\nogenous technological progress to \"explain\"\\ncontinuing growth in per capita incomes, but\\nthe need to rely on \"exogenous\" progress is\\na confession of failure to explain growth\\nwithin the model. Moreover, the Malthusian\\nmodel can equally well postulate exogenous\\nprogress to \"explain\" persistent growth.\\nII. The Family and Economic Growth\\nAfter a short while the economics profes-\\nsion became disenchanted with the neoclas-\\nsical model, presumably because it too did\\nnot help in understanding progress. The ex-\\ncitement reflected in hundreds of papers that\\nextended and elaborated this model in the\\n1950s and 1960s gave way during the past\\nfifteen years to a lack of interest in the\\nanalytics of growth that is a little remi-\\nniscent of the situation during the first half\\nof the century.\\nFortunately, a more relevant growth model\\nis available through combining the best fea-\\ntures of the neoclassical and MIalthusian\\nmodels and by adding a focus on investment\\nin knowledge and skills. The neoclassicists\\nare right to emphasize endogenous capi-\\ntal accumulation and utility maximization.\\nMalthusians are right to stress the response\\nof fertility and other components of popula-\\ntion growth to changes in the economy, and\\nthat these responses can greatly influence\\neconomic change.\\nI will sketch out a modified neoclassical\\nmodel where parents choose both the num-\\nber of children and the capital (human or\\nphysical) bequeathed to each child. Parental\\naltruism or \"love\" toward children provides\\na powerful framework for the analysis of\\nboth the quantity and so-called quality of\\nchildren. Altruism means that the utility of\\nparents depends on the utility of each child.\\nThe assumption of altruism is realistic for\\nthe vast majority of families, although\\nparent-child interactions are determined also\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"by other motives. Presumably, the altruism\\nper child is negatively related to the number\\nof children, so that an additional child lowers\\nthe utility per child to parents in the same\\nway as (please excuse the analogy) an ad-\\nditional car lowers the utility per car.\\nSuch altruism is easily grafted onto the\\nneoclassical utility function by letting par-\\nents' utility depend on their own life-cycle\\nconsumption and separately on their degree\\nof altruism per child, the number of children,\\nand the utility of each child. This formula-\\ntion has the important implication that pref-\\nerence for parents' relative to children's con-\\nsumption (so-called time preference) is not\\nexogenous but rises as the number of children\\nincreases.\\nThe resources available to parents from\\nthe capital they inherit and labor earnings\\nare spent either on own consumption, on the\\ncosts of rearing children, or on transfers to\\nchildren of human and other capital. Since\\nchild rearing is time intensive, the cost of\\nrearing children is positively related to the\\nvalue of parents' time. Income per capita\\nwould rise between the parents' and the\\nchild's generations if the total capital be-\\nqueathed to each child exceeds the capital\\ninherited by each parent.\\nParents choose optimal values of their own\\nconsumption, the number of children, and\\ncapital transferred to each child while taking\\ninto account the cost of rearing children and\\nthe dependence of their utility on the utility\\nof children. This analysis has many implica-\\ntions for the behavior of fertility that Robert\\nBarro and I explore elsewhere (see 1987 and\\n1988). Here I concentrate on a few that alter\\nimplications of the neoclassical model about\\ncapital accumulation and growth.\\nIf the number of children demanded by\\nthe typical family is positively related to the\\nincome of parents (the Malthusian assump-\\ntions), or at least if it is not strongly nega-\\ntively related, then this model also has stable\\nsteady-state levels of the capital-labor ratio\\nand per capita income. But these steady\\nstates depend on variables that change the\\ndemand for children.\\nOne example is the consequences of an\\nextended but temporary decline in income\\nand productivity-perhaps due to the dis-\\norganization induced by a lengthy depres-\\nsion. In the neoclassical model this has no\\nlong-run effect on either per capita or ag-\\ngregate income. In our modified model an\\nextended decline in productivity can perma-\\nnently lower aggregate income because birth\\nrates may fall when productivity, wages, and\\ninterest rates fall. Recall the sharp decline in\\nbirth rates during the Great Depression.\\nJust over a decade age, Barro (1974)\\nshowed that a dose of family economics\\nradically alters traditional conclusions about\\nthe effects of budget deficits on private sav-\\nings. For example, deficits to finance Social\\nSecurity payments tax future generations to\\nsupport the elderly. Altruistic parents who\\nleave bequests to their children do not seek\\nan intergeneration redistribution of incomes,\\nso they would increase their bequests to offset\\nthe effect on children of future taxes. If these\\nfamilies are common, Social Security pay-\\nments and other public expenditures financed\\nby taxes on future generations would not\\nhave much effect on private savings. This is\\nthe so-called Ricardian equivalence theorem.\\nA larger dose of family economics gives\\nmore radical implications in some respects\\nbut also has more conventional implications\\nfor the relation between Social Security and\\nsavings. Various comments on Ricardian\\nequivalence emphasize that some families do\\nnot leave bequests; I will discuss these fami-\\nlies in Section IV. Development economists\\nhave long recognized that parents value\\nchildren who provide support during old age.\\nA Social Security system that replaces child\\nsupport of parents with public support raises\\nthe net cost of children to parents (not to\\nsociety) since they are no longer as useful to\\nelderly parents. As a result, a Social Security\\nsystem tends to reduce the demand for\\nchildren. Social Security also reduces the\\ndemand for children by parents who do not\\nreceive support but provide bequests. The\\nnet cost of children to these parents also\\nincreases when they raise bequests to offset\\nthe effect of Social Security taxes on children.\\nFor reasons given earlier, a lower demand\\nfor children raises the capital bequeathed to\\neach child. Therefore, Social Security and\\nother public transfers between generations\\nwould raise private savings per child, and as\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

Yet total private\\nsavings of the present generations would fall,\\nas in a conventional life-cycle analysis with\\nno bequests, if the decline in fertility exceeds\\nthe greater saving for each child.\\nConsider next an example from tax inci-\\ndence. A tax on income from capital initially\\nlowers after-tax returns and discourages in-\\nvestment. In the neoclassical model, capital\\nthen falls over time until the after-tax rate of\\nreturn again equals the given rate of time\\npreference. In public finance jargon, a tax on\\ncapital would be fully shifted in the long\\nrun.\\nA difficulty with this conclusion is the\\nneoclassical assumption that fertility is fixed,\\nwhich is especially inappropriate for very\\nlong-term changes in incidence. Fertility\\nwould fall as capital fell in response to the\\ntax if fertility is positively related to per\\ncapita income. A fall in fertility lowers pref-\\nerence for present consumption and raises\\nthe demand for investment in each child\\nthrough the interaction between the quality\\nand quantity of children. Then the equi-\\nlibrium after-tax rate of return must also\\nfall, and the tax on capital is only partially\\nshifted even in the long run.\\nThe conclusion is more radical if fertility\\nis negatively related to per capita income\\n(for reasons discussed next). Fertility then\\nincreases when the stock of capital falls.\\nSince the increase in fertility lowers invest-\\nment per child, the equilibrium after-tax rate\\nof return would have to increase. That is, we\\nhave the paradox that a tax on capital is\\neventually shifted by more than 100 percent!\\nLet me assure the theorists that this strange\\nresult does not violate the second-order con-\\nditions.\\nDoes a negative relation between fertility\\nand per capita income imply that children\\nare an \"inferior\" good (to use the economist\\'s\\ninfelicitous language)? The answer is no be-\\ncause the cost of rearing children increases\\nwhen the capital-labor ratio and per capita\\nincome rise since wage rates and the value of\\nparents\\' time spent on children rise along\\nwith the capital-labor ratio. Fertility would\\nfall if the positive effect on fertility of an\\nincrease in income is weaker than the nega-\\ntive effect due to the rise in cost. The sub-\\nstitution effect often dominates the income\\neffect in rich countries, for child care in these\\ncountries requires considerable time and en-\\nergy of parents.\\nIf fertility is negatively related to per capita\\nincome, an increase in the capital-labor ratio\\nabove its steady-state level would reduce\\nfertility and thereby encourage more invest-\\nment per child. The capital-labor ratio would\\ncontinue to increase over time if this positive\\neffect on investment dominates the negative\\neffect of a lower rate of return. Conse-\\nquently, a negative relation between fertility\\nand per capita income can destabilize what\\nis otherwise a stable steady state (see the\\nformal analysis in Robert Tamura, 1986).\\nDemographers have long been aware that\\nfertility eventually declines as a country\\ndevelops. Less well appreciated (although\\nsee the earlier literature by R. R. Nelson,\\n1956; Robert M. Solow, 1956, pp. 90-91;\\nS. C.

However, although a decline in fertil-\\nity is an important stimulus in early stages of\\ndevelopment, it alone cannot explain sus-\\ntained growth over a century or longer. In\\nthe absence of other forces, a growing econ-\\nomy with neoclassical production functions\\nbut without continuing technological pro-\\ngress eventually moves to a stable steady\\nstate with low fertility and high per capita\\nincomes.\\nA promising approach to sustained growth\\nthat complements the role of fertility builds\\non the special properties of education and\\nother learning. The important property for\\nthis purpose is that investments in education\\nand other human capital are more produc-\\ntive when past investments are larger. That\\nis to say, accumulation of knowledge and\\nskills in the past eases the acquisition of\\nadditional knowledge.

Modern econo-\\nmies spend enormous amounts on education\\nand other training of children, and parents\\'\\ninvestments in children are a far more im-\\nportant source of an economy\\'s capital stock\\nthan are bequests or the life-cycle accumula-\\ntion of physical capital. Dale Jorgenson and\\nBarbara Fraumeni (1987) estimate that hu-\\nman capital comprises over 70 percent of the\\ntotal capital stock in the United States. This\\nestimate may be too low because it does not\\ninclude the contribution of human capital to\\noutput in the household sector (the authors\\ndo try to estimate household output). Sev-\\nenty percent may be higher than the true\\nfraction because it makes no allowance for\\nthe contribution of \"raw labor\" to output. I\\nwould guess that the true ratio of human\\ncapital to the total capital stock may be as\\nhigh as 90 percent or as low as 50 percent.\\nOf course, even this lower percentage sig-\\nnifies a large contribution. The neglect of\\nhuman capital in wealth and income accounts\\ngreatly distorts comparisons of savings pro-\\npensities and the accumulation of wealth.\\nOnly recently have growth models begun\\nto appreciate the potential of the learning-\\nby-having property of human capital for\\ngenerating sustained growth in per capita\\nincomes (see Paul Romer, 1986; Robert E.\\nLucas, Jr., 1988; and Robert G.

Murphy\\nand I are developing an analysis that com-\\nbines such a human capital technology with\\nunskilled labor, physical capital, and endog-\\nenous fertility that results from altruism. (See\\nGary S. Becker, 1971, pp. 204, 207-208, for\\nan earlier effort to combine human capital,\\nunskilled labor, and physical capital.) Our\\nmodel has a \" Malthusian\" equilibrium where\\nper capita income is constant and low and\\nfertility is high. However, if this equilibrium\\nreceives big enough technology and other\\nshocks-good luck may be required-the\\neconomy takes off toward a perpetual growth\\nequilibrium with a decline in fertility and\\nincreased investment per child. Knowledge\\ncontinues to grow through its embodiment\\nin additional human capital.\\nFamily economics is critical to the analy-\\nsis since choices about number of children\\nand investments in each child\\'s human\\ncapital helps determine whether the econ-\\nomy ends up at a \"good\" (i.e., growth) equi-\\nlibrium or at a \"bad\" (i.e., Malthusian) equi-\\nlibrium. Obviously, we do not have the full\\nanswer to economic growth-public policies,\\nconglomeration effects, and other considera-\\ntions are surely important-but I do believe\\nthat our story contributes a sizable part of\\nthe answer.\\nIII. Short and Long Cycles\\nLet me now turn briefly to the relation\\nbetween family behavior and cycles in ag-\\ngregate output and other variables. For cen-\\nturies marriages, births, and other family\\nbehavior have been known to respond to\\nfluctuations in aggregate output and prices.\\nIn an early use of regression analysis in the\\nsocial sciences, G. Udny Yule (1906) demon-\\nstrated that English marriages and births\\nin the nineteenth century moved together\\nwith the business cycle. Subsequent studies\\nshowed that higher order as well as first\\nbirths, divorce rates, and possibly the labor\\nforce participation of secondary workers\\nall fluctuated procyclically in many coun-\\ntries (see, for example, Becker, 1960, and\\nMorris Silver, 1965). Birth rates in the United\\nStates apparently became countercyclical\\nafter many married women entered the labor\\nforce. Children are cheaper during recessions\\nbecause the value of time spent on children\\nby working mothers is low then (see William\\nP. Butz and Michael P. Ward, 1979). Invest-\\nments in education and other human capital\\nare much less procyclical than investments\\nin physical capital also because the foregone\\nvalue of time spent in school is cheaper\\nduring bad times (Linda N. Edwards, 1975).\\nOf course, none of the competing macro\\nmodels of business cycles-be they Keynes-\\nian, monetarist, neoclassical, or real-rely\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"on family behavior to cause business cycles.\\nHowever, declining population growth was a\\nmajor cause of the secular stagnation feared\\nby Alvin H. Hansen (1939) in his presiden-\\ntial address to our Association almost fifty\\nyears ago. Family behavior may play more\\nthan a negligible role even in generating\\nordinary business cycles. For example, an\\nincrease in the labor supply of married wo-\\nmen or young people when household work\\nor school becomes less attractive can induce\\ncyclical responses in aggregate output and\\nother variables. Cycles started by shifts in\\nlabor supply induce a negative relation be-\\ntween wage rates and aggregate output over\\nbusiness cycles. This would help explain why\\ncyclical fluctuations in real wages appear to\\nbe less positively related to cyclical fluctua-\\ntions in aggregate output than is implied by\\nbusiness cycles models that emphasize the\\ndemand side.\\nAlthough family behavior presumably has\\nonly a small part in the generation of\\nordinary business cycles, it is likely to be\\ncrucial to long cycles in economic activ-\\nity. Malthus claimed that family choices\\ncause long-term fluctuations in the economy\\nthrough the lagged effects first of marriages\\non births and then of births on the size of\\nthe labor force (see Maw Lin Lee and David\\nLoschky, 1987). Modern demographic analy-\\nsis generates long cycles in population growth\\nrates through the relation between aggregate\\nfertility and the age distribution, and per-\\nhaps also between fertility and the size of a\\ncohort (see, for example, James C. Frauenthal\\nand Kenneth E. Swick, 1983, and Ronald\\nLee, 1987a). In our modified Malthus-neo-\\nclassical model, family choices cause long\\ncycles not only in population growth, but\\nalso in capital, output, and other variables if\\nthe elasticity of the degree of altruism per\\nchild with respect to the number of children\\ndeclines as families get larger, a reasonable\\nassumption. Fertility and per capita income\\nthen fluctuate in generation-long cycles when-\\never the economy is disturbed away from the\\nsteady state (for a proof, see Jess Benhabib\\nand Kazuo Nishimura, 1986).\\nIn the 1920s, the Russian economist\\nNicholas D. Kondratieff claimed that capi-\\ntalist economies exhibit long-term fluctua-\\ntions of about fifty years' duration in output\\nand prices (see Kondratieff, 1935). Simon\\nKuznets (1958) later argued that long-term\\nfluctuations only last about twenty years. If\\nlong cycles of the Kondratieff or Kuznets\\ntype exist-we will need another 200 years\\nof data to determine whether they do exist\\nor are just a statistical figment of an overac-\\ntive imagination-they almost certainly will\\ndepend on fertility and other family deci-\\nsions that biologically require a long time to\\nimplement.\\nIV. Overlapping Generations\\nThe intrinsic risks faced by the elderly,\\nsick, and unemployed are surely no greater\\nin rich countries like Germany and the\\nUnited States than in poor countries like\\nChina and India, nor do these risks rise as a\\ncountry develops. Yet the first large-scale\\nSocial Security program was introduced by\\nGermany a mere 100 years ago. China, In-\\ndia, and numerous other countries still have\\nonly modest programs that exclude many of\\ntheir old people. We take publicly financed\\nschools for granted, but they were unim-\\nportant until the latter half of the nineteenth\\ncentury. Public and private programs that\\nprotect against the consequences of illness\\nand unemployment are even newer and less\\ncommon than Social Security and public\\nschools.\\nThroughout history the risks faced by the\\nelderly, young, sick, and unemployed have\\nbeen met primarily by the family, not by\\nstate transfers, private charity, or private\\ninsurance. Children usually cared for elderly\\nor infirm parents, the unemployed looked to\\ntheir families for temporary support, and\\nparents have spent much time, money, and\\nenergy to rear and train their children. De-\\nspite the rapid growth of Social Security\\npayments in the past few decades, almost 20\\npercent of women aged 65 and over in the\\nUnited States still live with their children.\\nThe altruism and love of parents, children,\\nspouses, and other relatives have helped pro-\\ntect family members against the hazards of\\nchildhood, old age, and other risks.

Parents can save less to offset the\\nnegative effect on their consumption of\\ngreater spending on their children's human\\ncapital, and they can reduce bequests to\\noffset the effect of lower savings on con-\\nsumption at old age.\\nBequests also partly insulate parents from\\nmany risks of old age.

Recall my discussion of the role of\\nhuman capital in economic development.\\nParents are eager to finance profitable in-\\nvestments in children called for by economic\\ndevelopment, as long as they can draw on\\ngifts and bequests that they would give to\\nchildren. But gifts and bequests would be-\\ncome nil in many families that invest a lot in\\ntheir children. These families would underin-\\nvest in children, particularly when pressure\\nfrom norms is weak. The growth in public\\nsupport of schooling and other investments\\nin children as countries develop would then\\nappear to be mainly a response to the posi-\\ntive effect of economic development on the\\nbenefits from human capital.\\nSince families that do not leave bequests\\nare vulnerable to the hazards of old age, it is\\nnot difficult to understand why public ex-\\npenditures on Social Security and medical\\ncare for the elderly have also grown rapidly\\nin industrial countries. However, you may be\\nsurprised to find out that public expendi-\\ntures on the old have not been at the expense\\nof the young. Since 1940 in the United States,\\nthe ratio of expenditures per child under age\\n22 to expenditures per adult age 65 or over\\nhas hardly changed. Our analysis that com-\\nbines investments in human capital with old-\\nage support does explain why expenditures\\non the old and young grew in tandem.

Probably much less\\nthan 40 percent of the earnings advantages\\nor disadvantages of fathers pass to sons, and\\nfew earnings advantages or disadvantages\\nsurvive three generations. Evidently, abilities\\nand other endowments that generate earn-\\nings are only weakly transmitted from\\nparents to children. This tendency to go\\nfrom \"shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves\" in three\\ngenerations began long before industrializa-\\ntion and government support of education\\nand other human capital. The fourteenth\\nArab historian and philosopher, Ibn Khaldtun\\nsaid (I owe this reference to my wife, Guity\\nNashat), \"Prestige is an accident that affects\\nhuman beings. It comes into being and de-\\ncays inevitably.... It reaches its end in a\\nsingle family within four successive genera-\\ntions.\" (1958, p. 279)... \"As a rule, no dy-\\nnasty lasts beyond the [span] of three gener-\\nations.\" (p. 343)\\nIn all these countries, low earnings as well\\nas high earnings are not strongly transmitted\\nfrom fathers to sons, and Knight\\'s claim\\nabout family life causing growing inequality\\nis inconsistent with the evidence. Still, data\\nfor both the United States and England do\\nappear to confirm the implication of our\\ntheory that low earnings persist more than\\nhigh earnings across generations (see W.\\nStanley Siebert, 1987). Of course, incomes of\\nthe rich regress down more slowly between\\ngenerations than do their earnings because\\nrich children receive gifts and bequests\\nfrom parents (see Becker and Tomes, 1986,\\nTable 2).\\nV. Concluding Remarks\\nI was attracted to the family by its obvi-\\nous importance in all countries, no matter\\nwhat the economic system or stage of devel-\\nopment. People spend much of their time\\nin a dependency relation-toward parents\\nwhen children and toward grown children in\\nold age-marriage is a crucial step for most\\npeople, children absorb time, energy, and\\nmoney from their parents, divorce often\\ncauses economic hardship and mental de-\\npression, and so forth.

In some cases the\\nconfusions do not make all that much dif-\\nference, but often they do.\\'\\nI. Measures of Income and Product\\nTake income for starters. We all know\\nwhat we mean by income, don\\'t we? Or\\ndo we? The theoretical Hicks-Haig-Simons\\n(J. R. Hicks, 1940, 1946, 1948; Robert Haig,\\n1921; Henry Simons, 1938) concept of in-\\ncome is that which we can consume while\\nkeeping our real wealth intact.

Did production really become more\\ncapital-intensive, did the capital mix truly\\nturn that much less durable,2 or is it possible\\nthat we are overstating capital consumption\\nand understating national and personal in-\\ncome and net saving, both in absolute\\namounts and as compared to the past?\\nWhat about capital gains and losses? If\\nthe value of our stock or bond or house goes\\nup, can we not consume the gain in addition\\nto what is usually counted as income, and\\nstill keep our wealth intact? We must indeed\\ndistinguish between the nominal gain and\\nthe real gain, that is, the increase in nomi-\\nnal value over and above the increase that\\nwould be necessary to compensate for gen-\\neral inflation.

And we might impute income to cap-\\nital invested by government and impute out-\\nput to the value of services produced by this\\ncapital. The value of public education, we\\nmay note, is taken as the wages and salaries\\npaid to teachers and janitors. We do not\\ninclude, as we would if education were pro-\\nvided by private business, any of capital\\ncosts that would be measured by interest on\\ngovernment debt, depreciation on buildings\\nand equipment or \"profit.\"\\nWe do include in gross national product\\nall of what we measure as government out-\\nput.

It\\nis widely argued, however much, as I have\\nsuggested, on the basis of improper mea-\\nsures, that our presumed budget and trade\\ndeficits will tarnish our golden years or con-\\ntribute undue and possibly unsustainable\\nburdens to our children and grandchildren.\\nFlowing from this argument have been a\\nnumber of proposals of new accounting for\\nour vast Social Security system. However\\nwell-intentioned, they threaten to make our\\nfiscal mess all the worse.\\nThere have, on the one hand, been sugges-\\ntions that we bring our huge \"contingent\\nliabilities\" into the general federal account-\\ning framework. We would, for example, in-\\nclude the present value of expected payouts\\nto future retirees, net of their expected \"con-\\ntributions\" or tax payments, as federal debt.\\nIncreases in this net debt would then add to\\nour measure of the deficit; decreases would\\nreduce it. At first glance, this would seem\\nsound. The budget would be truly \"unified.\"\\nBut would debt and deficits so measured\\nreally match our theoretical constructs? Can\\nwe expect agents to react in the same fashion\\nto uncertain and currently illiquid potential\\nreceipts decades in the future as they would\\nto liquid current cash or Treasury bills?

To be confident that\\nthey would, one would have to believe that\\nthe reductions in interest rates that they\\nmight generate would increase investment\\ndemand more than the reductions in con-\\nsumption and output would decrease it. The\\nreasons for doubt are of course to be found  in John M. Keynes, and their formal theoret-\\nical formulation in Oscar Lange\\'s (1938), (I\\nhope not forgotten) distinguished article of\\nhalf a century ago on the \"Optimal Propen-\\nsity to Consume.\" Some decades of work on\\ninvestment functions and the role of output\\nand accelerator effects versus that of interest\\nrates and costs of capital, to which I confess\\nto having contributed my share,28 would\\nseem to offer ample empirical support for\\nthat doubt.\\nBut fuller and more appropriate measures\\nof investment and productivity might make\\nclear that the best and perhaps the only\\nfeasible way to provide the sustenance of our\\nfuture aged is to develop our public, social\\ninfrastructure and endow our young with all\\nof the education, training, research output,\\nand good health that our society is capable\\nof offering. One or two more generations\\nwith large proportions of illiterates and\\nsemiliterates will hardly produce a labor\\nforce adequately equipped for productive\\nemployment in the 21st century.

I believe that,\\nwhen the nation gets around to eliminating\\nor substantially reducing the federal deficit,\\nthe income tax should play an important\\nrole.4\\nDistribution of Income and Tax Burdens\\nIt is well known that, after several decades\\nof relative stability, the U.S. pre-tax income\\ndistribution has become much more unequal\\nin the last ten years. Official statistics under-\\nstate the increasing inequality. At the same\\ntime, the tax system as a whole-and the\\nincome tax in particular-has become less\\nequalizing, so that the trend toward inequal-\\nity is even more pronounced after tax than\\nbefore tax.\\nDistribution of Income. The longest contin-\\nuous and comparable income distribution\\nseries available to us comes from the annual\\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) of the\\nCensus Bureau. The figures show that the\\nshare of total income received by the highest\\nfifth of the nation's families fell from 1948 to\\n1952, remained unchanged between 1952 and\\n1981, and then rose from 1981 to 1988. By\\n1988, the share of the top fifth was the\\nhighest ever recorded. The figures for the top\\n5 percent are similar, except that their share\\nin 1987 had not quite recovered to the 1952\\nhigh (Table 1).\\nIt is well known that very high incomes\\nare virtually unrepresented in the CPS distri-\\nbution and that official census statistics\\ngreatly understate income inequality in any\\nyear. What is not recognized is that the CPS\\ndata greatly understate the increase in in-\\nequality that has occurred during the 1980s\\nbecause very high incomes have been in-\\ncreasing much faster than the incomes in the\\nlower part of the distribution.5 This can be\\nseen by examining changes in the shares of\\nthe top income recipients reported in the\\nannual Statistics of Income published by the\\nInternal Revenue Service (Table 2).6\\nLike the CPS data, the tax data show that\\nthe very rich in the United States-defined\\nas either the top 1 percent or the top 5\\npercent of the income distribution-enjoyed\\nabout the same income increases as the aver-\\nage income recipient in the 1950s, 1960s, and\\n1970s, but their share of total income has\\nbeen rising in the 1980s. From 1952 to 1981,\\nthe share of the top 1 percent of the tax\\nunits remained in a very narrow range-be-\\ntween 8 and 9 percent of the total income\\nreported on tax returns. Since 1981, their\\nshare has skyrocketed to 14.7 percent in\\n1986. The same trends are shown by the top\\n2, 5, 10, and 15 percent of the tax units.\\nMuch of the increase in the share of the\\ntop tax units reflects the large increase in\\nrealized capital gains that accompanied the\\nbull market of the 1980s. But salaries and\\nother incomes of the top units have also\\nbeen increasing faster than average.7 In fact,\\nthe movement toward inequality must have\\nbeen even greater than the tax data show\\nbecause they do not include the large\\namounts of income taxpayers were able to\\nshelter before the enactment of the Tax Re-\\nform Act of 1986.\\nMany economists and statisticians have\\nexamined these trends, but nobody has been\\nable to explain them fully.

If the marginal utility of income de-\\nclines more rapidly than income increases\\nand the relation between income and utility\\nis the same for all taxpayers, equal sacrifice\\nleads to progression.\"4 Whether or not one\\nbelieves in sacrifice theory, the ability to pay\\nidea has been a powerful force in history and\\nhas doubtedly contributed to the widespread\\nacceptance of progressive taxation.15 Young\\nhas found that the equal sacrifice model fits\\nmost U.S. tax schedules in the postwar pe-\\nriod, with the notable exception of the\\nschedule adopted in 1986.

His prescrip-\\ntion was the pragmatic one that the tax rates\\nshould not impair economic incentives. In\\nhis policy statements, he argued in favor of a\\nbroad base and graduated rate schedule that\\nrises to a maximum of 50 percent.18\\nI agree with Simons that the income tax\\nshould be used to reduce the great disparities\\nof welfare, opportunity, and economic power\\narising from the unequal distribution of in-\\ncome.

       " \"efficiency reasons to prefer the expenditure\\ntax and these need to be addressed. S\\nA basic difference between the income and\\nexpenditure taxes is in the time perspective\\nof the two taxes. The perspective of the\\nincome tax is relatively short run-a year or\\nseveral years to allow for short-run income\\nfluctuations. Consumption is more stable\\nthan income and is alleged, therefore, to be a\\nbetter measure of long-term well-being. In\\nfact, under certain simplifying assumptions,\\nthe bases of taxes on the discounted present\\nvalue of income and expenditure are the\\nsame over a lifetime. Assuming perfect capi-\\ntal markets, constant discount rates that ap-\\nply equally to all people under all circum-\\nstances, tax rates that are constant and\\nproportional, and no gifts and bequests, the\\npresent values of lifetime expenditures of\\npeople with the same (discounted) lifetime\\nincomes are the same regardless of when the\\nincomes are consumed.26\\nAdvocates of the expenditure tax regard\\nthe lifetime perspective as a major advastage\\nbecause it permits them to pretend that tax-\\ning consumption is equivalent to taxing per-\\nsonal endowments. A tax on endowments, if\\nthey could be measured, would avoid the\\ndistortionary effects of either an income tax\\nor an expenditure tax. If it is assumed that\\nlifetime consumption approximates exidow-\\nment, then taxing consumption at flAtXand\\nconstant rates treats equally all taxpayers\\nwith the same endowment.27 The totaly' un-\\nrealistic assumptions underlying this line of\\nreasoning strain credulity, but it doestteem\\nto lie behind the strong support for thQ ex-\\npenditure tax by many economists.\\nThe lifetime perspective has little merit\\neven without the endowment rationale. In\\nmy view, it is difficult enough to measure\\neconomic circumstances over relatively short\\nperiods. Taxation of lifetime consumption\\n(or income) hardly seems appropriate in a\\nworld of changing tax rates, substantial fam-\\nily instability, economic and political change,\\nand uncertainty. Except for the attractive-\\nness of the arithmetic, lifetime economic\\ncircumstances as measured by discounted\\nlifetime incomes or consumption cannot be\\nregarded as satisfactory indexes of ability to\\npay.28 Moreover, taxation of annual con-\\nsumption expenditures at graduated rates\\nwould destroy the identity of lifetime taxes\\nof taxpayers with the same (discounted) life-\\ntime incomes.\\nThe expenditure tax is alleged to be supe-\\nrior to the income tax on the additional\\nground that the income tax reduces the re-\\nturn on saving and therefore encourages cur-\\nrent as against future consumption. Even if\\nsaving remained unchanged, the distortion\\ngenerates a welfare loss for consumers. It has\\nbeen pointed out by many economists that\\nthis effect must be balanced against the wel-\\nfare cost of further distorting the choice\\nbetween labor and leisure. There is no theo-\\nretical basis for judging whether the welfare\\ngain from eliminating the intertemporal dis-\\ntortion of consumption would exceed the\\nwelfare loss from increasing the intratempo-\\nral distortion of the labor-leisure choice.29\\nA tax that omits saving from the tax base\\ncan be shown to be the same as a tax apply-\\ning only to labor income and exempting all\\nproperty income.30 Several expenditure tax\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

There would also be no\\nneed to adjust the tax base for inflation, as\\nconsumption would be measured appropri-\\nately in current dollars. These are serious\\nproblems for income taxation and I shall\\ndeal with them later, but it would be unfor-\\ntunate to abandon the income tax for admin-\\nistrative and compliance reasons alone.\\nThe transition from the income tax to an\\nexpenditure tax would be troublesome. The\\nretired elderly would draw down assets, some\\nof which had previously been taxed under\\nthe income tax, to finance current consump-\\ntion that would be taxed yet again. To avoid\\nthis double tax, some method would need to\\nbe devised to identify consumption from\\npreviously taxed accumulations. Grand-\\nfathering all assets at the time an expendi-\\nture tax is initiated would leave a big loop-\\nhole for people with large amounts of\\nuntaxed accrued capital gains. But I have\\nnot seen any practical method of making the\\nnecessary distinctions in order to prevent\\nwholesale tax avoidance and to achieve\\nequity.32\\nUnder an expenditure tax, taxpayers who\\nsave could accumulate large amounts of\\nwealth over a lifetime. Many, but by no\\nmeans all, expenditure tax advocates support\\nwealth or estate and gift taxes to prevent\\nexcessive concentrations of wealth. But the\\nhistory of transfer taxation in this country\\nand abroad provides little assurance that\\neffective death and gift taxes would be levied\\nto supplement an expenditure tax.\\nProponents of expenditure taxation often\\ncompare the merits of a comprehensive ex-\\npenditure tax with the income tax as it has\\ndeveloped. It is hard to believe that an ex-\\npenditure tax would be enacted without nu-\\nmerous exemptions and exclusions. In fact,\\nmost of the eroding features of the income\\ntax (for example, preferences for housing,\\nfringe benefits, child care, state-local borrow-\\ning, etc.) might be carried over to the expen-\\nditure tax. Thus, an expenditure tax is no\\nless immune to erosion than the income tax\\nand, in such circumstances, it loses much of\\nits attractiveness.\\nI conclude that income is a better indica-\\ntor of ability to pay than consumption and\\nthat the major upheaval of substituting an\\nexpenditure tax for an income tax cannot be\\njustified on theoretical or practical grounds.\\nHow Much Progression? The effective de-\\ngree of progression of the income tax de-\\npends on the comprehensiveness of the tax\\nbase as well as on the tax rates. We have\\nlearned from experience that high, graduated\\ntax rates do not assure progressivity of the\\nincome tax. For most of the period since the\\nend of World War II, the top U.S. income\\ntax rates were 70 percent or higher. Yet little\\nequalization resulted because of the erosion\\nof the base of the individual and corporate\\nincome taxes and because of increases in the\\npayroll tax for Social Security.33 According\\n\\n###',\n",

In 1980, when the top tax rate\\nwas still 70 percent (though only on un-\\nearned income) and the corporate rate was\\n46 percent, the Gini coefficient was 0.4627\\nbefore tax and 0.4320 after the same taxes.\\nThus, as measured by the Gini coefficient,\\nthe equalization achieved by the federal tax\\nsystem declined from a modest 0.0317 points\\n(7.0 percent) in 1977 to an even more modest\\n0.0307 points (6.6 percent) in 1980 (Table 4).\\nTwo major pieces of tax legislation were\\nenacted during the 1980s. One increased in-\\nequality, the other reduced it. The 1981 Act,\\nenacted after Ronald Reagan's sweeping vic-\\ntory in the 1980 presidential election, in-\\ncreased inequality by reducing income tax\\nrates by 23 percent across the board (with a\\ntop rate on ordinary income of 50 percent),\\nlowering the capital gains rate to a maxi-\\nmum of 20 percent, introducing generous\\ndeductions for individual retirement ac-\\ncounts, and providing very liberal deprecia-\\ntion allowances for business investment on\\ntop of the previously enacted investment tax\\ncredit. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced\\ninequality by increasing personal exemptions\\nand the standard deduction, equalizing the\\ntax rates on capital gains and ordinary in-\\ncome, and closing numerous loopholes. At\\nthe same time, income tax rates were re-\\nduced to a maximum of 33 percent on indi-\\nviduals and 34 percent on corporations.\\nDespite the large rate cuts at the top of\\nthe income scale, the 1986 act increased in-\\ncome tax progression, though not to the 1980\\nlevel. By 1984, the equalization provided by\\nthe federal tax system had declined to 0.0184\\npoints (3.8 percent) in terms of the Gini\\ncoefficient. As a result of the 1986 act, the\\ndegree of equalization increased to 0.0218\\npoints (4.4 percent) in 1988 (Table 4). While\\nthis change is modest, it is noteworthy as the\\nfirst movement toward greater income tax\\nprogressivity at least since 1964, when the\\nKennedy-Johnson tax cut was enacted.\\nI suggest that a minimal goal of federal\\ntax policy in the next several years should be\\nto restore the equalization achieved by the\\nfederal tax system in the mid-1970s.34 While\\nthis may appear to be a modest goal, it turns\\nout to be a rather ambitious undertaking,\\nparticularly if income tax rates are to be\\nkept to moderate levels.

However, the optimal tax models are\\nbased on strong assumptions that are often\\nimplausible or virtually impossible to vali-\\ndate. Consequently, there is no empirical\\nbasis for determining how different com-\\nmodities and sources of income should be\\ntaxed. Moreover, the compliance and en-\\nforcement costs of such a system could be\\nlarge enough to more than offset the poten-\\ntial inefficiencies of a uniform tax. In the\\nabsence of reliable data, it is safer to rely on\\nthe comprehensive approach rather than to\\nintroduce tax differentials that will generate\\ntheir own distortions.36\\nAccording to Simons and others, income\\nis the sum of an individual\\'s consumption\\nand change in net worth during a particular\\ntime period. For a long time, the federal\\nincome tax base was a far cry from a com-\\nprehensive definition of income. In 1986,\\nhowever, Congress reversed its previous\\npractice and enacted a wholesale tax reform\\nthat moved the income tax a long way to-\\nward the Simons\\' ideal. This remarkable\\npiece of legislation can provide the basis for\\nachieving the distributive objectives dis-\\ncussed earlier with moderate tax rates.\\nThe 1986 Tax Reform.37 The Tax Reform\\nAct of 1986, a major step toward compre-\\nhensive income taxation, greatly improved\\nthe fairness and efficiency of the tax system.\\nThe major accomplishments of the act are as\\nfollows:\\nBy doubling personal exemptions and in-\\ncreasing the standard deduction, the act re-\\nlieved about 5 million poor people from\\npaying any income tax. This step restored\\nthe principle (abandoned by Congress in\\n1978) that people who are officially desig-\\nnated as \"poor\" should not be required to\\npay income tax. The principle was perpetu-\\nated by the resumption in 1989 of an auto-\\nmatic annual adjustment of the exemptions\\nand standard deduction for inflation.\\nSignificant increases were made in the\\nearned income credit for wage earners with\\nfamilies. These increases eliminated almost\\nthe entire Social Security payroll tax (includ-\\ning the employer\\'s share) for those eligible\\nfor the full credit and reduced the tax bur-\\nden for many low-income workers.\\nFor the first time since 1921, realized capi-\\ntal gains were made taxable as ordinary in-\\ncome. This is the keystone of comprehensive\\ntax reform: it reduces the incentive to con-\\nvert ordinary income into capital gains and\\nremoves one of the major elements of tax\\nshelter arrangements. Moreover, this change\\nmade it possible to reduce tax rates without\\nreducing the progressivity of the income tax.\\nA good start was made to reverse the\\nerosion of the individual income tax base.\\nFor example, unemployment benefits, which\\nwere previously taxable only if a married\\ntaxpayer\\'s income exceeded $18,000 ($12,000\\nif single), were made taxable regardless of\\nthe size of income. Deductions for state and\\nlocal sales taxes were eliminated and those\\nfor consumer interest were phased out. For\\nadministrative reasons, deductions for unre-\\nimbursed business expenses, costs incurred\\nin earning investment income, and other\\nmiscellaneous expenses were allowed only to\\nthe extent that they exceed a floor of two\\npercent of income.\\nSome of the most egregious loopholes and\\nspecial tax benefits were eliminated. Many\\ntax shelters were rendered unprofitable by\\ndenying deductions for losses from passive\\nactivity against income from anything but\\npassive activities.3\\' Tax subsidies for bor-\\nrowing (other than for mortgages) were elim-\\ninated by another limitation on the deduc-\\ntion for interest expenses to the amount of\\ninvestment income reported on the individ-\\nual\\'s tax return.39 Deductions for contribu-\\n\\n###',\n",

Tax\\npreferences benefiting defense contractors,\\nbanks, oil companies and other industries\\nwere narrowed. On top of all these changes,\\nthe minimum tax for both individuals and\\nbusiness was retained and strengthened.\\nFinally, the individual and corporate tax\\nrates were cut drastically. Under the individ-\\nual income tax, two rates-15 and 28 per-\\ncent-were substituted for the earlier sched-\\nule of 14 rates, which rose to a maximum of\\n50 percent. However, the benefits of the low-\\nest rates and of the personal exemptions\\nwere phased out for higher income taxpayers\\nat a 5 percent rate. As a result, the new\\nindividual income tax rate structure has four\\nbrackets, with rates of 15, 28, 33, and 28\\npercent (see Table 7). The general corporate\\nrate was cut from 46 percent to 34 percent.\\nDespite these large rate cuts, the act was\\nexpected to be roughly revenue neutral in\\ntotal over the first five years, but to shift\\nabout $25 billion of tax annually from indi-\\nviduals to corporations.\\nThe distributional effect of the 1986 act is\\ndistinctly progressive, especially if the in-\\ncrease in corporate tax liabilities is taken\\ninto account. I have calculated the change in\\naverage effective tax rates of the nation's\\nfamilies on the basis of the distribution of\\nincome estimated from the Brookings\\nMERGE file (Table 5). Total federal tax\\nburdens decline in the lower nine deciles and\\nrise in the top decile. In the lower deciles,\\nthe tax reductions result from increases in\\nthe personal exemptions, standard deduc-\\ntion, and the earned income credit under the\\nindividual income tax. The increases at the\\ntop reflect the broadened individual income\\ntax base, as well as the increase in corporate\\ntax liability, which is assumed to fall on\\nowners of capital in these calculations. How-\\never, as already noted, this increase in pro-\\ngressivity only partially reversed the reduc-\\ntions that had taken place in the 1970s and\\nearly 1980s.\\nThe Unfinished Agenda. Despite the pro-\\ngress made in 1986, the federal income tax in\\nthe United States falls considerably short of\\nthe comprehensive income target.40 I assume\\nthat we shall continue to tax capital gains on\\na realization, rather than accrual, basis, and\\nthat gifts and bequests will be taxed under a\\nseparate transfer tax. Nevertheless, a great\\ndeal more could be done to broaden the tax\\nbase for equity, efficiency, and revenue rea-\\nsons.\\nThe personal exemptions, standard deduc-\\ntions, and rate bracket limits are adjusted\\nannually for inflation, but the tax base is\\nnot. Of the two types of adjustment, adjust-\\nment of the tax base would be by far the\\nmore important. Perhaps the major reason\\nwhy the income tax tends to be in disrepute\\nis the discrimination against capital income\\ninherent in a nominal income tax.

Equalization of the tax\\nrates lowers the incentive to convert other\\nincome into capital gains, simplifies business\\nand financial decisions, and reduces income\\ntax complexity. Aside from the correction\\nfor inflation, the one additional reform\\nneeded in the capital gains tax is to include\\nin the tax base unrealized capital gains\\ntransferred by gift or at death. Taxing such\\ngains would reduce the lock-in effect of the\\ntax on transfers of assets and eliminate a\\nsource of horizontal inequity.\\nA major neglected problem in most coun-\\ntries is the erosion of the tax base from the\\nexclusion of employee fringe benefits.

Loopholes\\nfor union members and other workers are no\\nmore defensible than those for the rich. Tax-\\nation of fringe benefits would encourage their\\nconversion into cash compensation, thus giv-\\ning employees more control over the disposi-\\ntion of their income and the choice of the\\nproviders of their services. Australia and New\\nZealand have shown the way to reform in\\nthis area by taxing fringe benefits (other\\nthan contributions to pension plans) at the\\ncorporate tax rate. This method of handling\\na difficult, but urgent, problem is simple and\\neffective.\\nSocial Security benefits continue to receive\\nfavorable treatment, even though the elderly\\ncan no longer be regarded as a disadvan-\\ntaged group. Under current law, the medical\\ninsurance subsidies they receive are not sub-\\nject to tax, and less than half of retirement\\nand disability benefits is taxable to married\\ncouples with income above $32,000 ($25,000\\nif single). The value of the medical insurance  subsidies should be subject to tax in full\"4\\nand retirement and disability benefits should\\nbe treated like private pensions without any\\nincome thresholds, which would mean that\\nroughly 85 percent of the benefits would be\\ncurrently taxable.\\nThe treatment of owner-occupied housing\\nremains unsatisfactory. I assume that the\\nexclusion of imputed rent from the tax base\\nand the deduction of mortgage interest by\\nmost homeowners are sacrosanct, but it is\\npossible to limit the encouragement of bor-\\nrowing without promoting rearrangements of\\ndebt for tax purposes. The solution is to\\nbroaden the limitation on deductions of in-\\nvestment interest to include all interest pay-\\nments. That is, a deduction for all interest\\npayments would be allowed, but limited to\\nthe amount of reported investment income.\\nTo accommodate the home-owner lobby, the\\nlimit could be raised to net investment plus\\nan arbitrary amount, say, $10,000-enough\\nto take care of the vast majority of home\\nowners. The broader interest limitation\\nwould remove the discrimination against\\nborrowing for other purposes and the incen-\\ntive to substitute home equity loans for other\\ntypes of borrowing.\\nDeductions other than for interest are still\\ntoo generous. The Simons\\' definition of in-\\ncome includes all sources of income, without\\nany deductions for the uses of that income.\\nFor equity reasons, it is appropriate to per-\\nmit deductions for such unusual expenses as\\nmedical payments and casualty losses. I\\nwould retain the deduction for state income\\ntaxes to moderate interstate tax dif-\\nferentials.42 However, the property tax is\\nlargely a benefit tax and therefore should not\\nbe deductible.

Congress enacted a withholding system\\nfor these income items in 1982, but repealed\\nit the following year under pressure from the\\nfinancial institutions. Since information re-\\nturns are required for annual interest and\\ndividend payments of $10 or more, the\\nmarginal costs of compliance with a with-\\nholding system would be small.\\nOne of the major features of the 1986 tax\\nlaw was to telescope the schedule of tax rates\\ninto two acknowledged and two concealed\\nbrackets, a bizarre four-bracket rate struc-\\nture of 15, 28, 33, and 28 percent. The reduc-\\ntion in the number of brackets was a re-\\nsponse to the flat tax proposals that were\\nbeing promoted when the tax reform bill\\nbegan its journey through Congress, while\\nthe unsightly bulge in the rate schedule was\\nmotivated by revenue considerations. It is\\nnot necessary to return to 14 brackets, but\\nthere is room for more rate graduation with-\\nout the bulge.\\nIn this connection, consideration needs to\\nbe given to improving the structure of estate\\nand gift taxes to compensate for their low\\naverage rates. These taxes were almost gut-\\nted by increases in the exemptions and re-\\nductions in the tax rates when income tax\\nrates were cut in 1981. Now that the top  income tax rates are even lower, it is time to\\nrely more heavily on the estate and gift\\ntaxes.\\nThe reduction in the tax rates led to two\\nadditional changes in the 1986 act that I\\nbelieve were unfortunate.

A separate tax prevents individuals\\nfrom avoiding the income tax by accumulat-\\ning earnings at the corporate level, although\\nsome might question whether corporations\\nshould be taxed at a higher rate than the top\\nbracket individual rate. But in its present\\nform, the corporate tax encourages debt fi-\\nnancing. It is alleged to be a major cause of\\nthe recent upsurge in leveraged buyouts and\\nmergers. The remedy is not to allow a deduc-\\ntion or credit for dividends received at the\\nindividual level. Rather, the deduction of\\ninterest by corporations should be denied\\nwhile reducing their tax rate to the neighbor-\\nhood of 15 percent to maintain the revenues\\nnow produced by the corporate tax.46 The\\ncorporate tax would become a low-rate tax\\non net corporate income before distribu-\\ntions.\\nTax Rates and Progressivity.

The transition problems in\\nmoving from an income tax to an expendi-\\nture tax are extremely difficult. There is also\\na danger that the substitution of an expendi-\\nture tax for the income tax would greatly\\nincrease the concentration of wealth. More-\\nover, the public regards income, not expen-\\nditure, as the best index of ability to pay,\\nand it would be unwise to abandon this\\nfamiliar and widely approved basis of taxa-\\ntion.\\nThe 1986 reforms have greatly improved\\nthe federal income tax by broadening the\\nbase and lowering rates. But the progressiv-\\nity of the federal tax system has been declin-\\ning for the last two decades. As a result, the\\ndistribution of before-tax income, which has\\nbeen growing more unequal in the 1980s, has\\nbecome even more unequal on an after-tax\\nbasis. I have suggested that the goal of tax\\npolicy should be to restore the progressivity\\nof the income tax at least to its level in the\\nmid-1970s.\\nThe 1986 tax reform went a long way\\ntoward comprehensive income taxation, but\\nmuch more can be done to enlarge the tax\\nbase and to remove the preferences for capi-\\ntal income. Among the more urgent base-\\nbroadening reforms are the inclusion in tax-\\nable income of capital gains transferred by\\ngift or at death, elimination of the tax ex-\\nemption for newly issued state-local securi-\\nties, taxation of employee fringe benefits,\\ntreatment of Social Security benefits like pri-\\nvate pensions, reduction of the tax subsidy\\nfor home owners, pruning of the personal\\ndeductions, and withholding on interest and\\ndividends. To correct the measurement of\\ncapital income for inflation, asset prices\\nshould be adjusted for changing prices in\\norder to convert nominal to real incomes for\\ntax purposes.

A top individual income tax rate\\nof 31 percent and a corporate rate of 37\\npercent cannot be regarded as punitive or\\nharmful to economic incentives.\\nWhat is inappropriate in my view would\\nbe to introduce a value-added tax, as some\\nare suggesting. The value-added tax is re-\\ngressive and imposes unnecessarily heavy\\nburdens on the lower income classes. With\\ntax rates as low as they are today, more\\nrevenues should come from the income tax,\\nthe tax paid by those who have the ability to\\npay.

In\\nseveral of its main features that phase had\\nno precedent, and it will have no successor.\\nAssessing it requires a multidimensional\\nanalysis acknowledging the contributions to\\neconomics that were made, as well as the\\ntensions among economists that were\\nheightened.\\nThe development of mathematical eco-\\nnomics during the past half-century can be\\nread in the total number of pages published\\neach year by the leading periodicals in the\\nfield, an index that I will follow at first.\\nFrom 1933, the date when they both started\\npublication, to 1959, those periodicals were\\nEconometrica and the Review of Economic\\nStudies, and the index tells of the decline\\nfrom a high point, above 700 pages in 1935\\nto the lowest point, below 400 pages in\\n1943-1944. But 1944 marked the beginning\\nof a period of explosive growth in which\\nEconometrica and the Review of Economic\\nStudies were joined in 1960 by the Interna-\\ntional Economic Review, in 1969 by the\\nJournal of Economic Theory, and in 1974 by\\nthe Journal of Mathematical Economics. In\\n1977, these five periodicals together pub-\\nlished over 5,000 pages. During the period\\n1944-1977, the index more than doubled\\nevery nine years. By that measure, 1944 was\\na sharp turning point in the history of math-\\nematical economics. It was also the year in\\nwhich John von Neumann and Oskar\\nMorgenstern published the Theory of Games\\nand Economic Behavior.\\nWhile the professional journals in the field\\nof mathematical economics grew at an un-\\nsustainably rapid rate, the American Eco-\\nnomic Review underwent a radical change\\nin identity. In 1940, less than 3 percent of\\nthe refereed pages of its 30th volume ven-\\ntured to include rudimentary mathematical\\nexpressions. Fifty years later, nearly 40 per-\\ncent of the refereed pages of the 80th vol-\\nume display mathematics of a more elabo-\\nrate type.\\nAt the same time, the mathematization of\\neconomists proceeded at an even faster pace\\nin the 13 American departments of eco-\\nnomics labeled by a recent assessment of\\nresearch-doctorate programs in the United\\nStates (Lyle V. Jones et al., 1982) as \"dis-\\ntinguished\" or \"strong\" according to the\\nscholarly quality of their faculties. Every\\nyear the Fellows of the Econometric Society\\n(ES) certify new members by election into\\ntheir international guild, which increased in\\nsize from 46 in 1940 to 422 in 1990. For\\nthose 13 departments together, the propor-\\ntion of ES Fellows among professors was\\nless than 1 percent in 1940; it is now close\\nto 50 percent. It equals or exceeds 50 per-\\ncent for six of them, which were among\\nthose assessed as the eight strongest. So\\nmathematized a faculty expects its students\\nto have what it considers to be minimal\\nmathematical proficiency, and knowledge of\\ncalculus and linear algebra is required, or\\nforcefully recommended, for admission to\\nall 13 graduate programs.\\nSeveral scholarly recognitions lay addi-\\ntional emphasis on the role that mathemati-\\ncal culture is now playing in our profession.\\nOf the 152 members of the economics sec-\\ntion of the American Academy of Arts and\\nSciences, 87 are Fellows of the Econometric\\nSociety; and of the 40 members of the eco-\\nnomics section of the National Academy of\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

They indicate how extensive the\\nmathematization of economics and how\\ndeep the accompanying change of our field\\nwere over the past five decades.\\nThe perception of the depth of that\\nchange is reinforced by a comparison of the\\nlevels of mathematics required in 1940 and\\nin 1990 to follow the development of eco-\\nnomic theory in every direction it was tak-\\ning. Fifty years ago, basic undergraduate\\npreparation in mathematics was almost al-\\nways sufficient. Today, graduate training in\\nmathematics is necessary. If, instead of be-\\ning a follower, one wishes to be an active\\nparticipant in that development along its\\nmost technical avenues, a high degree of\\nmathematical professionalism is called for.\\nSeveral faculty members of the 13 depart-\\nments of economics mentioned previously\\nwere actually identified as mathematicians\\nby their doctorates; four of them served as\\nchairmen of those departments during the\\npast 25 years. If still sharper focus brings\\nout the intellectual leaders of that develop-\\nment, prominent among them is John von\\nNeumann, one of the foremost mathemati-\\ncians of his generation.\\nIn that development process, mathemati-\\ncal economics was continuously redefined as\\nnew territories were included within its out-\\nward-moving frontier and as topics that were\\nonce at that frontier became standard parts\\nof the graduate, if not of the undergradu-\\nate, economic-theory curriculum.\\nII\\nBefore the contemporary period of the\\npast five decades, theoretical physics had\\nbeen an inaccessible ideal toward which\\neconomic theory sometimes strove. During\\nthat period, this striving became a powerful\\nstimulus in the mathematization of eco-\\nnomic theory.\\nThe great theories of physics cover an\\nimmense range of phenomena with a\\nsupreme economy of expression. Of this,\\nJames Clerk Maxwell (1865) had given a\\nnotable example, as he described the elec-\\ntromagnetic field by means of eight equa-\\ntions at the time when mathematical eco-\\nnomics was born and came of age in the\\nmiddle of the 19th century. This extreme\\nconciseness is made possible by the privi-\\nleged relationship that developed over sev-\\neral centuries between physics and mathe-\\nmatics. In turn, the former presented the\\nlatter with open problems, or found to ques-\\ntions raised by physical theory ready-made\\nanswers discovered by mathematicians in\\ntheir abstract universe. Sometimes the\\ncausal linkage of research done in each one\\nof the two fields could not easily be unrav-\\neled; and, on occasion, the same scientist\\nmade inextricably intertwined contributions\\nto both disciplines.\\nThe benefits of that special relationship\\nwere large for both fields; but physics did\\nnot completely surrender to the embrace of\\nmathematics and to its inherent compulsion\\ntoward logical rigor. The experimental re-\\nsults and the factual observations that are at\\nthe basis of physics, and which provide a\\nconstant check on its theoretical construc-\\ntions, occasionally led its bold reasonings to\\nviolate knowingly the canons of mathemati-\\ncal deduction.\\nIn these directions, economic theory could\\nnot follow the role model offered by physi-\\ncal theory.

The rigor that has been reached\\nas a consequence is in sharp contrast to the\\nstandards of reasoning that were accepted\\nin the late 1930's. Few of the articles pub-\\nlished then by Econometrica or by the Re-\\nview of Economic Studies would pass the\\nacid test of removing all their economic\\ninterpretations and letting their mathemati-\\ncal infrastructure stand on its own. The\\ngreater logical solidity of more recent analy-\\nses has contributed to the rapid contempo-\\nrary construction of economic theory. It has\\nenabled researchers to build on the work of\\ntheir predecessors and to accelerate the cu-\\nmulative process in which they are partici-\\npating.\\nBut a Grand Unified Theory will remain\\nout of the reach of economics, which will\\nkeep appealing to a large collection of indi-\\nvidual theories. Each one of them deals\\nwith a certain range of phenomena that it\\nattempts to understand and to explain.\\nWhen it acquires an axiomatic form, its\\nexplicit assumptions delimit its domain of\\napplicability and make illegitimate overstep-\\nping of its boundary flagrant. Some of those\\ntheories take a comprehensive view of an\\neconomic system and bring insights into the\\nsolutions of several global problems. For\\ninstance, prices contribute to achieving an\\nefficient use of resources, to equalizing sup-\\nply and demand for commodities, and to\\npreventing the formation of destabilizing\\ncoalitions. In every case, a theoretical expla-\\nnation must be provided. The assumptions,\\nwhich cannot be satisfied by all economic\\nobservations, are the present outcome of a\\ncontinuing weakening process.\\nA global view of an economy that wants\\nto take into account the large number of its\\ncommodities, the equally large number of\\nits prices, the multitude of its agents, and\\ntheir interactions requires a mathematical\\nmodel. Economists have successfully con-\\nstructed such a model because the central\\nconcept of the quantity of a commodity has\\na natural linear structure. The action of an\\nagent can then be described by listing the\\nquantity of its input or output for each\\ncommodity (opposite signs differentiating\\ninputs from outputs). That list can be treated\\nas the list of the coordinates of a point in\\nthe linear commodity space. Similarly, the\\nprice system of an economy can be treated\\nas a point in the linear price space, dual of\\nthe commodity space, whose dimension is\\nalso the number of commodities.\\nIn those two linear spaces, the stage was\\nset for sometimes dazzling mathematical\\ndevelopments that began with the elements\\nof differential calculus and linear algebra\\nand that gradually called on an ever broader\\narray of powerful techniques and funda-\\nmental results offered by mathematics. Thus,\\nthe three roles of prices given earlier as\\ninstances were illuminated by basic mathe-\\nmatical theorems: the first, the achievement\\nof an efficient use of resources, by results of\\nconvex analysis; the second, the equaliza-\\ntion of supply and demand for commodities,\\nby results of fixed point theory; the third,\\nthe prevention of the formation of destabi-\\nlizing coalitions, by results of the theory of\\nintegration and of nonstandard analysis. In\\nthose three cases, the lag between the date\\nof a mathematical discovery and the date of\\nits application to economic theory de-\\ncreased over time. It was notably short for\\nnonstandard analysis, founded at the begin-\\nning of the 1960's by Abraham Robinson1\\nand applied to economics by Donald Brown\\nand Abraham Robinson (1972).\\nThe last, and most recently developed, of\\nthose three instances can be chosen, as can\\neither of the other two, for a more detailed\\nillustration. Competition is perfect when ev-\\nery agent's influence on the outcome of\\neconomic activity is insignificant. The in-\\nfluence of their totality on that outcome is,\\nhowever, significant. It is to solve the prob-\\nlem of aggregating negligible quantities so\\nas to obtain a nonnegligible sum that inte-\\ngration was invented.

Aumann (1964) showed that,\\nin a pure exchange economy composed of\\ninsignificant agents, the formation of desta-\\nbilizing coalitions is prevented if and only if\\nall those agents base their decisions on a\\nprice system.\\nThe concept of a convex set (i.e., a set\\ncontaining the segment connecting any two\\nof its points) had repeatedly been placed at\\nthe center of economic theory before 1964.\\nIt appeared in a new light with the intro-\\nduction of integration theory in the study of\\neconomic competition: if one associates with\\nevery agent of an economy an arbitrary set\\nin the commodity space and if one averages\\nthose individual sets over a collection of\\ninsignificant agents, then the resulting set is\\nnecessarily convex.2 But explanations of the\\nthree functions of prices taken as examples\\ncan be made to rest on the convexity of sets\\nderived by that averaging process. Convexity\\nin the commodity space obtained by aggre-\\ngation over a collection of insignificant\\nagents is an insight that economic theory\\nowes in its revealing clarity to integration\\ntheory.\\nAn economist who experiences such an\\ninsight belongs to the group of applied\\nmathematicians, whose values he espouses.\\nMathematics provides him with a language\\nand a method that permit an effective study\\nof economic systems of forbidding complex-\\nity; but it is a demanding master. It cease-\\nlessly asks for weaker assumptions, for\\nstronger conclusions, for greater generality.\\nIn taking a mathematical form, economic\\ntheory is driven to submit to those demands.\\nThe gains in generality that it has achieved\\nas a result, in little more than a century,\\nstand out when the first formulations of\\nthe theories of general equilibrium (Leon\\nWalras, 1874-1877) and of the core of an\\neconomy (Francis Y. Edgeworth, 1881 pp.\\n34-8) are placed side by side with the re-\\ncent treatments of those subjects to which\\nThe New Palgrave is an introduction and a\\nbibliographical key (John Eatwell et al.,\\n1987-1989). Walras's consumers and pro-\\nducers have been freed from many of their\\nconstraining characteristics; Edgeworth's\\nuniverse of two consumers and two com-\\nmodities has been vastly expanded.\\nMathematics also dictates the imperative\\nof simplicity. It relentlessly searches for\\nshort transparent proofs and for the theo-\\nretical frameworks in which they will be\\ninserted. Participating in that pursuit, eco-\\nnomic theory was sometimes drawn by drives\\ntoward greater generality and toward greater\\nsimplicity in the same direction, rather than\\nin opposite directions. Cohort after cohort,\\nstudents of consumer theory have learned\\nabout the concept of decreasing marginal\\nrate of substitution for two commodities on\\nan indifference curve and about its exten-\\nsion to the multicommodity case. Notably\\nmore general, and notably simpler, is the\\nconcept of convexity of the set of points\\npreferred to a given point in the commodity\\nspace. Welfare economics presents another\\ninstance. One of its main theorems formu-\\nlates precisely the principle enunciated by\\nAdam Smith (1776). If all the agents of an\\neconomy are in equilibrium relative to a\\nprice system, then they utilize their collec-\\ntive resources optimally. The proof of that\\ntheorem (Kenneth J. Arrow, 1951) has be-\\ncome so simple that it can be given without\\nmathematical symbols. It is, at the same\\ntime, of utmost generality; in relating two\\nbasic concepts of economic theory to each\\nother, it uses no assumption.\\nIn its attempts to attain its many objec-\\ntives, economic theory was helped by greater\\nabstraction. Preference theory supplies an\\nexample again. Significant research efforts\\nwere expended on solutions of the integra-\\nbility problem. That problem can be by-\\npassed altogether, and greater simplicity can\\nbe achieved by moving from the commodity\\nspace to the more abstract space of the\\npairs of its points. In this space, whose\\ndimension is twice the number of commodi-\\nties, the pairs of commodity points indif-\\nferent to each other are now assumed to\\nform a smooth (hyper)surface.

A newly\\ndiscovered interpretation can then increase\\nconsiderably the range of applicability of\\nthe theory without requiring any change in\\nits structure. Thus, by making the transfer\\nof a good or service between two agents\\ncontingent on the state of the world that\\nwill obtain, Arrow (1953) made possible the\\nimmediate extension of the economic theory\\nof certainty to an economic theory of uncer-\\ntainty by a simple reinterpretation of the\\nconcept of a commodity. The theory of fi-\\nnancial markets has been influenced by that\\nview of uncertainty, and their practice has\\nnot been unaffected. Finally, take the prob-\\nlem of existence of a general equilibrium,\\nonce considered to be one of the most ab-\\nstract questions of economic theory. The\\nsolutions that were proposed in the early\\n1950's paved the way for the algorithms for\\nthe computation of equilibria of Herbert E.\\nScarf (1973) and for several of the develop-\\nments of applied general equilibrium analy-\\nsis (Scarf and John B. Shoven, 1984). In this\\ncase, abstraction in economic theory led to\\nthe study of fundamental problems of great\\ngenerality, but also to a broad range of\\napplications.\\nIII\\nThe list of advances that the mathemati-\\nzation of economic theory helped or permit-\\nted is already long; and in one aspect it may\\nappear lengthy. Ceteris paribus, one cannot\\nprefer less to more rigor, lesser to greater\\ngenerality, or complexity to simplicity; but\\nother things are not equal, and in the esti-\\nmate of many members of our Association\\nthe cost of that mathematization sometimes\\noutweighs its benefit. Two of its presidential\\naddresses notably confronted that difficult\\nanalysis and stressed the price that eco-\\nnomics paid for its increased use of mathe-\\nmatics. Wassily Leontief's (1971) observa-\\ntions were factual, and Robert A. Gordon's\\n(1976) comments relevant when they were\\nmade in 1970 and in 1975. They still are\\ntoday, for, in spite of their authorities, en-\\nhanced by the platform from which they\\nwere speaking, and in spite of the wide\\ndiffusion of their critiques, neither Leontief\\nnor Gordon altered the course of the devel-\\nopment they were assessing. In the past two\\ndecades, economic theory has been carried\\naway further by a seemingly irresistible cur-\\nrent that can be explained only partly by the\\nintellectual successes of its mathematiza-\\ntion.\\nEssential to an attempt at a fuller expla-\\nnation are the values imprinted on an\\neconomist by his study of mathematics.\\nWhen a theorist who has been so typed\\njudges his scholarly work, those values do\\nnot play a silent role; they may play a deci-\\nsive role. The very choice of the questions\\nto which he tries to find answers is influ-\\nenced by his mathematical background.\\nThus, the danger is ever present that the\\npart of economics will become secondary, if\\nnot marginal, in that judgment.\\nThe reward system of our profession rein-\\nforces the effects of that autocriticism. De-\\ncisions that shape the career of an economic\\ntheorist are made by his peers. Whether\\nthey are referees of a journal or of a re-\\nsearch organization, members of an ap-\\npointment or of a promotion committee,\\nwhen they sit as judges in any capacity, their\\nverdicts will not be independent of their\\nown values. An economist who appears in\\ntheir court rarely ignores his perception of\\nthose values. If he believes that they rate\\nmathematical sophistication highly, and if\\nhe can prove that he is one of the sophisti-\\ncates, the applause that he expects to re-\\nceive will condition his performance.\\nThe same effects are also amplified by the\\nrelentless pressure to publish exerted by his\\nenvironment.

When the atmosphere has warmed\\nenough to intensify the thermal radiation so\\nthat it matches the absorbed incoming sun-\\nlight, equilibrium is achieved at the higher\\ntemperature.

The\\nphenomenon should have been called the\\n\"smudgepot effect,\" but it is too late to do\\nanything about it.\\nA first step in pursuing this phenomenon\\nis to assess how much warming might go\\nwith an enhanced concentration of these\\ngases. That cannot be done in the labora-\\ntory; there are too many feedbacks. A\\nwarmer atmosphere will contain more water\\nvapor; water vapor itself is a greenhouse\\ngas. Changes in temperature and humidity\\nwill change cloud cover; clouds can reflect\\nor absorb incoming or outgoing light accord-\\ning to their composition and altitude. The\\naverage temperature is only one dimension;\\ntemperatures at different altitudes and dif-\\nferent latitudes matter. But a starting point\\nhas been the change in average surface at-\\nmospheric temperature expected to accom-\\npany a specified increase in the concentra-\\ntion of greenhouse gasses; and arbitrarily,\\nbut reasonably, the base case is taken as a\\ndoubling of the concentration.\\nA moment on why a doubling is the\\nbenchmark. To compare estimates of warm-\\ning, people must use the same hypothesized\\nconcentration of greenhouse gases in the\\natmosphere. (Alternatively, they could use\\nthe same hypothesized temperature in-\\ncrease and estimate the corresponding con-\\ncentration.) Doubling, like a half-life in re-\\nverse, is a natural unit if it is within the\\nrange of practical interest, and it is. A dou-\\nbling is expected sometime in the next cen-\\ntury, so it is temporally relevant; and a\\ndoubling is estimated to make a substantial\\nbut not cataclysmic difference. If fixation on\\na doubling seems to imply an upper limit on\\nany expected increase, the implication is\\nunfortunate: enough fossil fuel exists to sup-\\nport several doublings.\\nIn 1979, a committee of the National\\nAcademy of Sciences (NAS) (1979 p. 2)\\nestimated the change in average tempera-\\nture to accompany a doubling of carbon\\ndioxide in the atmosphere: three degrees\\nCelsius, with a range of 1.5 degrees to ei-\\nther side. (In the last 15 years other green-\\nhouse gases have received attention; these\\nother gases can be converted to their car-\\nbon dioxide equivalents and the original\\nestimate applied to the mixture.) The NAS\\nappointed another committee a few years\\nlater to reexamine that estimate, and the\\nnew committee saw no reason to change it\\n(NAS, 1982 p. 51). An intergovernmental\\npanel on climate change (IPCC), consisting\\nof scientists from many nations, revisited\\nthe estimate in 1990 and concluded, from\\nthe several climate models they had exam-\\nined, that \"the models results do not justify\\naltering the previously accepted range of 1.5\\nto 4.5 degrees C\" (IPCC, 1990 p. xxv). Thus,\\nthe estimate appears to be robust over time,\\nbut the spread of uncertainty remains large:\\nthe upper limit is three times the lower\\nlimit. (No quantitative interpretation of\\nthese upper and lower \"limits\" has been\\nmade public. Both National Academy re-\\nports referred to them as \"probable error.\")\\nII\\nThe uncertainties are even greater in\\ntranslating a temperature change into cli-\\nmates. The media support a popular view\\nthat things will just get hotter; a news maga-\\nzine cover was a sweating global face. But\\nthe laboratories that do the meteorology do\\nnot simply predict warming; they do not\\neven predict that the most noticeable effects\\nwill necessarily be temperature changes.\\nAmong the great driving forces of weather\\nand climate is the temperature differential\\nbetween equatorial and polar regions; con-\\nvection currents coupled with the rotation\\nof the earth are engines of atmospheric\\ncirculation and, ultimately, ocean circula-\\ntion. The models predict greater tempera-\\nture change in the polar regions than near\\nthe equator. This change in gradient can\\ndrive changes in circulation.

Thus,\\nwhile it is wrong to think that what is going\\nto happen can be readily characterized as\\n\"warming\" it is not erroneous to take that\\naverage warming as a rough measure of the\\nextent or severity of change to be expected.\\nUnfortunately the widespread reference to\\n\"global warming\" promotes the notion that\\nthings will simply get hotter. (Interestingly,\\nvirtually all public discussion is on hotter\\nsummers, not warmer winters; a hundred\\nyears ago popular discussion of a warming\\ntrend would likely have concentrated on the\\nmilder winters to be expected.)\\nIf three degrees Celsius is taken as an\\nindex of climate change to come within the\\nnext century or so, how big is that compared\\nwith what has happened within the last cen-\\ntury, or the last 10,000 years? From what I\\nhave just said, this cannot be answered in\\nterms of whether anyone would notice the\\ndifference if every night and every morning,\\nevery winter and every summer, tempera-\\ntures were exactly three degrees higher than\\nthey otherwise would have been. The ques-\\ntion is: how would a three-degree change in\\na global average compare with what has\\nbeen experienced in the past?\\nThe answer is that for 10,000 years, since\\nthe disappearance of the last ice age, aver-\\nage temperature appears never to have var-\\nied over anything like three degrees. A band\\nof one degree Celsius would cover the cur-\\nrent estimates of what average tempera-\\ntures have been since the dawn of recorded\\nhistory. We will be moving into a climatic\\nregime that has never been experienced in\\nthe current interglacial period.\\n\"Mankind will undergo greater climate\\nchange in the next 100 years than has been\\nexperienced in the last 10,000.\" Properly\\nqualified, the statement is true; what it ne-\\nglects is that peoples have been migrating\\nover great distances for at least several\\nthousand years. Goths and Vandals, Huns,\\nWest Europeans who populated North and\\nSouth America, Southerners who went\\nNorth during the Great Depression, and\\nNortheasterners who moved southwest after\\nWorld War II all experienced changes in\\nclimate greater than any being forecast by\\nthe models. Almost everybody who attends\\nthis lecture in New Orleans will have under-\\ngone a greater change in the past few days\\nthan is expected to occur in any fixed local-\\nity during the coming century.\\nThe changes that the models produce are\\ngradual both in time and in space. The\\nmodels do not produce discontinuities. Cli-\\nmates will \"migrate\" slowly. The climate\\nof Kansas may become like Oklahoma\\'s,\\nNebraska\\'s like that of Kansas, South\\nDakota\\'s like Nebraska\\'s, but none of these\\nis expected to become like the climates of\\nOregon, Louisiana, or Massachusetts.\\nA caution: the models probably cannot\\nproject discontinuities-just gradual change\\n-because nothing goes into the models that\\nwill produce catastrophes. There may be\\nphenomena that could produce drastic\\nchange, but they are not known with enough\\nconfidence to introduce them into the mod-\\nels.

There are 700 billion tons of car-\\nbon in the atmosphere. (Quotations are\\nsometimes in tons of carbon dioxide, rather\\nthan carbon; the figure is then 32 times as\\nlarge, about 2,600 billion.) Annual emis-\\nsions are 6 billion tons. Close to half disap-\\npears somewhere, and a little over half\\nremains in the atmosphere; so the concen-\\ntration is increasing by one-half percent per\\nyear. It has increased 25 percent in the last\\nhundred years. (Concentration is reported\\nmore often than tonnage; it is currently\\nabout 350 parts per million.) And there are\\nupwards of ten trillion tons of carbon fuels\\nout there to be burned; if it were all burned\\nand half stayed in the atmosphere, the con-\\ncentration could double at least three times.\\nIf the carbon in the atmosphere has al-\\nready increased by a quarter, has the aver-\\nage temperature gone up as predicted? And\\nwere the recent hot American summers that\\nstirred popular interest harbingers of green-\\nhouse summers to come?\\nTo the first question, the answer is that\\naverage global temperature-summer and\\nwinter, both hemispheres, night and\\nday-has apparently risen by half a degree\\nin the last hundred years, but whether \"as\\npredicted\" depends on what qualifications\\none reads into the predictions. The pattern\\ndiffered between the Northern and South-\\nern Hemispheres. The global average rose\\nduring the first 40 years of this century, was\\nlevel for the next 40 years, and rose during\\nthe past decade. This pattern demonstrates\\nthat, whether or not we are witnessing the\\ngreenhouse effect, there are other decades-\\nlong influences that can obscure any smooth\\ngreenhouse trend. (The carbon concentra-\\ntion is not at issue; it is well measured and\\nshows steady rise on a decade scale.) There\\nare known phenomena that could account\\nfor the irregular temperature increase of\\nthe past century, and whether we are wit-\\nnessing the \"signal\" probably depends on\\nwhether one wants high confidence to reject\\na null hypothesis or is about to bet money\\non whether, another 25 years from now,\\nlooking back, all doubt will have been re-\\nmoved. I don\\'t know what bets are being\\nplaced by \"greenhouse scientists,\" but they\\nare cautious in public on the question.\\nTo the second question-do the hot\\nAmerican summers of the past few years\\nannounce the arrival of a greenhouse, con-\\nfirming predictions?-the answer is in two\\nparts: maybe it\\'s the greenhouse; but it\\'s not\\nwhat the greenhouse models predict. The\\nglobal average in the four hot years of the\\npast seven was only 0.2 degrees above the\\nlevel of the preceding 40 years; and sudden\\nhot American summers are not what the\\nmodels predict.\\nIII\\nIn anticipating the impact on human wel-\\nfare or natural systems, two kinds of uncer-\\ntainty are unlikely to be dispelled soon. One\\nis simply the question of what the changes\\nwill be in each region or locality. Current\\nmodels are severely limited in their agree-\\nment with each other, in their handling of\\nsuch topographical variables as mountain\\nranges, and in the fineness of the grids they\\nsuperimpose on the globe. There is no great\\nconfidence that the models will be greatly\\nimproved within the next decade or two. A\\nchaos-like process may defeat efforts to im-\\nprove local predictions; and uncertainties in\\ngross phenomena, such as the behavior of\\nocean currents under changed climatic con-\\nditions, may not be much better understood\\nsoon.\\nEven if we had confident estimates of\\nclimate change for different regions of the\\nworld, there would still be uncertainties\\nabout the kind of world it is going to be 50,\\n75, or 100 years from now.

Reliable forecasts of likely\\nclimate changes in the different areas so\\ndependent on agriculture are simply not\\navailable, so no assessment, region by re-\\ngion, of the effect on productivity can be\\nprovided. There is no strong presumption\\nthat the climates prevailing in different re-\\ngions 50 or 100 years from now will be less\\nconducive to food production.

Again, there is no strong presump-\\ntion that malaria mosquitos, to take an ex-\\nample, will on balance benefit from climate\\nchanges, but the risk is there.\\nIt is with the less-developed countries that\\nwe have to be most careful about superim-\\nposing the climates of the future on the\\neconomies and societies of today. As it was\\nin our own country during this century, the\\ntrend in developing countries is to be less\\ndependent on agriculture and less vulnera-\\nble to climate in transportation and other\\nactivities and health. If per capita income\\ngrowth in the next 40 years compares with\\nthe 40 years just past, vulnerability to cli-\\nmate change should diminish, and the re-\\nsources available for adaptation should be\\ngreater.

It is\\nnot economic growth versus environment; it\\nis growth with the environment taken into\\naccount.\\nA related point: population growth is im-\\nportant for the climate change, in two re-\\nspects. One is that carbon emissions in de-\\nveloping countries are positively driven by\\npopulation; population growth does not\\nmerely dilute carbon emissions per capita,\\nbut for a number of reasons more people\\nmeans more carbon. If China succeeds in\\nholding population growth to near zero for\\nthe next couple of generations, it may do as\\nmuch for the earth's atmosphere as would a\\nheroic Chinese anticarbon program coupled\\nwith 2-percent annual population growth.\\nThe other population effect is simply that\\nthe most likely adverse impact of climate\\nchange on human productivity and welfare\\nwould be on food production.

The answer must depend\\npartly on how expensive it is going to be to\\ndo anything about it.

De-\\nveloped countries are currently providing\\n$50 billion per year of assistance to the\\ndeveloping world; we would be talking about\\nexpending or forgoing perhaps 4-8 times\\nthat much to slow emissions and slow cli-\\nmate change. Whether people in the devel-\\noped democracies could be mobilized to\\ncontribute so much to benefit, half a cen-\\ntury from now, the people in the countries\\nwe now call developing I do not know, but I\\nbelieve that if the developed countries were\\nprepared to invest, say, $200 billion per year\\nin greenhouse-gas abatement, explicitly for\\nthe benefit of developing countries 50 years\\nor more from now, the developing countries\\nwould clamor to receive the resources im-\\nmediately in support of their continued de-\\nvelopment.

They typically\\nmake some assumption about a \"fallback\"\\nenergy technology, at least for electricity,\\navailable at some price in some decade of\\nthe next century. They have to project esti-\\nmates of non-price-induced improvements\\nin the use or avoidance of energy by indus-\\ntries and households. And if they deal with\\nglobal emissions, they have to make some\\nassumption about the distribution of abate-\\nment efforts among nations, especially\\namong the developing countries, which, in-\\ncluding China, account for about a quarter\\nof emissions now and would be expected to\\naccount for half by the middle of the next\\ncentury.\\nAny estimate of the cost of abatement\\nneeds therefore to specify at least half a\\ndozen target assumptions. Furthermore, the\\nestimates are produced by people and insti-\\ntutions that do not simultaneously estimate\\nthe costs associated with climate change,\\neither damages or costs of adapting; the\\nestimates do not optimize the combined\\ncosts of abatement and climate change. A\\n\"not unreasonable\" target for reduction\\nmight be delaying a doubling by, say, four\\ndecades. One decade might be too trivial, a\\ncentury too ambitious, and four decades an\\nobjective in which most audiences would be\\ninterested. But nobody who makes such an\\nestimate wishes to be interpreted as propos-\\ning that when all the uncertainties about\\nclimate changes and their impacts have been\\nresolved, if they ever are resolved, the opti-\\nmum reduction in emissions will be found\\nto retard doubling by 40 years, or any other\\nspecified period of time.\\nAll I can do to summarize a multitude of\\nestimates is to specify an order of magni-\\ntude that many economists and the Con-\\ngressional Budget Office would not consider\\noutrageous. That is the figure I mentioned\\nearlier, possibly 2 percent of GNP for the\\ndeveloped countries and a similar, but even\\nmuch more uncertain, percentage of GNP\\nfor the developing world. The uncertainty\\nfor the developing world is partly due to the\\nestimates being mainly derived from the\\nAmerican economy.4\\nTwo characteristics of these estimates\\nneed to be emphasized. One is that they\\ntend to assume optimal technological ad-\\njustment, as in response to a carbon tax. To\\nthe extent that carbon emissions are con-\\ntrolled by direct regulatory measures, there\\nmay be the usual expected inefficiencies,\\nand I leave the reader to make his own\\nadjustment.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

For reasons that I would be\\ndelighted to elaborate but for which I can-\\nnot take space here, a universal uniform\\ncarbon tax is not a solution that I can imag-\\nine. My reason is simple. A carbon tax suf-\\nficient to make a big dent in the greenhouse\\nproblem would have to be roughly equiva-\\nlent at least to a dollar per gallon on motor\\nfuel, and for the United States alone such a\\ntax on coal, petroleum, and natural gas\\nwould currently yield close to half a trillion\\ndollars per year in revenue. No greenhouse\\ntaxing agency is going to collect a trillion\\ndollars per year in revenue; and no treaty\\nrequiring the United States to levy internal\\ncarbon taxation at that level, keeping the\\nproceeds, would be ratified by the Senate.\\nReduce the tax by an order of magnitude\\nand it becomes imaginable, but then it be-\\ncomes trivial as greenhouse policy.5\\n\\n###',\n",

In the\\nend, they did not quite make it, the United\\nStates having to make the final allocation.\\nBut all the submission of data and open\\nargument led, if not to consensus, to a rea-\\nsonable appreciation of each nation\\'s needs.\\nThe negotiations were professional; they\\nwere assisted by a proficient secretariat. The\\nresources involved for most recipient coun-\\ntries were immensely important. Good rela-\\ntions were observed throughout; and profi-\\nciency in debate, acceptance of criteria, and\\nnegotiating etiquette steadily improved.\\nThat is the only model I find plausible,\\nand I believe distribution of Marshall Plan\\nand defense-support funds to Europe is the\\nonly model of multilateral negotiation in-\\nvolving resources commensurate with the\\ncost of greenhouse abatement.

The Allocation Task of Yesteryear\\nNearly two score years ago, on the occa-\\nsion of Columbia\\'s bicentennial celebration,\\nSir Dennis Robertson gave an address enti-\\ntled \"What Do Economists Economize,\" the\\nburden of which was that, since presumably\\neconomists are the most expert economiz-\\ners, they should economize the most pre-\\ncious thing in the world, namely, love, or\\naltruism. This would be done in part by so\\narranging things that in the ordinary con-\\nduct of life individual choices made on the\\nbasis of self-interest in terms of market\\nprices would at least be consistent with max-\\nimizing social welfare, so that the exercise\\nof scarce resources of altruism could be\\nconcentrated on situations where Adam\\nSmith\\'s unseen hand could not be made to\\nserve. To me, one implication of this was\\nthat economists should see to it that market\\nprices correctly reflect the relevant marginal\\nsocial cost of various alternatives. I have\\ndevoted a major part of my career to the\\npromotion of such marginal-cost pricing, but\\nthus far with a notable lack of practical\\nsuccess outside academia.\\nAt the time of Robertson\\'s address, in-\\ndeed, there was a certain euphoria prevail-\\ning among at least part of the economics\\nprofession over the prospect of curbing the\\nbusiness cycle and maintaining a high level\\nof economic activity through Keynesian fis-\\ncal policy. Under these circumstances it was\\nreasonable to think that the chief remaining\\njob of the economist was to assure a\\nPareto-efficient allocation of a given aggre-\\ngate of resources. The event, however,\\nproved otherwise. The conventional wisdom\\nof regarding budget deficits as improvident\\nprodigality, and government debt as the\\nlegacy of a craven deferral of burden to the\\nfuture, resumed command.\\nOne eminent economist is said to have\\nremarked, in effect, that it was the function\\nof the science of public finance to see to it\\nthat nothing of importance is ever done or\\nleft undone merely for financial reasons.\\nAlas, the financial reasons have thus far\\ncarried the day, and we have not had any-\\nthing approaching real full employment\\nsince the Korean War, or indeed in peace-\\ntime at any time since 1925, if then, at least\\nin terms of the Beveridge definition of full\\nemployment as a situation wherein there\\nare at least as many unfilled job openings as\\nthere are unemployed individuals seeking\\nwork.\\nIn the Eisenhower years, the conven-\\ntional wisdom held sway in spite of the\\nabsence of serious contraindications to the\\nKeynesian prescription. In the 1960\\'s, the\\nsimple Keynesian analysis began to be called\\ninto question by the emergence of stagfla-\\ntion, a phenomenon not contemplated by\\nthe earlier Keynesian models. A new rela-\\ntionship, the Phillips curve, relating the\\nevolution of inflation to the level of unem-\\nployment was added to the economists\\'\\narmamentarium, with its \"non-inflation-\\naccelerating rate of unemployment\" or\\nNIARU.\\nThis NIARU is of course not a fixed\\ndatum, but varies over time and place ac-\\ncording to the sociopolitical ambience, the\\nmechanics of the labor market, and the\\nvigor of competition. It may have been ris-\\ning over time as a result of the increased\\nsophistication and differentiation of prod-\\nucts, real and factitious, giving sellers, as\\nthe ones most knowledgeable about the\\ncharacteristics of their products and their\\nmarkets, considerable leeway to raise their\\nprices without unacceptable loss of sales.\\nThis process is ultimately held in check only\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'by the presence of underutilized labor and\\nother resources. Currently in the United\\nStates the NIARU appears to be around\\n4-6 percent.\\nIn some quarters this NIARU has even\\nbeen termed the \"natural\" rate of unem-\\nployment, in one of the most vicious eu-\\nphemisms ever coined. Some have even gone\\nso far as to define \"full employment\" as\\nbeing the NIARU. But while 5-percent un-\\nemployment might be barely tolerable if it\\nmeant that everyone would be taking an\\nadditional two weeks of vacation every year\\nwithout pay, it is totally unacceptable as a\\nsocial goal when it means unemployment\\nrates of 10, 20, or even 40 percent among\\ndisadvantaged groups, with resulting in-\\ncreases in poverty, homelessness, poor\\nhealth, drug addiction, and crime. Yet the\\nhard political fact is that at such a NIARU\\nthe great majority of the voting population,\\nincluding most of the politically active up-\\nper and middle classes, will have relatively\\nlittle personal experience of severe unem-\\nployment, while nearly everyone will have\\nsome direct experience of inflation. Many\\nseem to feel that if only prices would stop\\nrising they would benefit correspondingly by\\nhaving their income go further, giving rela-\\ntively little thought to the effect on their\\nincomes. Even those with large mortgages\\nor other debts, who would actually gain\\nfrom inflation, tend to concur in the notion\\nthat they suffer from it. It is thus extremely\\ndifficult to get political support for anti-\\nunemployment measures that are perceived\\nas involving a threat of inflation, at least\\nuntil unemployment reaches 7 percent or\\nmore, at which point unemployment be-\\ncomes a more widespread threat.\\nActually it is the uncertainty as to the\\nrate of inflation, and not its level, that does\\nthe damage. An assured, moderate rate of\\ninflation can be adapted to by adjusting\\nnominal rates of interest and the terms of\\nlong-term contracts involving money pay-\\nments. The \"menu cost\" of changing price\\ntags and catalog quotations is probably less\\nimportant than the mental effort required\\nof consumers in forming an idea of what an\\nappropriate current price is for infrequently\\npurchased items, such as furniture or cloth-\\ning.

A tax\\nbased on nominal accrued income would in\\neffect be a tax on a base consisting of real\\nincome plus a percentage of net worth.\\nWhile this is not what is meant by an ideo-\\nlogically pure income tax, in terms of its\\npractical effects it can be deemed a superior\\ntax.\\nIt is the possibility of substantial changes\\nin the rate of inflation, either up or down,\\nthat does the damage. Such changes involve\\na disappointment of expectations and a re-\\ndistribution of wealth and income derived\\nfrom a given national product that is capri-\\ncious and often inequitable, but it does not\\nof itself substantially reduce the amount to\\nbe distributed.

Eliminating the Corporation Income Tax\\nOther classical approaches to improving\\nthe unemployment situation exist but have\\ntheir own political opposition and in any\\ncase are too weak to make much of a dent\\nin a very large need. One such measure\\nwould be the abolition of the corporation\\nincome tax, which is by far the most serious\\nhurdle in the way of private capital forma-\\ntion of a kind requiring equity funding. Un-\\nlike the capital-gains tax, the corporate in-\\ncome tax is a tax largely above or before the\\nmarket, requiring a rate of return on invest-\\nment sufficient to cover the corporation tax\\nand leave a rate of return after tax compa-\\nrable to other investments, whereas the\\ncapital-gains tax operates largely as a reduc-\\ntion in the return to the investor after or\\nbelow the market, comparable to the reduc-\\ntion of net income to the taxpayer resulting\\nfrom the personal income tax on other in-\\ncome. In addition, the corporation tax\\ncauses inefficient allocation of investment\\nbetween equity-type and loan-type invest-\\nments; it encourages thin equity and result-\\ning bankruptcies and reorganizations, and it\\nlubricates takeovers and mergers of dubious\\nintrinsic merit.\\nReduction of the tax on capital gains, on\\nthe other hand, might actually depress eco-\\nnomic activity if the additional savings out\\nof the tax reduction were to exceed the\\nadditional capital formation induced. This is\\nthe more likely in that most of the tax\\nreduction is likely to be saved immediately,\\nwhereas the inducement to capital forma-\\ntion is in terms of a tax reduction in a\\nrelatively remote future, subject to legisla-\\ntive vicissitudes. At best, special treatment\\nof capital gains greatly increases the com-\\nplexity of the tax law and diverts investment\\nflows from their most efficient use. There is\\nnothing to indicate that investments likely\\nto yield returns in forms defined by the tax\\ncode as capital gains will have any superior\\nsocial value: gains from land speculation, in\\nparticular, add nothing to the real availabil-\\nity of resources.\\nAs for the corporate income tax, in spite\\nof its many defects from the standpoint of\\neconomic efficiency, it has enormous politi-\\ncal popularity due to the fact that nearly\\neveryone thinks that it is paid by someone\\nelse.

This\\nwould not only improve the equity and pro-\\ngressivity of the income tax but go a sub-\\nstantial way toward making more units\\navailable for rental and, to a modest extent,\\npromoting the construction of additional\\naffordable rental housing and abating the\\nproblem of homelessness. A similar case\\ncan be made for including in the income tax\\nbase a net rental value of nonbusiness auto-\\nmobiles (equal to interest on the market\\nvalue of the car), in this case reducing the\\ndiscrimination against the use of public\\ntransit.\\nVI. Shifting Property Taxes from\\nImprovements to Land\\nA measure that could provide a powerful\\nstimulus to investment in property improve-\\nments would be to replace part or all of the\\nproperty tax by a tax on land value only, a\\nproposal that can be traced all the way back\\nto Franqois Quesnay and the French phys-\\niocrats but which is more recently associ-\\nated with the name of Henry George.

Nevertheless some means of\\nbringing pressure to bear on these govern-\\nments to make this change might be found.\\nSome Pennsylvania governments are already\\ndoing this. When levied for municipal pur-\\nposes, it might be appropriate to exempt\\nfrom the tax a flat amount per square foot\\nas representing the value of circumambient\\nagricultural land for which the urban gov-\\nernment can claim no credit; this would also\\nmitigate discriminations at jurisdictional\\nboundaries.\\nIt is perhaps worth noting that the signif-\\nicance of a government debt would be dras-\\ntically different in a community relying ex-\\nclusively on a land-value tax. Such a debt\\nwould in effect be a collective mortgage on\\nthe land, especially if it can be assumed that\\nland values in the community will vary pro-\\nportionately over time. Since the interest on\\nthe community debt will generally be lower\\nthan interest charged on individual mort-\\ngages, it can be in the general interest of all\\nthe taxpayers of the community for the gov-\\nernment to borrow as much as the market\\nwill take, even to finance current outlays,\\nprovided a suitable margin is left to deal\\nwith emergencies. On the other hand such\\ndebt financing performs no recycling of sav-\\nings, there is no room for Keynesian fiscal\\npolicy, and Ricardian equivalence is in full\\nsway. This does not detract, however, from\\nthe powerful stimulating effect of a reduc-\\ntion in the tax on improvements.\\nVII. Limitations of \"Supply-Side\" Measures\\nUnder current conditions, however, such\\n\"supply-side\" measures designed to operate\\nby reducing the cost of capital are likely to\\nbe severely limited in their effect as long as\\nnearly all types of capital facilities are idle\\nor underutilized. Very little \"widening\" in-\\nvestment is likely to take place as long as\\nthere is excess capacity in place. At most,\\nsome \"deepening\" investment in new prod-\\nucts or technologies may take place, or there\\nmay be corners of the economy where rela-\\ntively rapid growth has kept capacity fully\\nutilized. Even in such cases, investment in\\ncapital facilities may depend more on ap-\\npraisals of an uncertain market for the\\nproduct than on the cost of capital.\\nThis is likely to be true not only of tax\\npolicy but even more of monetary policy. In\\nany attempt to emerge from present rates of\\nunemployment even only down to the\\nNIARU within any reasonable time period,\\nmonetary policy is likely to prove a weak\\nreed, sometimes aptly described as pushing\\non a string. The main difficulty is that mon-\\netary policy bears primarily on short-term\\ninterest rates and credit availability and in\\nits usual practice does not directly control\\nlong-term rates, which are the important\\nrates for most decisions involving real\\ndurable capital formation. The posture of\\nthe Federal Reserve System in holding itself\\nready to slam on the brakes at the first sign\\nof resurgent inflation is poorly adapted to\\nbringing long-term rates down. It does not\\nappear that the Fed has either the will or\\nthe resources to do enough about long-term\\nrates to do very much to increase capital\\nformation, especially when idle and under-\\nused capacity pervades much of the econ-\\nomy.\\nVIII. Savings Recycling by Government\\nThis brings us inevitably around to fiscal\\npolicy. Here it is necessary to stop thinking\\nof the conventional nominal budget deficit,\\nor even of a current-account deficit in a\\nbudget drawn up in terms of distinguishing\\ncapital and current-account items, and to\\nstart thinking of fiscal policy in terms of its\\nrole in recycling savings, in excess of what is\\nrecycled by private investment, into the\\nstream of purchasing power. The conven-\\ntional wisdom seems to argue that increased\\nemployment requires that the economy\\ngrow, growth requires investment, and in-\\nvestment requires savings; therefore let\\'s\\nencourage saving through IRA\\'s, tax expen-\\nditure rather than income, and tighten our\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Savings are not\\nlike a sack of potatoes which if not sold at\\nthe current price will stay on hand and put\\na downward pressure on the price until sold.\\nSavings not immediately taken up to create\\ncapital simply vanish in reduced income,\\nwithout even exerting a downward pressure\\non interest rates. If I yield to the allure-\\nments of tax concessions to IRA\\'s to the\\npoint of not having my hair cut, this puts $8\\nmore in my bank account, but $8 less in the\\nbarber\\'s account; there is nothing that makes\\nit any easier for anyone to obtain funds with\\nwhich to create capital, nor anything that\\nmakes the prospect more attractive.

Nor would the sale of the Pen-\\ntagon, or the purchase of an office building\\ncurrently being rented by the government,\\noffset by bond transactions, involve any\\nchange in the level of recycling. Government\\nrecycling is in principle the excess of those\\ngovernment outlays that are regarded by\\ntheir recipients as income over those govern-\\nment receipts that are regarded by their\\npayors as reductions in their disposable in-\\ncome. Even this is subject to some caveats: if\\ngovernment investment in a power plant, for\\nexample, substitutes for investment that\\nwould otherwise have been made by private\\nenterprise, there is no net recycling.\\nOn the whole, however, recycling tends to\\nvary in rough correlation with the nominal\\ndeficit, and the strength of the notion in the\\nminds of the public and their representa-\\ntives that deficits are bad and that the\\n\"budget\" should be balanced may make it\\ndifficult to achieve an adequate level of\\nrecycling. Some help in this respect may be\\nobtained by going to a capital budget sys-\\ntem, in which balance would be sought only\\nfor the current-account part of the budget,\\nborrowing for the capital account being jus-\\ntified by comparisons with corresponding\\nprivate practices and by the thought that\\nfuture generations being burdened with the\\ndebt would also reap benefits from the capi-\\ntal passed on to them. While this may con-\\nstrain choice away from what rational voters\\nwould have chosen as the optimal level of\\ngovernment capital formation, there would\\nseem to be sufficient scope for government\\ncapital investment to provide sufficient recy-\\ncling to bring about full employment, partic-\\nularly if investments in education, research,\\nspace exploration, and the like are consid-\\nered eligible for treatment as capital invest-\\nment. Some of these projects, even if they\\nwould not stand scrutiny aside from their\\nfunction in justifying income recycling, may\\nnevertheless have the same kind of justifi-\\ncation as the building of the Egyptian pyra-\\nmids had for Keynes. On general welfare\\ngrounds, one might well prefer recycling in\\nterms of borrowing to finance health care to\\nborrowing to finance space stations, but if\\nborrowing for health care is deemed to cre-\\nate an ideologically sinful current-account\\ndeficit, space stations it will have to be.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'IX. The Need for Direct Inflation Control\\nLong before the economy reaches a really\\nsatisfactory level of full employment, how-\\never, as employment gets to the NIARU\\nlevel, and inflation threatens to accelerate,\\nthe Fed is likely to try to slam on the\\nbrakes, and demands for a more stringent\\nbudget balancing and cutback of \"govern-\\nment waste\" are likely to be heard in the\\nhalls of Congress. To get anywhere near a\\nsatisfactory level of unemployment, some\\nmethod of dealing with inflation will have to\\nbe devised. We are short of tools.\\nIn effect, the economy can be thought of\\nas having three major parameters that we\\nwould like to control: the level of employ-\\nment of human and other resources, the\\nprice level, and the division of the resulting\\ntotal product between provision for current\\nwants and investment in growth and the\\nfuture. At the same time, we have only two\\nmajor policy tools: monetary and fiscal pol-\\nicy. In an era when inflation was not a\\nthreat, one could think of these two tools as\\ncontrolling the level of employment and the\\nrate of growth, with low interest rates com-\\nbined with a deficit or surplus sufficient to\\nmaintain full employment leading to high\\ninvestment and growth, and conversely.\\nHowever, with a need to control inflation as\\nwell, relying on only two dimensions of con-\\ntrol is like trying to fly an airplane without\\nailerons, which were the third dimension of\\ncontrol that was the key to the success of\\nthe Wright brothers. A new tool is needed.\\nOver the past three decades a number of\\nproposals for direct control of inflation have\\nbeen made, but none has achieved general\\nacceptance. Wartime control of specific\\nprices, accompanied by rationing, was ac-\\ncepted as an emergency measure and\\nworked in part because of patriotic willing-\\nness to conform and in part because, being\\ntemporary, past prices could be continued\\nwithout becoming absurd. As a perma-\\nnent scheme this is probably unworkable\\nand certainly unacceptable. More recent\\nschemes have involved tax incentives of\\nvarious kinds to provide a countervailing\\ndownward pressure against the inherent\\ninflationary tendency of an imperfectly\\ncompetitive system. Such schemes have\\ngenerally suffered from difficulties in mea-\\nsuring price changes at an individual-firm\\nlevel, capriciousness of results when tied to\\nsuch taxes as the corporation income tax,\\nand possible time lags in adjusting the\\nstrength of the incentives to changing cir-\\ncumstances.\\nX. Market-Based Inflation-Control Plans\\nA few years ago David Colander came to\\nvisit me and reported on a proposal by\\nAbba Lerner for a market in rights to raise\\nprices. Those wishing to raise their prices\\nwould be required to purchase the right\\nfrom those prepared to lower their prices,\\nthus assuring a constant overall price level.\\nWhile this neatly circumvents the problem\\nof adjusting the strength of incentive to\\nchanging inflationary pressures, the prob-\\nlem remains of how to measure price\\nchanges in the face of quality changes, new\\nproducts, and variations in the terms of sale\\nsuch as delivery, reliability, service, credit\\nterms, tie-in sales, and the like.\\nMore pregnant was the question of how\\nto deal with cases in which prices paid to\\nsuppliers have risen. A somewhat similar\\nproblem arises with gross receipts taxes,\\nwhich discriminate in favor of vertically in-\\ntegrated operations and against situations in\\nwhich the product passes through several\\nhands on the way to the market. In Europe\\nthis problem has been solved by shifting\\nfrom gross receipts taxes and retail sales\\ntaxes to value-added taxes, which immedi-\\nately suggests that instead of a market in\\nrights to raise prices we have a market in\\nrights to value added.\\nXI. Control with Marketable Gross\\nMarkup Warrants\\nFor semantic reasons I have chosen to\\nspeak in terms of \"gross markups\" rather\\nthan value added, as being more suggestive\\nof something to be restrained rather than\\npromoted. In principle, gross markups sim-\\nply refers to the excess of sales revenue over\\namounts paid for nonprime inputs. In oper-\\nation, warrants for gross markups for a\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"prospective accounting period would be is-\\nsued to each firm on the basis of the gross\\nmarkups for a corresponding preceding pe-\\nriod, plus or minus adjustments for changes\\nin prime inputs such as labor and invested\\ncapital. These warrants would be issued in\\nsufficient total face value to correspond to\\nthe value at a desired price level of the\\noutput expected to be produced by the in-\\nputs against which the warrants were issued.\\nThey would be freely tradable for cash in a\\ncompetitive market, and if at the end of the\\naccounting period a firm is found to have\\nretained or acquired fewer warrants than\\nthe actual amount of its gross markups for\\nthe period, a penalty tax would be assessed.\\nThis tax would not be a substantial source\\nof revenue, but would serve merely as an\\nenforcement device. It could be set at a\\nlevel fairly certain to be higher than the\\nmarket price of the warrants.\\nAdjustment of the warrant issue for\\nchanges in investment could be made simply\\non the basis of a uniform percentage of\\nsuch change. Adjustment for changes in em-\\nployment is somewhat more difficult: a flat\\namount per employee or man-hour takes\\ntoo little account of variations in qualifica-\\ntions, while to allow adjustments equal to\\npayrolls would run a danger of allowing\\ninflationary wage increases. Some formula\\nsuch as a percentage of payrolls plus a flat\\namount per employee might be satisfactory;\\nsuch a formula would involve a certain bias\\nin favor of the employment of low-skill la-\\nbor, which may be considered desirable in\\nview of the fact that this is where the unem-\\nployment problem is most serious.\\nAdministration would seem to pose no\\ninsurmountable problems. Determination of\\ngross markups is essentially no different than\\nthe assessment of a value-added tax such as\\nis widespread in Europe. Adjustment for\\ninvestment can be made on the basis of\\naccounts already needed for income-tax\\npurposes, while adjustments for employ-\\nment can be related to the social-security\\nrecords. Some special methods may have to\\nbe developed for dealing with the self-\\nemployed and very small firms, and possibly\\nsome classes of firms could be excluded\\nfrom the scheme, as is sometimes done with\\nthe value-added tax.\\nXII. Prospects for Rapidly Reaching\\nGenuine Full Employment\\nWith such a scheme in place, what can we\\nplan for in terms of getting from where we\\nare to full employment? Currently unem-\\nployment is reported as about 7.5 percent,\\nand full employment can be reckoned at\\nabout 1.5 percent, giving a slack to be made\\nup of 6 percent. Using Okun's ratio of per-\\ncentage change in GNP to percentage\\nchange in reported unemployment of 2.5,\\nwe have a slack of 15 percent to be made\\nup. If this slack can be taken up within two\\nyears, this will be 7.5 percent per year; if to\\nthis we add 2.5 percent for growth in the\\nlabor force and in productivity, we get 10-\\npercent annual growth in GNP over two\\nyears. After two years, we hit the full-\\nemployment ceiling, and growth thereafter\\nwill be limited to the labor force and pro-\\nductivity factor, possibly between 2 percent\\nand 4 percent.\\nIs public finance up to the job of reaching\\nthe goals thus defined in terms of the limits\\nof our real resources? Possibly, but it re-\\nquires breaking new ground. One would\\nhave to begin with increasing government\\nrecycling as rapidly as possible by 8-10 per-\\ncent of GNP in order to inaugurate the\\n1.0-percent growth rate. How rapidly this\\ncould be done would of course depend on\\nthe political and legislative ambience. From\\nsome points of view the fastest and easiest\\nway to do this is by tax cuts. Unfortunately,\\nif tax cuts are temporary they tend to be\\nviewed as windfalls to be saved rather than\\nspent, so that only part of the tax cuts are\\neffectively recycled. Alternatively, if not an-\\nnounced as temporary, tax cuts tend to cre-\\nate a resistance to later tax increases called\\nfor by full-employment conditions and large\\ndebt-service requirements. This is especially\\nthreatening in the present context of politi-\\ncal campaigning on the basis of promises of\\nno new taxes. Perhaps the best tax cut would\\nbe a cut in the payroll taxes, as promising\\nthe maximum proportion of recycling, if this\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

There is also the need not to\\nget too far ahead of the effective operation\\nof whatever anti-inflation program is put in\\nplace, whether the program of gross markup\\nwarrants proposed above or some other, lest\\nanticipatory speculation and inflation get\\nout of hand. The exact program for the\\nstart-up period will require careful study.\\nWhat happens after the first few months\\nwill depend to a large extent on what Keynes\\ncalled the \"animal spirits\" of the financial\\ncommunity. At one extreme there could be\\nsuch horror and alarm at the violation of\\nthe conventional wisdom concerning the\\nsinfulness of deficits as to produce a\\nwidespread hibernation and flight to foreign\\nshores. More likely, once the financial com-\\nmunity has become convinced of the seri-\\nousness of the administration\\'s purpose to\\nbring about full employment, and once it is\\nanticipated that demand will shortly use up\\nthe spare capacity of existing productive\\nfacilities, private capital formation may pick\\nup to the point of absorbing and recycling\\nindividual savings sufficiently so that gov-\\nernment recycling may for the time being\\nbecome unnecessary. At the same time, gov-\\nernment revenues from increased GNP will\\nincrease and outlays for unemployment in-\\nsurance and welfare will decrease. Also,\\nthere may be a need to shut down those\\ngovernmental programs that compete for\\nreal resources with private capital forma-\\ntion, in order to avoid a real \"crowding out\"\\n(as contrasted with the financial crowding\\nout alleged to occur as a result of govern-\\nment borrowing associated with a tax cut).\\nAs a result, a brief period of budget balance\\nor even of surplus may become appropriate.\\nAs the economy hits the ceiling of full\\nemployment, however, still another transi-\\ntion becomes necessary. For a while capital\\nformation may continue on its momentum,\\nrecycling savings but producing excess ca-\\npacity that either cannot find labor with\\nwhich to operate or cannot find markets in\\nwhich to sell its product. Within a short\\ntime after hitting the full-employment ceil-\\ning, capital formation will have to drop from\\nthat appropriate to a 10-percent growth rate\\nto that suited to a far slower growth rate. At\\nthis point attempted savings may again ex-\\nceed what can be absorbed by private capi-\\ntal formation, even at very low rates of\\ninterest. Other ways to recycle the excess\\nwill again become necessary, one of which\\nwill be renewed government recycling.\\nXIII. Long-Term Excess of Demand Saving\\nover Private Investment\\nThere is, indeed, no principle of eco-\\nnomics that says that there will always be a\\nfeasible rate of interest that will equate\\ndesired savings and private capital-forma-\\ntion under conditions of steady full employ-\\nment. Current trends seem to be such as to\\nmake such a possibility unlikely. One factor\\nhas been a spate of capital-saving innova-\\ntions and practices. Fiber optics, when fully\\nutilized, costs less per unit of service than\\nprevious technologies by orders of magni-\\ntude, leaving ductways planned for copper\\nconductors forever surplus; electronic ex-\\nchanges occupy a fraction of the space\\nformerly required by equivalent electro-\\nmechanical exchanges; just-in-time practices\\nreduce investment in inventory; improved\\ncommunications enable more freight to be\\ncarried on a single track line with sidings\\nthan was formerly carried by a full two-track\\nline; a man assembling electronic gear with\\na soldering iron uses far less capital than\\nthe man in the pulpit of a rolling mill, and\\nservice industries generally use less capital\\nper employee than manufacturing, mining,\\nor transportation.\\nMoreover, before gross investment can\\nbegin to recycle private savings, it must first\\nrecycle funds set aside in depreciation,\\namortization, depletion, and obsolescence\\ncharges, while rapid obsolescence due to\\naccelerating technological progress makes\\ncapital formation relatively insensitive to\\nchanges in interest rates. Very low or nega-\\ntive interest rates may stimulate investment\\nin nondepreciating assets such as land, but\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'even this is limited by the possibility that\\nspeculative bubbles may burst, and in any\\ncase relatively little recycling is produced\\nthereby, except to the extent that the en-\\nhanced asset values cause owners to feel\\nwealthier and spend more.\\nOn the savings side, increased longevity\\nand the high cost of old-age illness lead to\\nincreased savings through funded pensions\\nand other provisions for retirement. For this\\npurpose, the lower the rate of interest, the\\ngreater is the amount of current savings that\\nmust be put aside to provide a given level of\\nretirement security. More recently the in-\\ncreased concentration of income among the\\nvery wealthy, who have a high propensity to\\nsave, not so much for eventual consumption\\nbut largely to accumulate chips with which\\nto play financial games and exercise eco-\\nnomic power, has further added to the sav-\\nings-recycling problem. Some recycling may\\ntake place through investment abroad, re-\\nflected in a positive trade balance and the\\nproduction of goods for export, though it is\\nuncertain how far this can be carried in the\\nface of political instability, the danger of\\ncreating repayment problems, and the resis-\\ntance of foreign governments that do not\\nhave an effective full-employment policy of\\ntheir own to our exporting our unemploy-\\nment to them in this way.\\nOn balance, it may prove impossible, for\\nthe foreseeable future, to maintain a steady\\nstate of genuinely full employment without\\na substantial amount of government recy-\\ncling of savings, a chronic budget deficit,\\nand a long-term increasing trend in the na-\\ntional debt, however distasteful this may be\\nto those ideologically addicted to a bal-\\nanced budget. It may even prove necessary\\nfor the debt to grow at a rate faster than the\\ngrowth of GNP. The burden of servicing\\nthis debt might be kept within bounds by\\nreducing real interest rates, close to zero if\\nneed be, though this might imply a higher\\nlevel of private investment than would be\\nchosen on its own merits. Even contemplat-\\ning such prospects calls for a significant\\nexpansion in our range of habitual thought.\\nXIV. The Task Before Us\\nThis, then, is the challenge I lay before\\nthe economics profession. There is no rea-\\nson inherent in the real resources available\\nto us why we cannot move rapidly within\\nthe next two or three years to a state of\\ngenuinely full employment and then con-\\ntinue indefinitely at that level. We would\\nthen enjoy a major reduction in the ills of\\npoverty, homelessness, sickness, and crime\\nthat this would entail. We might also see\\nless resistance to reductions in military ex-\\npenditure, to liberalization of trade and im-\\nmigration policy, and to conservation and\\nenvironmental protection programs.\\nI lay before you a plan I believe can\\naccomplish this. It involves government re-\\ncycling of excess savings plus a method of\\nkeeping inflation under control. I believe it\\ncan do the job while preserving the essen-\\ntials of a free-market system. There may be\\nsome details to be worked out, but I am\\nconfident that the basic concept is sound\\nand workable.\\nWe simply cannot carry on as we have\\nbeen doing without falling apart as a com-\\nmunity and losing what is left of our status\\nof world leadership. If you don\\'t think that\\nsomething like this can be made to work,\\nthen it is up to us to get together to find\\nsomething that will. Otherwise, if we con-\\ntinue to tie our hands with financial shibbo-\\nleths and models that tacitly assume a fixed\\ntotal of resource utilization, we are no bet-\\nter than the feckless castaway whose contri-\\nbution to the solution of the problem of\\ndealing with cases of canned goods was \"let\\'s\\njust assume we have a can-opener.\"\\n\\n###',\n",

But by\\nattributing it to technical change and other\\nsources of improved efficiency they turned\\nit, perhaps inadvertently, from a gap in our\\nunderstanding into an intellectual asset, a\\nmethod for measuring \"technical change.\"\\nStill, it was not a comfortable situation, and\\na subsequent literature developed trying to\\n\"explain\" this residual, or more precisely, to\\nattribute it to particular sources (Griliches\\n1960, 1963a,b, 1964; Edward Denison, 1962;\\nDale Jorgenson and Griliches, 1967). The\\nconsensus of that literature was that, while\\nmeasurement errors may play a significant\\nrole in such numbers, they could not really\\nexplain them away. The major sources of\\nproductivity growth were seen as coming\\nfrom improvements in the quality of labor\\nand capital and from other, not otherwise\\nmeasured, sources of efficiency and techni-\\ncal change, the latter being in turn the\\nproduct of formal and informal R&D in-\\nvestments by individuals, firms, and govern-\\nments, and the largely unmeasured contri-\\nbutions of science and other spillovers. The\\nprescription of additional investments in ed-\\nucation, in science, and in industrial R&D\\nfollowed from this reading of history as did\\nalso the hope and expectation that the re-\\ncently observed rates of \"technical change\"\\nwould continue into the future.\\nThis general view of the sources of growth\\nwas put into doubt by the events of the\\n1970\\'s and 1980\\'s. Beginning in 1974 (or\\nperhaps already in 1968) productivity growth\\nslowed down significantly in the United\\nStates and abroad, and it has not fully re-\\ncovered yet, at least as far as national aggre-\\ngates are concerned. The many explanations\\nthat were offered for these events were not\\nvery convincing (see e.g., Denison, 1979;\\nMartin Baily and Robert Gordon, 1988;\\nGriliches, 1988). As time went on and the\\ndirect effects of the energy-price shocks\\nwore off but the expected recovery did not\\ncome or came only weakly, more voices\\nwere heard arguing that the slowdown might\\nnot be temporary; that the energy-price\\nshocks just revealed what was already there\\n-a decline in the underlying trend of tech-\\nnical change in the world economy; that the\\ngrowth opportunities that had opened up in\\nthe late 1930\\'s and had been interrupted by\\nWorld War II have been exhausted, reflect-\\ning perhaps the completion of an even\\nlonger cycle, going back to the beginnings of\\nthis century (see e.g., Alfred Kleinknecht,\\n1987; Gordon, 1993a). Even more omi-\\nnously, the slowdown was blamed on dimin-\\nishing returns to science and technology in\\ngeneral and the onset of widespread socio-\\neconomic sclerosis (see e.g., William Nord-\\nhaus, 1972, 1989; Mancur Olsen, 1982;\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

I will also allude briefly to\\nsimilar issues which arise in interpreting the\\nproductivity contribution of computers in\\nthe economy. Parallel tales about data con-\\nstraining our understanding could also be\\ntold about other potential productivity-\\nslowdown villains: energy-price shocks, in-\\nsufficient investment in\\'physical capital, and\\npossible declines in human-capital invest-\\nments. Having reached the verdict of \"not\\nproven,\" largely on account of insufficient\\nevidence, I shall make a number of more\\ngeneral remarks on the state of our data\\nand the possible reasons for it. The major\\nmessage that I will be trying to convey is\\nthat we often misinterpret the available data\\nbecause of inadequate attention to how they\\nare produced and that the same inattention\\nby us to the sources of our data helps ex-\\nplain why progress is so slow. It is not just\\nthe measurement of productivity that is af-\\nfected. Other fields of empirical economics\\nare also struggling against the limitations\\nimposed by the available data. Great ad-\\nvances have been made in theory and in\\neconometric techniques, but these will be\\nwasted unless they are applied to the right\\ndata.\\nI. The \"Facts\"\\nThere are three sets of \"facts\" to look at:\\nwhat has happened to productivity, what\\nhas happened to investment in R&D and\\nscience, and what has happened to the rela-\\ntionship between them. Sometime in the\\nlate 1960\\'s measured productivity growth in\\nthe United States started to slow down.\\nAfter a mild recovery in the early 1970\\'s,\\nthe world economy was hit by two succes-\\nsive oil-price shocks which dropped eco-\\nnomic growth rates in most of the devel-\\noped economies to levels significantly below\\nthose experienced in the 1960\\'s and early\\n1970\\'s. While the effects of the oil-price\\nshocks wore off and real energy prices de-\\nclined to close to their earlier levels, pro-\\nductivity growth rates did not recover much.\\nAt this point, and also somewhat earlier,\\nmany observers started wondering whether\\nsomething more fundamental than just an\\nenergy-price-shock-induced business cycle\\nwas afoot. Standing in the early 1980\\'s and\\nlooking back at the recent past, one would\\nhave observed a decline in total patents\\ngranted in the United States beginning in\\nthe early 1970\\'s and a decline in the share\\nof GNP being devoted to industrial R&D\\nstarting in the mid-1960\\'s, the timing look-\\ning suspiciously appropriate for declining\\nproductivity growth rates 5-10 years later.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

First, the productivity-growth de-\\ncline in many other countries was larger,\\nabsolutely, than in the United States, and\\nthere it was not associated with declines in\\nR&D investment.2 Second, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1, the sectors where the productivity\\nslowdown has persisted in the United States\\nare largely outside of manufacturing, com-\\nmunications, and agriculture (see Gordon,\\n1987). Besides mining and public utilities,\\nwhich were affected more specifically by the\\nenergy-price shocks, it has lingered particu-\\nlarly in construction, finance, and other ser-\\nvices where output measurement is notori-\\nously difficult. Third, the decline in patent\\ngrants in the 1970's was just a bureaucratic\\nmirage, an example of fluctuations induced\\nby changes in the data-generating process (a\\nbudgetary crisis in the Patent Office) rather\\nthan a reflection of the underlying activity\\nitself.3 The number of patent applications\\ndid not decline significantly during this pe-\\nriod, but also it did not grow.

This\\nraised the specter of diminishing returns to\\nR&D and offered the hypothesis of \"ex-\\nhaustion of inventive opportunities\" as a\\npotential explanation for the productivity\\nslowdown.\\nThis hypothesis has been examined re-\\ncently by various authors. There are basi-\\ncally two styles of analysis: one focuses di-\\nrectly on the link, if any, between R&D and\\nproductivity growth (see e.g., Griliches,\\n1986a; Bronwyn Hall, 1993; Scherer, 1993),\\nwhile the other uses patents as indicators of\\nthe output of the R&D effort and looks at\\nwhat has happened to the \"knowledge-\\nproduction function\" (see e.g., Griliches,\\n1990; Ricardo Caballero and Adam Jaffe,\\n1993; Robert Evenson, 1993; Samuel\\nKortum, 1993). The bridge that is missing\\nbetween these two approaches would exam-\\nine the units in which patents affect produc-\\ntivity growth and ask whether they have\\nstayed constant over time. Without such\\nconstancy, no clear interpretation is possi-\\nble.\\nII. Productivity Growth and the Role of R&D\\nIn parallel to the aggregate \"residual\"\\nliterature, a more micro-oriented approach\\nhad developed. It took the study of techni-\\ncal change, diffusion, and the role of formal\\nR&D as its main challenge, with the hope\\nof bringing more of it within the realm of\\neconomic analysis, helping thereby also to\\nexplain some of this residual away. Using\\nmodern language, one can interpret Edwin\\nMansfield\\'s and my own early work on dif-\\nfusion and on the role of R&D in agricul-\\nture and manufacturing as trying to endoge-\\nnize as much of technical change as was\\npossible (Griliches, 1957, 1958, 1964;\\nMansfield, 1961, 1965). Other important\\ncontributors to this literature were Richard\\nNelson, Scherer, Jacob Schmookler, and\\nNestor Terleckyj. By expanding the notion\\nof capital to include also R&D capital and\\nestimating its effects, this literature docu-\\nmented the contribution of public and pri-\\nvate investments in R&D and their spillovers\\nto the growth of productivity.4 But the mag-\\nnitude of the estimated effects was modest,\\nnot enough to account for the bulk of the\\nobserved residual or the fluctuations in it\\n(Griliches, 1988). The experience here was\\nsimilar to other attempts to account for the\\nresidual, such as using \"embodiment\" theo-\\nries to magnify the potential effects of capi-\\ntal accumulation (Denison, 1962; Nelson,\\n1962) or looking for increasing returns to\\nscale (Griliches and Vidar Ringstad, 1972).\\nThese various effects are real and nonnegli-\\ngible, but not large enough.\\nThere is one other way of trying to make\\nsomething more out of the R&D story: the\\npossibility that the productivity impact of\\nR&D has declined over time-that the co-\\nefficients have changed.

       " 'fore I discuss it, I need to digress briefly\\nand remind you about the developments in\\ncomputer price measurement.\\nQuality change is the bane of price and\\noutput measurement. Until 1986, computer\\nprices were treated as unchanged in the\\nnational income accounts. It took 25 years\\nfor the recommendations of the Stigler\\ncommittee (Griliches, 1961; National Bu-\\nreau of Economic Research, 1961) to have a\\nnoticeable effect on official practice, but\\nwhen they did, they did it with a bang! In\\n1986 the Bureau of Economic Analysis\\n(BEA) introduced a new computer price\\nindex, based on hedonic regression meth-\\nods, into the national accounts and revised\\nthem back to 1972 (Rosanne Cole et al.,\\n1986).8 This index was falling by about 15\\npercent per year or more (as compared to\\nthe assumed value of zero before), and that\\nhad several major implications, including\\nthe fact that it made the apparent recovery\\nin manufacturing productivity in the 1980\\'s\\nmuch stronger, about one-third of the total\\ncoming from the introduction of this price\\nindex alone (Gordon, 1993b).\\nThere was nothing wrong with the price\\nindex itself. It was, indeed, a major advance,\\nand the BEA should be congratulated for\\nmaking it, but the way it was introduced\\ncreated some problems. First, it was a\\nunique adjustment. No other high-tech\\nproduct had received parallel treatment, and\\nthus it stuck out like a sore thumb. This had\\nthe unfortunate consequence that the pro-\\nductivity growth in the computer industry\\nitself was seriously overestimated, because\\nsome of its major inputs, such as semicon-\\nductors, were not similarly deflated. Second,\\nit was introduced into a framework with\\nfixed weights, wrecking havoc on it. Using\\nfixed 1982 weights and a sharply falling price\\nindex implied the absence of a \"real\" com-\\nputer industry in the early 1970\\'s and a very\\nrapid growth in its importance, leading to a\\nmore than doubling of the share of machin-\\nery in total manufacturing output by the\\n\\nlate 1980\\'s. This last problem has largely\\nbeen solved recently with the introduction\\nof \"benchmark-weighted\" estimates of gross\\ndomestic product (GDP) and the moving\\naway from fixed-weights national income ac-\\ncounting (Allan Young, 1992). But the first\\nproblem, the uniqueness of this adjustment\\nin the face of similar, though perhaps not as\\nextreme, problems elsewhere remains to\\nhaunt us.\\nWhat I have done in Figure 3 (and in row\\n3b of Table 1) is to adjust the estimated\\nTFP growth in the computer industry down-\\nward by deflating materials purchases in\\nthis industry, which to a significant extent\\nconsist of purchases of other computer com-\\nponents and semiconductors, by the same\\noutput price index. I have also substituted a\\nsimilar price index in the semiconductors\\n(electronic components) industry and also\\nadjusted the growth of TFP in the phar-\\nmaceuticals industry upward to reflect the\\nexclusion of price declines due to the intro-\\nduction of generics in the current measure-\\nment procedures. (I shall come back to\\ndiscuss this last adjustment later on.) So\\nadjusted, Figure 3 does not look all that\\n\\n###',\n",

It seems that the observed decline\\nin the R&D coefficients did not begin seri-\\nously until the latter half of the 1970\\'s, with\\nthe second oil-price shock and the rise in\\nthe dollar exchange rate. The abruptness of\\nthe decline argues against a \"supply-side\"\\nexplanation in terms of exhaustion of inven-\\ntive opportunities. It is more likely that the\\npeculiar aggregate shocks of that time went\\nagainst R&D-intensive industries: first, be-\\ncause they hit energy-intensive industries\\nsuch as chemicals and petroleum refining\\nmore severely; and second, because the sub-\\nsequent rise in value of the dollar and the\\nexpansion in imports that followed hit some\\nof the more high-tech R&D-intensive indus-\\ntries even harder, leading to declines in\\n\"competitiveness,\" losses of rents, and the\\nappearance of excess capacity. The subse-\\nquent rise in the R&D coefficients (if it did\\nin fact occur), the rise in corporate R&D\\ninvestments through most of the 1980\\'s, and\\nthe rise in patenting in, the late 1980\\'s (as\\nwe shall see), all argue against interpreting\\nthese coefficient movements as reflecting\\n\"real\" declines in the once and future\\n\"potency\" of R&D. What did happen,\\nthough, was a sharp widening of the differ-\\nential between social and private returns to\\nR&D. The internationalization of R&D, the\\nrise in the technical and entrepreneurial\\nskills of our competitors, and the sharp rise\\nin the dollar exchange rate in the mid-1980\\'s,\\nall combined to erode, rather rapidly, the\\nrents accruing to the earlier accumulated\\nR&D capital and to the technical-expertise\\npositions of many of our enterprises. This\\nrise in the rate of private obsolescence and\\nthe fall in the \"appropriability\" of R&D led\\nto sharp declines in both profitability and\\nreal product prices. The latter, if they were\\nactually reflected in the appropriate price\\nindexes, would show up as an increase in\\nproductivity, rather than a decline.\\nBefore accepting this inconclusive verdict,\\none still has to face the evidence of declin-\\ning patent-to-R&D ratios. Figure 4 plots\\ndomestic patent applications divided by to-\\ntal company-financed R&D expenditures in\\nU.S. industry (in 1972 dollars) and by the\\ntotal number of scientists and engineers in\\nindustry.

Patents: A Shrinking Yardstick?\\nTo decide whether we should be worried\\nby what is happening with the patent num-\\nbers we need to know what they measure.\\nSince I have discussed this at some length\\nelsewhere (Griliches, 1990), I will make only\\ntwo points here. First, the interpretation of\\nFigure 4 need not be pessimistic. Its mes-\\nsage may not be what meets the eye. And,\\nsecond, the meaning of both the numerator\\nand the denominators of the ratios plotted\\nin Figure 4 may have changed significantly\\nover time.\\nIf patents can be taken as indicators of\\ninvention, and if the value of an invention is\\nproportional to the size of its market (or\\neconomy), then the fact that their total\\nnumbers remained roughly constant over\\nlong time periods is consistent with nonde-\\nclining growth rates of output and overall\\nproductivity.10 If inventions are \"produced\"\\nby a combination of current R&D and the\\nexisting state of knowledge (incorporating\\nthe accumulated effects of science and\\nspillovers from the previous research activi-\\nties of others), and if R&D is invested ap-\\nproximately \"optimally,\" then under rea-\\nsonable assumptions, a rise (or fall) in the\\nunderlying knowledge stock will affect them\\nboth in parallel fashion and will leave their\\nratio unchanged.1\" There will be, therefore,\\nno evidence in this ratio on the underlying\\nstate of the \"stock of knowledge.\" More-\\nover, it will be declining with growth in the\\nsize of the market, since a rise in the value\\nof inventions will push R&D up until pres-\\nent costs equal again the present value of\\nfuture (private) returns.\\nThe rate of growth of domestic patents\\nwas close to zero during the last three\\ndecades. That by itself should not be worri-\\nsome. If their average value had been grow-\\ning at the same rate as the economy as a\\nwhole, there would be no reason for us to\\nworry about it. But there were long periods\\nwhen the actual numbers were worse than\\nthat. During 1965-1985 the number of do-\\nmestic patent applications declined by - 0.6\\npercent per year while company-financed\\nR&D expenditures were growing by 4.8 per-\\ncent per year, in constant prices.

       " 'likely, unless the relationship between in-\\nventions and the number of patents applied\\nfor has been changing.\\nThe suspicion that the relationship be-\\ntween the number of patents and the num-\\nber of inventions (weighted by their relative\\neconomic importance) has been changing is\\nnot new. Schmookler (1966) stops most of\\nhis analysis with pre-World War II data,\\nbelieving that the meaning of the patent\\nstatistics changed at that time. What needs\\nto be reconciled in the data is the sharp\\ncontrast between the rapidly growing R&D\\nseries during 1953-1968 (and earlier) and\\nthe essentially flat patent series. There are a\\nnumber of not mutually exclusive possibili-\\nties here:\\n(i) The fast-growing R&D expenditures,\\nfueled by the new global opportunities\\nthat opened up in the post-World War\\nII period, were being invested in face\\nof rapidly diminishing returns.\\n(ii) Some of the observed growth in R&D\\ncould be spurious, the result of reclas-\\nsification of informal technological ac-\\ntivities into formal R&D under the\\npressure of tax accountants, public-\\nrelations experts, and R&D tax credits.\\n(iii) The rise of formal R&D-based inven-\\ntion crowded out smaller, less valuable\\nindividual-inventor-based patents, while\\nthe rise in the cost of patenting (in\\nterms of the time costs of dealing with\\nthe patent system) and the more recent\\nsharp rise in fees may have selected out\\na large number of potentially low-val-\\nued patents. Given the evidence that\\nthe value distribution of inventions and\\npatents is extremely skewed, with only\\na small fraction having a high present\\nvalue, such a crowding out could raise\\naverage values significantly, though the\\nrequired rate is rather on the high\\nside.12  It is also likely that the threshold for what\\nis patentable has risen, given the large in-\\nflux of foreign patent applications into the\\nU.S. system all impinging on a relatively\\nslow-growing and budget-constrained pat-\\nent office.\\'3 On the other hand, the legal\\nstatus of patents in the United States has\\nimproved significantly with the creation of a\\nspecial patents court, driving up the ex-\\npected private value of a patent.

What is it about the recent situa-\\ntion that has made matters worse?\\nThe brief answer is that the economy has\\nchanged and that our data-collection efforts\\nhave not kept pace with it. \"Real\" national\\nincome accounts were designed in an earlier\\nera, when the economy was simpler and had\\na large agricultural sector and a growing\\nmanufacturing sector. Even then, a number\\nof compromises had to be made to get mea-\\nsurement off the ground.

From one-third to over\\nhalf of all industrial R&D is \"sold\" to the\\ngovernment, either in the form of research\\ncontracts and prototypes or indirectly in the\\nform of weapons and space equipment, and\\nits direct productivity effects do not show up\\nin the data at all.

Currently, new goods\\nare introduced into the various official price\\nindexes rather slowly. While attempts are\\nbeing made to reduce the revision cycle in\\nthe producer price index from five to two\\nyears for some of the more high-tech goods,\\nthis may still not be fast enough. In the\\npersonal-computers market, for example,\\nthe life of a model has recently fallen to a\\nyear or less (Berndt et al., 1993).\\nDealing with the quality-change problem\\nby treating every version of a product sold\\nto a different type of customer as a separate\\ncommodity, as is currently the predominant\\nofficial practice, creates its own problems.\\nBy linking out the decline in prices experi-\\nenced by consumers in their shift to super-\\nmarkets, discount stores, and mail-order\\npurchases, it underestimates significantly not\\nonly the output of se;rvices, but also the\\noutput of some of the more \"standard\"\\nmanufacturing industries (Marshall Reins-\\ndorf, 1993). A prime example of that is the\\ntreatment of generics in the pharmaceutical\\nprice indexes. The stylized facts are as fol-\\nlows:\\n(i) Generics are introduced at roughly half\\nthe price of the original brand.\\n(ii) The brand price, however, does not,\\ndecline (it sometimes even goes up),\\nwith the ex-monopolist depreciating\\noptimally her original position and with\\ngenerics gaining between half and\\nthree-quarters of the market for the\\nparticular drug.\\n(iii) But because generic versions are\\ntreated as separate commodities, in\\nspite of what the FDA says, the price\\nindex does not fall, and since the value\\nof shipments declines as the market\\nshifts to generics (and to hospital and\\nHMO formularies), so does measured\\n\"output\" in this industry and the asso-\\nciated productivity measures (Griliches\\nand lain Cockburn, 1993).\\nThis might explain the rather strange\\nfact that during the last decade pharma-\\nceuticals, an industry with one of the high-\\nest R&D-sales ratios, had a rather dismal\\nproductivity-growth performance. This was\\nthe period with an increasing penetration of\\ngenerics, which should have reduced mea-\\nsured prices in this industry but did not.\\nThe measurement environment has dete-\\nriorated also in other ways. There is less\\nwillingness on the part of firms and con-\\nsumers to respond to detailed questions,\\nand our government has done little to em-\\nphasize the importance of good economic\\ndata to its own functioning or the overall\\nunderstanding of our economy.

The Glass Half-Full?\\nAfter a long detour I come back to the\\noriginal question: why don\\'t we know more\\nabout the sources of productivity growth\\nand the causes for its recent slowdown?\\nWhy does it feel as if the glass is still\\nhalf-empty? First note that in a trivial sense\\nwe are doing better: the residual is smaller.\\nBut that is the bad news, not the good. It is\\nsmaller not because we have succeeded in\\nproviding a substantively fuller explanation\\nof output growth, but rather because mea-\\nsured output growth declined, leaving some\\nof these explanations in the dust. But we\\nare also doing better substantively. We know\\nmuch more about the components of growth\\nand where our measures are lacking. After\\ndecades of work and contributions by Deni-\\nson, Jorgenson, Kendrick, and many others,\\nthe conceptual and measurement underpin-\\nnings of the growth accounts are in much\\nbetter shape today. We now have extensive\\nmicro data on firms, their productivity, their\\nR&D expenditures, and other variables. We\\nhave more data on individual investments in\\neducation and training, and we also have\\nmore asset detail on capital formation. More\\ninternational data are now available, with\\nthe OECD both collecting R&D data and\\ncomputing TFP numbers for many coun-\\ntries, and with Summers and Heston (1991)\\nproviding comparable real GNP numbers\\nfor many countries. Finally, we have much\\nmore computing power and better econo-\\nmetric techniques and frameworks for at-\\ntacking many of the problems that arise in\\nthe analysis of such data. So what is still\\nmissing?\\nWe are caught up in a mixture of unmea-\\nsurement, mismeasurement, and unrealistic\\nexpectations. The productivity situation is\\nboth better than we think and also worse. It\\nis likely that there have been significant\\nunmeasured productivity advances in many\\nof the service sectors (Bresnahan, 1986;\\nBaily and Gordon, 1988). Moreover, rising\\nR&D investment rates in the mid-1980\\'s\\nand the recent rise in the number of patent\\napplications augur well for the future. Also,\\nproductivity growth rates are probably un-\\nderestimated even in the \"measurable\" sec-\\ntors because they are based on \"book value\"\\nestimates of physical- and human-capital\\nstocks and do not reflect the capital losses\\n-the obsolescence that occurred, first as\\nthe result of the various energy-price shocks,\\nand later as the result of increased interna-\\ntional competition and the melting away of\\nmuch of the previously existing monopoly\\nrents to both types of capital. That is actu-\\nally bad news. We are not as wealthy as we\\nthought, but productivity growth, based on\\nthe lower remaining levels of input, is prob-\\nably higher than we have measured it.\\nA cautionary remark needs to be added\\nhere: productivity growth contributes to the\\npotential for welfare, but it is not the same\\nthing. Welfare can move in the opposite\\ndirection if the resources released by pro-\\nductivity growth do not find adequate em-\\nployment in other, economically valuable,\\nactivities (including leisure). Also the physi-\\ncal, economic, and political environments\\ncan change, both positively and negatively,\\noverwhelming the productivity story.23 So\\neven though I have been focusing on it here\\ntonight, it is not the be-all of economic\\nwelfare.

Buchanan was\\nperhaps \"the first commentator to interpret\\nArrow\\'s impossibility theorem as the result\\nof a mistaken attempt to impose the logic of\\nwelfare maximization on the procedures of\\ncollective choice\" (Robert Sugden, 1993 p.\\n1948). But in addition, he was arguing that\\nthere was a deep \"confusion surrounding\\nthe Arrow analysis\" (not just the impossibil-\\nity theorem but the entire framework used\\nby Arrow and his followers) which ensued\\nfrom the mistaken idea of \"social or collec-\\ntive rationality in terms of producing results\\nindicated by a social ordering\" (Buchanan,\\n1960 pp. 88-89). We certainly have to exam-\\nine whether Buchanan\\'s critique negates the\\nimpossibility results, but we must also inves-\\ntigate the more general issues raised by\\nBuchanan.4\\nThird, Buchanan\\'s reasoned questioning\\nof the idea of \"social preference\" suggests,\\nat the very least, a need for caution in\\nimposing strong \"consistency properties\" in\\nsocial choice, but his emphasis on proce-\\ndural judgments may be taken to suggest,\\nmuch more ambitiously, that we should\\nabandon altogether consequence-based\\nevaluation of social happenings, opting in-\\nstead for a procedural approach. In its pure\\nform, such an approach would look for\\n\"right\" institutions rather than \"good\" out-\\ncomes and would demand the priority of\\nappropriate procedures (including the ac-\\nceptance of what follows from these proce-\\ndures). This approach, which is the polar\\nopposite of the welfare-economic tradition\\nbased on classical utilitarianism of founding\\nevery decision on an ordering of different\\nstates of affairs (treating procedures just as\\ninstruments to generate good states), has\\nnot been fully endorsed by Buchanan him-\\nself, but significant work in that direction\\nhas occurred in public choice theory and in\\nother writings influenced by Buchanan\\'s\\nwork (most notably, in the important contri-\\nbutions of Robert Sugden [1981, 1986]).\\nThis contrast is particularly important in\\ncharacterizing rights in general and liberties\\nin particular. In the social choice literature,\\nthese characterizations have typically been\\nin terms of states of affairs, concentrating\\non what happens vis-a-vis what the per-\\nson wanted or chose to do. In contrast, in\\nthe libertarian literature, inspired by the\\npioneering work of Robert Nozick (1974),\\nand in related contributions using \"game-\\nform\" formulations (most notably, by Wulf\\nGaertner, Pattanaik, and Suzumura [1992]),\\nrights have been characterized in procedu-\\nral terms, without referring to states of af-\\nfairs. We have to examine how deep the\\ndifferences between the disparate formula-\\ntions are, and we must also scrutinize their\\nrespective adequacies.\\nFourth, the prospects of rationality in so-\\ncial decisions must be fundamentally condi-\\ntional on the nature of individual rational-\\nity. There are many different conceptions of\\nrational behavior of the individual. There is,\\nfor example, the view of rationality as canny\\nmaximization of self-interest (the presump-\\ntion of human beings as \"homo economicus,\"\\nused in public choice theory, fits into this\\nframework). Arrow\\'s (1951) formulation is\\nmore permissive; it allows social considera-\\ntions to influence the choices people make.\\nIndividual preferences, in this interpreta-\\ntion reflect \"values\" in general, rather than\\nbeing based only on what Arrow calls\\n\"tastes\" (p. 23). How adequate are the re-\\nspective characterizations of individual ra-\\ntionality, and through the presumption of\\nrational behavior (shared by most economic\\n\\n###',\n",

Social choice theory has tended\\nto avoid this issue, following Arrow\\'s own\\nabstinence: \"we will also assume in the pre-\\nsent study that individual values are taken\\nas data and are not capable of being altered\\nby the nature of the decision process itself\"\\n(Arrow, 1951 p. 7).5 On this subject,\\nBuchanan has taken a more permissive po-\\nsition-indeed emphatically so: \"The defi-\\nnition of democracy as \\'government by dis-\\ncussion\\' implies that individual values can\\nand do change in the process of decision-\\nmaking\" (Buchanan, 1954a p. 120).6 We\\nhave to scrutinize the importance of this\\ndifference as well.\\nThis is a long and somewhat exacting list,\\nbut the different issues relate to each other,\\nand I shall try to examine them briefly and\\nalso comment on some of their practical\\nimplications.\\nII. Social Welfare Judgments and Arrow\\'s\\nImpossibility Theorem\\nThe subject of welfare economics was\\ndominated for a long time by the utilitarian\\ntradition, which performs interpersonal ag-\\ngregation through the device of looking at\\nthe sum-total of the utilities of all the peo-\\nple involved. By the 1930\\'s, however,\\neconomists came to be persuaded by argu-\\nments presented by Lionel Robbins (1938)\\nand others (influenced by the philosophy of\\n\"logical positivism\") that interpersonal\\ncomparisons of utility had no scientific\\nbasis.7 Thus, the epistemic foundations of\\nutilitarian welfare economics were seen as\\nincurably defective.\\nBecause of the eschewal of interpersonal\\ncomparability of individual utilities, the\\n\"new welfare economics\" that emerged tried\\nto rely only on one basic criterion of social\\nimprovement, the Pareto criterion. Since\\nthis confines the recognition of a social im-\\nprovement only to the case in which every-\\none\\'s utility goes up (or someone\\'s goes up\\nand no one\\'s goes down), it does not require\\nany interpersonal comparison, nor for that\\nmatter, any cardinality of individual utili-\\nties. However, Pareto efficiency can scarcely\\nbe an adequate condition for a good society.\\nIt is quite insensitive to the distribution of\\nutilities (including inequalities of happiness\\nand miseries), and it takes no direct note of\\nanything other than utilities (such as rights\\nor freedoms) beyond their indirect role in\\ngenerating utilities. There is a need, cer-\\ntainly, for further criteria for social welfare\\njudgments.\\nThe demands of orderly, overall judg-\\nments of \"social welfare\" (or the general\\ngoodness of states of affairs) were clarified\\nby Abram Bergson (1938, 1966) and exten-\\nsively explored by Paul Samuelson (1947).\\nThe concentration was on the need for a\\nreal-valued function W of \"social welfare\"\\ndefined over all the alternative social states,\\nor at least an aggregate ordering R over\\nthem, the so-called \"social preference.\" In\\nthe reexamination that followed the Berg-\\nson-Samuelson initiative (including the de-\\nvelopment of social choice theory as a disci-\\npline), the search for principles underlying a\\nsocial welfare function played a prominent\\npart.\\nArrow (1951) defined a \"social welfare\\nfunction\" as a functional relation that speci-\\nfies a social ordering R over all the social\\nstates for every set of individual preference\\norderings.

Here too an ag-\\ngregation is involved, since an individual\\nwho is making judgments about social wel-\\nfare, or about the relative goodness of dis-\\ntinct social states, must somehow combine\\nthe diverse interests and preferences of dif-\\nferent people.\\nBuchanan\\'s objection is quite persuasive\\nfor the first interpretation (involving deci-\\nsion mechanisms), especially since there is\\nno a priori presumption that the mecha-\\nnisms used must -or even should -neces-\\nsarily lead to choices that satisfy the re-\\nquirements of binary representation (not to\\nmention the more exacting demands of an\\nordering representation).12 On the other\\nhand, the second interpretation does not\\ninvolve this problem, and even an individual\\nwhen expressing a view about social welfare\\nneeds a concept of this kind.13 When ap-\\nplied to the making of social welfare judg-\\nments by an individual or an agency, Arrow\\'s\\nimpossibility theorem thus cannot be dis-\\nputed on the ground that some organic exis-\\ntence is being imputed to the society. The\\namelioration of impossibility must be sought\\nelsewhere (see Section IV). However,\\nBuchanan\\'s critique of Arrow\\'s theorem\\nwould apply to mechanisms of social deci-\\nsion (such as voting procedures).\\nWould the dropping of the requirement\\nthat social choices be based on a binary\\nrelation-in particular a transitive ordering\\n-negate the result in the case of social\\ndecision mechanisms? A large literature has\\nalready established that the arbitrariness of\\npower, of which Arrow\\'s case of dictator-\\nship is an extreme example, lingers in one\\nform or another even when transitivity is\\ndropped, so long as some regularity is de-\\nmanded (such as the absence of cycles).\\'4\\nThere is, however, cause for going further,\\nprecisely for the reasons identified by\\nBuchanan, and to eschew not just the tran-\\nsitivity of social preference, but the idea of\\nsocial preference itself. All that is needed\\nfrom the point of view of choice is that the\\ndecision mechanisms determine a \"choice\\nfunction\" for the society, which identifies\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Would the conditions relating individ-\\nual preferences to social choice (i.e., the\\nPareto principle, nondictatorship, and inde-\\npendence) then be consistent with each\\nother? The answer, in fact, is no, not so. If\\nthe Pareto principle and the conditions of\\nnondictatorship and independence are re-\\ndefined to take full note of the fact that\\nthey must relate to social choices, not to any\\nprior notion of social preference, then a very\\nsimilar impossibility reemerges (see Theo-\\nrem 3 in Sen [1993]).\\nHow does this \"general choice-functional\\nimpossibility theorem\" work? The underly-\\ning intuition is this. Each of the conditions\\nrelating individual preferences to social de-\\ncisions eliminates-either on its own or in\\nthe presence of the other conditions-the\\npossibility of choosing some alternatives.\\nAnd the conjunction of these conditions can\\nlead to an empty choice set, making it \"im-\\npossible\" to choose anything.\\nFor example, the Pareto principle is just\\nsuch a condition, and the object of this\\ncondition in a choice context, surely, is to\\navoid the selection of a Pareto-inferior al-\\nternative. Therefore this condition can be\\nsensibly redefined to demand that if every-\\none prefers x to y, then the social decision\\nmechanism should be such that y should\\nnot get chosen if x is available.17 Indeed, to\\neliminate any possibility that we are implic-\\nitly or indirectly using any intermenu consis-\\ntency condition for social choice, we can\\ndefine all the conditions for only one given\\nmenu (or opportunity set) S; that is, we can\\nconsider the choice problem exclusively over\\na given set of alternative states. The Pareto\\nprinciple for that set S then only demands\\nthat if everyone prefers some x to some y\\nin that set, then y must not be chosen from\\nthat set.\\nSimilarly, nondictatorship would demand\\nthat there be no person such that whenever\\nshe prefers any x to any y in that set S,\\nthen y cannot be chosen from that set.\\nWhat about independence? We have to\\nmodify the idea of decisiveness of a group\\nin this choice context, related to choices\\nover this given set S. A group would be\\ndecisive for x against y if and only if,\\nwhenever all members of this group prefer\\nany x to any y in this set S, then y is not to\\nbe chosen from S.

It is important to distinguish the\\nbearing of the problem in the making of\\naggregative social welfare judgments, as op-\\nposed to the operation of social decision\\nmechanisms. I start with the former.\\nIt may be recalled that the Bergson-\\nSamuelson analysis and Arrow\\'s impossibil-\\nity theorem followed a turn in welfare eco-\\nnomics that had involved the dropping of\\ninterpersonal comparisons of utility. As it\\nhappens, because of its utilitarian form, tra-\\nditional welfare economics had informa-\\ntional exclusions of its own, and it had been\\nopposed to any basic use of nonutility infor-\\nmation, since everything had to be judged\\nultimately by utility sum-totals in conse-\\nquent states of affairs. To this was now\\nadded the exclusion of interpersonal com-\\nparisons of utilities, without removing the\\nexclusion of nonutility information. This\\nbarren informational landscape makes it\\nhard to arrive at systematic judgments of\\nsocial welfare. Arrow\\'s theorem can be in-\\nterpreted, in this context, as a demonstra-\\ntion that even some very weak conditions\\nrelating individual preferences to social wel-\\nfare judgments cannot be simultaneously\\nsatisfied given this informational privation.19\\nThe problem is not just one of impossibil-\\nity. Consider the Field-Expansion Lemma:\\ndecisiveness over any pair of alternatives en-\\ntails decisiveness over every pair of alterna-\\ntives, irrespective of the nature of the states\\ninvolved. Consider three divisions of a given\\ncake between two persons: (99,1), (50,50),\\nand (1, 99). Let us begin with the assumption\\nthat each person-as homo economicus -\\nprefers a larger personal share of the cake. So\\nthey happen to have opposite preferences.\\nConsider now the ranking of (99,1) and\\n(50, 50). If it is decided that (50, 50) is better\\nfor the society than (99,1), then in terms of\\npreference-based information, person 2\\'s\\npreference is getting priority over person l\\'s.\\nA variant of the Field-Expansion Lemma\\nwould then claim that person 2\\'s preference\\nmust get priority over all other pairs as well,\\nso that even (1,99) must be preferred to\\n(50, 50).20 Indeed, it is not possible, given\\nthe assumptions, to regard (50, 50) as best of\\nthe three; we could either have (99,1), giv-\\ning priority to person l\\'s preference, or\\n(1,99), giving priority to 2\\'s preference. But\\nnot (50, 50). I am not arguing here that\\n(50,50) must necessarily be taken to be the\\nbest, but it is absurd that we are not even\\npermitted to consider (50,50) as a claimant\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

First, it might seem good to divide the\\ncake equally on some general non-welfarist\\nground, without even going into preferences\\nor utilities. This is not permitted because of\\n-the exclusion of evaluative use of nonutility\\ninformation, and this is what the Field-\\nExpansion Lemma is formalizing. Second,\\npresuming that everyone has the same\\nstrictly concave utility function, we might\\nthink that the sum-total of utilities would be\\nmaximized by an equal division of the cake.\\nBut this utilitarian argument involves com-\\nparability of cardinal utilities, which is ruled\\nout. Third, we might think that equal divi-\\nsion of the cake will equate utilities, and\\nthere are arguments for utility-centered\\negalitarianism (see James Meade, 1976). But\\nthat involves interpersonal comparison of\\nordinal utilities, which too is ruled out. None\\nof the standard ways of discriminating be-\\ntween the alternative states is viable in this\\ninformational framework, and the only way\\nto choose between them is to go by the\\npreference of one person or another (since\\nthey have opposite preferences).\\nTo try to make social welfare judgments\\nwithout using any interpersonal comparison\\nof utilities, and without using any nonutility\\ninformation, is not a fruitful enterprise.

While it is also the\\ncase that the critique of James Buchanan\\n(and others) of the idea of \"social rational-\\nity\" and the concept of \"social preference\"\\napplies particularly in this case (that of\\njudging social decision mechanisms), the im-\\npossibility problem does indeed survive, as\\nwe have seen, even when the concept of\\nsocial preference is eschewed and the idea\\nof social rationality in the Arrovian form is\\ndropped altogether (Section III). How, then,\\ncan we respond to the challenge in this\\ncase?\\nWe may begin by noting that the condi-\\ntions formulated and used by Arrow, while\\nappealing enough, are not beyond criticism.\\nFirst, not every conceivable combination of\\nindividual preferences need be considered\\nin devising a social decision procedure, since\\nonly some would come up in practice. As\\nArrow had himself noted, if the condition of\\nunrestricted domain is relaxed, we can find\\ndecision rules that satisfy all the other con-\\nditions (and many other demands) over sub-\\nstantial domains of individual preference\\nprofiles.

I shall also presently ques-\\ntion whether this presumption of process-\\nindependence is the right way of seeing the\\nclaims of social choice theory. Second, can\\nwe do the converse of this, and judge proce-\\ndures adequately in a consequence-indepen-\\ndent way? This issue I take up first.\\nSugden (1981, 1986), who has extensively\\nanalyzed this dichotomy (between procedu-\\nral and consequence-based views), explains\\nthat in the public choice approach, which he\\nsupports, \"the primary role of the govern-\\nment is not to maximize the social good, but\\nrather to maintain a framework of rules\\nwithin which individuals are left free to\\npursue their own ends\" (Sugden, 1993\\np. 1948). This is indeed so, but even in\\njudging a \"framework of rules\" in this way,\\nwe do need some consequential analysis,\\ndealing with the effectiveness of these\\nframeworks in letting individuals be actually\\n\"free to pursue their own ends.\" In an\\ninterdependent world, examples of permis-\\nsive rules that fail to generate the freedom\\nto pursue the respective individual ends are\\nnot hard to find (see Sen, 1982b).\\nIndeed, it is not easy to believe that the\\npublic-choice approach is-or can be-\\nreally consequence-independent. For exam-\\nple, Buchanan\\'s support of market systems\\nis based on a reading of the consequences\\nthat the market mechanism tends to pro-\\nduce, and consequences certainly do enter\\nsubstantially in Buchanan\\'s evaluation of\\nprocedures: \"To the extent that voluntary\\nexchange among persons is valued positively\\nwhile coercion is valued negatively, there\\nemerges the implication that substitution of\\nthe former for the latter is desired, on the\\npresumption, of course, that such substitu-\\ntion is technologically feasible and is not\\nprohibitively costly in resources\" (Buchanan,\\n1986 p. 22). While this is not in serious\\nconflict with Buchanan\\'s rejection of any\\n\"transcendental\" evaluation of the out-\\ncomes (p. 22), nevertheless the assessment\\nof outcomes must, in some form, enter this\\nevaluative exercise. 32\\nThere are, however, other-more purely\\nprocedural-systems to be found in this lit-\\nerature. If the utilitarian tradition of judg-\\ning everything by the consequent utilities is\\none extreme in the contrast (focusing only\\non a limited class of consequences), Nozick\\'s\\n(1974) elegant exploration of libertarian\\n\"entitlement theory\" comes close to the\\nother end (focusing on the right rules that\\ncover personal liberties as well as rights of\\nholding, using, exchanging, and bequeathing\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Parts of the\\nliterature that deal with comparisons of de-\\ncision mechanisms in arriving at given states\\nwould need modification. If, in general, pro-\\ncesses leading to the emergence of a social\\nstate were standardly included in the char-\\nacterization of that state, then we have to\\nconstruct \"equivalence classes\" to ignore\\nsome differences (in this case, between some\\nantecedent processes) to be able to discuss\\ncogently the \"same state\" being brought\\nabout by different decision mechanisms.

This has\\nbeen followed by important constructive\\ncontributions by Gardenfors (1981) and\\nSugden (1981), and the approach has been\\nextended and developed into game-form\\nformulations by Gaertner et al. (1992). In\\nthe game-form view, each of the players has\\na set of permissible strategies, and the out-\\ncome is a function of the combination of\\nstrategies chosen by each of the players\\n(perhaps qualified by an additional \"move\"\\nby \"nature\"). The liberties and rights of the\\ndifferent persons are defined by specifying a\\npermissible subset from the product of the\\nstrategy sets of the different individuals. A\\nperson can exercise his rights as he likes,\\nsubject to the strategy combination belong-\\ning to the permissible set.\\nIn defining what rights a person has, or in\\nchecking whether his rights were respected,\\nthere is, on this account, no need to exam-\\nine or evaluate the resulting state of affairs,\\nand no necessity to examine what states the\\nindividuals involved prefer. In contrasting\\nthis characterization of preference-indepen-\\ndent, consequence-detached rights with the\\nsocial choice approach to rights, perhaps\\nthe central question that is raised is the\\nplausibility of making people\\'s putative\\nrights, in general, so dissociated from the\\neffects of exercising them. This is a general\\nissue that was already discussed at a broader\\nlevel (Section VI).\\nIn some contexts, the idea of seeing rights\\nin the form of permission to act can be\\nquite inadequate, particularly because of\\n\"choice inhibition\" that might arise from a\\nvariety of causes. The long British discus-\\nsion on the failure of millions of potential\\nwelfare recipients from making legitimate\\nclaims (apparently due to the shame and\\nstigma of having one\\'s penury publicized\\nand recorded) illustrates a kind of nonreal-\\nization of rights in which permission is not\\nthe main issue at all.4\\' Similarly, the inabil-\\nity of women in traditionally sexist societies\\nto use even those rights that have not been\\nformally denied to them also illustrates a\\ntype of rights failure that is not helpfully\\nseen in terms of game forms (see Sen, 1992b\\npp. 148-50). Even the questions that stan-\\ndardly come up in this country in determin-\\ning whether a rape has occurred have to go\\nwell beyond checking whether the victim in\\nquestion was \"free\" to defy.\\nLeaving out such cases, it might well be\\nplausible to argue that rights can be nicely\\ncharacterized by game forms in many situa-\\ntions. However, even when that is the case,\\nin deciding on what rights to protect and\\ncodify, and in determining how the underly-\\ning purpose might be most effectively\\nachieved, there is a need to look at the\\nlikely consequences of different game-form\\nspecifications and to relate them to what\\npeople value and desire. If, for example, it\\nappears that not banning smoking in certain\\ngatherings (leaving the matter to the discre-\\ntion of the people involved) would actually\\nlead to unwilling victims having to inhale\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'other people\\'s smoke, then there would be\\na case for considering that the game-form\\nbe so modified that smoking is simply\\nbanned in those gatherings. Whether or not\\nto make this move must depend crucially on\\nconsequential analysis. The object, in this\\ncase, is the prevention of the state of affairs\\nin which nonsmokers have to inhale unwill-\\ningly other people\\'s smoke: a situation they\\nresent and which-it is assumed-they\\nhave a right to avoid. We proceed from\\nthere, through consequential analysis (in an\\n\"inverse\" form: from consequences to\\nantecedents), to the particular game-form\\nformulation that would not achieve an\\nacceptable result. The fact that the arti-\\nculation of the game-form would be\\nconsequence-independent and preference-\\nindependent is not a terribly profound as-\\nsertion and is quite consistent with the fun-\\ndamental relevance of consequences and\\npreferences.\\nThe contrast between game-form formu-\\nlations and social-choice conceptions of\\nrights is, thus, less deep than it might first\\nappear (see Sen, 1992b).42 As in other fields\\nconsidered earlier (Section VI), in this area\\ntoo, the need to combine procedural con-\\ncerns with those of actual events and out-\\ncomes is quite strong.\\nVIII. Values and Individual Choices\\nI have so far postponed discussing indi-\\nvidual behavior and rationality, though the\\nissue has indirectly figured in the preceding\\ndiscussions (for example, in dealing with\\nnorms for social choice, individual interest\\nin social welfare judgments, and determina-\\ntion of voting behavior). The public choice\\ntradition has tended to rely a good deal on\\nthe presumption that people behave in a\\nrather narrowly self-centered way-as homo\\neconomicus in particular, even though\\nBuchanan (1986 p. 26) himself notes some\\n\"tension\" on this issue (see also Geoffrey\\nBrennan and Loren Lomarsky, 1993). Public\\nservants inter alia are to be seen as working\\nfor their own well-being and success.\\nAdam Smith is sometimes described as\\nthe original proponent of the ubiquity and\\nethical adequacy of \"the economic man,\"\\nbut that would be fairly sloppy history. In\\nfact, Smith (1776, 1790) had examined the\\ndistinct disciplines of \"self-love,\" \"pru-\\ndence,\" \"sympathy,\" \"generosity,\" and\\n\"public spirit,\" among others, and had dis-\\ncussed not only their intrinsic importance,\\nbut also their instrumental roles in the suc-\\ncess of a society, and also their practical\\ninfluence on actual behavior. The demands\\nof rationality need not be geared entirely to\\nthe use of only one of these motivations\\n(such as self-love), and there is plenty of\\nempirical evidence to indicate that the pre-\\nsumption of uncompromising pursuit of nar-\\nrowly defined self-interest is as mistaken\\ntoday as it was in Smith\\'s time.43 Just as it is\\nnecessary to avoid the high-minded senti-\\nmentalism of assuming that all human be-\\nings (and public servants, in particular) try\\nconstantly to promote some selfless \"social\\ngood,\" it is also important to escape what\\nmay be called the \"low-minded sentimental-\\nism\" of assuming that everyone is constantly\\nmotivated entirely by personal self-\\ninterest.44\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'This does not, however, negate an impor-\\ntant implication of the question raised by\\nBuchanan and others that public servants\\nwould tend to have their own objective\\nfunctions; I would dissociate that point from\\nthe further claim, with which it has come\\nmixed, that these objective functions are\\nnarrowly confined to the officials\\' own self-\\ninterest. The important issue to emerge is\\nthat there is something missing in a large\\npart of the resource-allocation literature (for\\nexample, in proposals of algorithms for de-\\ncentralized resource allocation, from Oscar\\nLange and Abba Lerner onward) which\\nmake do without any independent objective\\nfunction of the agents of public action. The\\nadditional assumption of homo economicus\\nis not needed to point to this general\\nlacuna.\\nWhile this has been a somewhat ne-\\nglected question in social choice theory\\n(though partially dealt with in the related\\nliterature on implementation), there is no\\nparticular reason why such plurality of moti-\\nvations cannot be accommodated within a\\nsocial choice framework with more richly\\ndescribed social states and more articulated\\ncharacterization of individual choices and\\nbehavior. In the formulation of individual\\npreference used by Arrow (1951) and in\\ntraditional social choice theory, the nature\\nof the objective function of each individual\\nis left unspecified. While there is need for\\nsupplementary work here, this is a helpfully\\npermissive framework-not tied either to\\nceaseless do-gooding, or to uncompromising\\nself-centeredness.\\nEven with this extended framework, tak-\\ning us well beyond the homo economicus,\\nthere remain some difficulties with the no-\\ntion of individual rationality used here.\\nThere is a problem of \"insufficiency\" shared\\nby this approach to rationality with other\\n\"instrumental\" approaches to rationality,\\nsince it does not have any condition of criti-\\ncal scrutiny of the objectives themselves.\\nSocrates might have overstated matters a bit\\nwhen he proclaimed that \"the unexamined\\nlife is not worth living,\" but an examination\\nof what kind of life one should sensibly\\nchoose cannot really be completely irrele-\\nvant to rational choice.45 An \"instrumental\\nrationalist\" is a decision expert whose re-\\nsponse to seeing a man engaged in slicing\\nhis toes with a blunt knife is to rush to\\nadvise him that he should use a sharper\\nknife to better serve his evident objective.\\nThis is perhaps more of a limitation in\\nthe normative context than in using the\\npresumption of rationality as a device for\\npredicting behavior, since such critical\\nscrutiny might not be very widely practiced.\\nHowever, the last is not altogether clear,\\nsince discussions and exchange, and even\\npolitical arguments, contribute to the for-\\nmation and revision of values. As Frank\\nKnight (1947 p. 280) noted, \"Values are\\nestablished or validated and recognized\\nthrough discussion, an activity which is at\\nonce social, intellectual, and creative.\"\\nThere is, in fact, much force in Buchanan\\'s\\n(1954a p. 120) assertion that this is a central\\ncomponent of democracy (\"government by\\ndiscussion\") and that \"individual values can\\nand do change in the process of decision-\\nmaking.\"\\nThis issue has some real practical impor-\\ntance. To illustrate, in studying the fact that\\nfamines occur in some countries but not in\\nothers, I have tried to point to the phe-\\nnomenon that no major famine has ever\\ntaken place in any country with a multiparty\\ndemocracy with regular elections and with a\\nreasonably free press (Sen, 1984).46 This\\napplies as much to the poorer democratic\\ncountries (such as India, Zimbabwe, or\\nBotswana) as to the richer ones.47 This is\\nlargely because famines, while killing mil-\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'lions, do not much affect the direct well-\\nbeing of the ruling classes and dictators,\\nwho have little political incentive to prevent\\nfamines unless their rule is threatened by\\nthem. The economic analysis of famines\\nacross the world indicates that only a small\\nproportion of the population tends to be\\nstricken-rarely more than 5 percent or so.\\nSince the shares of income and food of\\nthese poor groups tend normally to be no\\nmore than 3 percent-of the total for the\\nnation, it is not hard to rebuild their lost\\nshare of income and food, even in very poor\\ncountries, if a serious effort is made in that\\ndirection (see Sen, 1981; Dreze and Sen,\\n1989). Famines are thus easily preventable,\\nand the need to face public criticism and to\\nencounter the electorate provides the gov-\\nernment with the political incentive to take\\npreventive action with some urgency.\\nThe question that remains is this. Since\\nonly a very small proportion of the popula-\\ntion is struck by a famine (typically 5 per-\\ncent or less), how does it become such a\\npotent force in elections and in public criti-\\ncism? This is in some tension with the as-\\nsumption of universal self-centeredness, and\\npresumably we do have the capacity-and\\noften the inclination-to understand and\\nrespond to the predicament of others.48\\nThere is a particular need in this context to\\nexamine value formation that results from\\npublic discussion of miserable events, in\\ngenerating sympathy and commitment on\\nthe part of citizens to do something to pre-\\nvent their occurrence.\\nEven the idea of \"basic needs,\" fruitfully\\nused in the development literature, has to\\nbe related to the fact that what is taken as a\\n\"need\" is not determined only by biological\\nand uninfluencible factors. For example, in\\nthose parts of the so-called Third World in\\nwhich there has been increased and exten-\\nsive public discussion of the consequences\\nof frequent childbearing on the well-being\\nand freedom of mothers, the perception that\\na smaller family is a \"basic need\" of women\\n(and men too) has grown, and in this value\\nformation a combination of democracy, free\\npublic media, and basic education (espe-\\ncially female education) has been very po-\\ntent.

       " 'nomicus (as in traditional public choice the-\\nory).\\nIX. Concluding Remarks\\nPerhaps I could end by briefly returning\\nto the questions with which I began. Arrow\\'s\\nimpossibility theorem does indeed identify a\\nprofound difficulty in combining individual\\npreference orderings into aggregative\\nsocial welfare judgments (Section II). But\\nthe result must not be seen as mainly a\\nnegative one, since it directly leads on to\\nquestions about how to overcome these\\nproblems. In the context of social welfare\\njudgments, the natural resolution of these\\nproblems lies in enriching the informational\\nbase, and there are several distinct ways of\\ndoing this (Section IV). These approaches\\nare used in practice for aggregative judg-\\nments made by individuals, but they can\\nalso be used for organized procedures for\\narriving at social measures of poverty, in-\\nequality, distribution-adjusted real national\\nincomes, and other such aggregative indica-\\ntors.\\nSecond, Buchanan\\'s questioning of the\\nconcept of social preference (and of its use\\nas an ordering to make-or explain-social\\nchoices) is indeed appropriate in the case of\\nsocial decision mechanisms, though less so\\nfor social welfare judgments (Section III).\\nThe Arrow theorem, in its original form,\\ndoes not apply once social decision-making\\nis characterized in terms of choice func-\\ntions without any imposed requirement of\\nintermenu consistency. However, when the\\nnatural implications of taking a .choice-\\nfunctional view of social decisions are\\nworked out, Arrow\\'s conditions have to be\\ncorrespondingly restated, and then the im-\\npossibility result returns in its entirety once\\nagain (Section III). The idea of social pref-\\nerence or internal consistency of social\\nchoice is basically redundant for this impos-\\nsibility result. So Buchanan\\'s move does not\\nnegate Arrow\\'s impossibility. On the other\\nhand, it is an important departure in its own\\nright.\\nComing to terms with the impossibility\\nproblem in the case of social decision mech-\\nanisms is largely a matter of give and take\\nbetween different principles with respective\\nappeals. This calls for a less rigid interpre-\\ntation of the role of axiomatic demands on\\npermissible social decision rules (Section V).\\nThird, Buchanan\\'s argument for a more\\nprocedural view of social decisions has much\\nmerit. Nevertheless, there are good reasons\\nto doubt the adequacy of a purely procedu-\\nral view (independent of consequences), just\\nas there are serious defects in narrowly con-\\nsequentialist views (independent of proce-\\ndures). Procedural concerns can, however,\\nbe amalgamated with consequential ones by\\nrecharacterizing states of affairs appropri-\\nately, and the evaluation of states can then\\ntake note of the two aspects together (Sec-\\ntion VI). This combination is especially im-\\nportant in accommodating liberty and rights\\nin social judgments as well as social decision\\nmechanisms (Section VII).\\nFinally, there is room for paying more\\nattention to the rationality of individual be-\\nhavior as an integral component of rational\\nsocial decisions. In particular, the practical\\nreach of social choice theory, in its tradi-\\ntional form, is considerably reduced by its\\ntendency to ignore value formation through\\nsocial interactions. Buchanan is right to em-\\nphasize the role of public discussion in the\\ndevelopment of preferences (as an impor-\\ntant part of democracy). However, tradi-\\ntional public choice theory is made unduly\\nnarrow by the insistence that individu-\\nals invariably behave as homo economicus\\n(a subject on which social choice theory\\nis much more permissive). This uncompro-\\nmising restriction can significantly misrep-\\nresent the nature of social concerns and\\nvalues. But aside from this descriptive limi-\\ntation, there is also an important issue of\\n\"practical reason\" here. Many of the more\\nexacting problems of the contemporary\\nworld-varying from famine prevention to\\nenvironmental preservation-actually call\\nfor value formation through public discus-\\nsion (Section VIII).\\nOn the rationality of social decisions,\\nmany important lessons have emerged from\\nthe discipline of social choice theory as well\\nas the public choice approach. In fact, we\\ncan get quite a bit more by combining these\\nlessons. As a social choice theorist, I had\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

As\\nArrow wrote, \"Recovery from disease is as\\nunpredictable as its incidence\" ( 1963 p. 951 ).\\nAt the same time that Arrow was depicting\\nthe theoretical landscape, Martin Feldstein\\nwas pioneering in the application of quantita-\\ntive methods such as 2-stage least squares,\\nprincipal component analysis, and linear pro-\\ngramming to the estimation of production\\nfunctions and other important economic as-\\npects of medical care. His numerous papers\\nanalyzing the British National Health Service\\nformed the basis for his Ph.D. thesis at Oxford\\nUniversity (Feldstein, 1967).\\nA third line of work that has had a signif-\\nicant influence on health economics also be-\\ngan in the early 1960\\'s with the National\\nBureau of Economic Research Conference\\non Investment in Human Beings (1962) and\\nGary S.

As early\\nas 1932, Michael M. Davis and C. Rufus\\nRorem (1932) were writing about the crisis in\\nhospital finance. Significant contributions to\\nthis genre have been made by Henry Aaron,\\nAlain Enthoven, Rashi Fein, Eli Ginzberg,\\nHerbert Klarman, Dorothy Rice, Anne Scitovsky,\\nAnne and Herman Somers, Burton Weisbrod,\\nand many others. Although they are all econ-\\nomists, much of their work does not appear in\\neconomics journals, but rather in books and in\\npublications such as the New England Journal\\nof Medicine, Journal of the American Medical\\nAssociation, Milbank Memorial Fund Quar-\\nterly, and Health Affairs.\\nIn recent decades several leading health\\neconomists have addressed theoretical, empir-\\nical, and policy questions in various aspects of\\ntheir research (e.g., Joseph Newhouse, Mark\\nPauly). Health economics has also been enliv-\\nened and enriched by contributions from econ-\\nomists who are primarily specialists in other\\nfields such as industrial organization, labor, fi-\\nnance, and public economics (e.g., Sherwin\\nRosen, Richard Zeckhauser). There has also\\nbeen a welcome infusion from another direc-\\ntion, namely physicians who have earned\\nPh.D.s in economics and who now contribute\\nto the economics literature (e.g., Alan Garber,\\nMark McClellan).\\nParenthetically, all this name-dropping has\\na point. I want to underscore the varied intellec-\\ntual, methodological, and ideological sources\\nthat have contributed to the health economics\\nenterprise. Research has often been described\\nas lonely work, and in one sense it is. But in\\nanother sense it is the most collective of all\\nhuman activities. The philosopher Susan Haack\\n(1995) sees scientific research as analogous to\\nan attempt by many participants to fill out a\\nhuge crossword puzzle. We have clues; we try\\nout possible answers; we check to see whether\\nthey fit together. Occasionally, an Arrow or a\\nBecker comes up with one of the really big\\nanswers that runs across the puzzle and makes\\nit easier to discover the smaller words that in-\\ntersect it. If several of the small answers don\\'t\\nfit, however, we may have to modify or even\\nreject the larger one. It is good to remember\\nthat all answers are provisional until the puzzle\\nis completed-and it never will be.5\\nAlthough I have mentioned only American\\neconomists, note should be taken of many fine\\nhealth economists in England, Canada, and\\nother high-income countries. There is, how-\\never, less of a global intellectual community\\nin this field than in some other branches of\\neconomics\\'-or in other fields of health7-\\nbecause most health economics research is\\napplied and is (or is perceived to be) coun-\\ntry specific. More than 60 years ago Walton\\nHamilton (1932) noted that \"The organiza-\\ntion of medicine is not a thing apart which can\\nbe subjected to study in isolation. It is an\\naspect of culture whose arrangements are\\ninseparable from the general organization of\\nsociety\" (p. 190). On the whole I agree\\nwith Hamilton; there are, however, important\\neconomic questions concerning technology\\nassessment and disease prevention that are\\ncommon to all high-income countries. This\\ntype of research does not receive support com-\\nmensurate with its importance because fund-\\ning sources, both public and private, tend to\\nfocus on national problems.\\nMy involvement in health economics grew\\nout of my research on the service industries\\n(Fuchs, 1968, 1969). It was motivated in part\\nby a desire to gain a better understanding of\\nthe postindustrial society that was emerging in\\nthe United States and other developed coun-\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The growth of the\\nservice economy and improved methods of\\ncontraception were bringing women into paid\\nemployment and dramatically changing gen-\\nder roles and relationships. Lower fertility and\\nlonger life expectancy were transforming the\\nage distribution of the population, and this\\ntransformation, along with the fragmentation\\nof the family and the declining influence of\\ntraditional religion, were creating new social\\nand economic conditions. The health sector,\\nwith its nonprofit institutions, professional\\ndominance, sharply skewed distribution of de-\\nmand, and the critical importance of the con-\\nsumer in the production process, seemed like\\na fruitful area for investigation. I was partic-\\nularly interested in trying to understand the de-\\nterminants of health and the determinants of\\nhealth care expenditures.\\nWith regard to health, my research has led\\nme to emphasize the importance of nonmedi-\\ncal factors such as genetic endowment, the\\nphysical and psychosocial environment, and\\npersonal behaviors such as cigarette smoking,\\ndiet, and exercise. Over time, advances in\\nmedical science contribute significantly to re-\\nductions in morbidity and mortality; at any\\ngiven point in time, however, differences in\\nhealth levels within or between developed\\ncountries are not primarily related to differ-\\nences in the quantity or quality of medical\\ncare.8\\nWith respect to expenditures on medical\\ncare, my research has led me to emphasize the\\nimportance of supply factors, especially tech-\\nnology and the number and specialty mix of\\nphysicians.9 To be sure, conventional demand\\nfactors such as price, income, and insurance\\nplay significant roles, but in my judgment con-\\ncentration on them to the exclusion of (partly\\nexogenous) supply factors misses a big part of\\nthe expenditures story. Despite many attempts\\nto discredit it,\\'? the hypothesis that fee-for-\\nservice physicians can and do induce demand\\nfor their services is alive and well.11\\nMy views about health and health care ex-\\npenditures have been formed not only through\\nresearch but also through close interaction\\nwith medical scientists, practicing physicians,\\nand other health professionals. Since 1968 I\\nhave maintained a regular medical school fac-\\nulty appointment in addition to my appoint-\\nment in economics, and have participated\\nevery year in a wide variety of health-related\\nactivities. This dual life would have gained ap-\\nproval from John Stuart Mill who, in The Prin-\\nciples of Political Economy (1848, reprinted\\n1987), wrote, \"It is hardly possible to overrate\\nthe value ... of placing human beings in contact\\nwith persons dissimilar to themselves, and\\nwith modes of thought and action unlike those\\nwith which they are familiar ... Such commu-\\nnication has always been ... one of the primary\\nsources of progress\" (p. 581).\\nThe proposition that the discipline of eco-\\nnomics has a great deal to contribute to health\\nand medical care is not one likely to require\\nelaborate defense before this audience. (I have\\nhad audiences that were less receptive to this\\nnotion.) It might, however, be useful to report\\nbriefly just what it was in economics that I\\nfound to be most relevant in the invasion of\\nalien turf. (To avoid undue suspense, let me\\nsay at once that it was not game theory.)\\nIn my experience, the most important con-\\ntribution we make is the economic point of\\nview, which may be summed up in three\\nwords: scarcity, substitutability, and hetero-\\ngeneity. This economic point of view stands\\nin stark contrast to the romantic and mono-\\ntechnic points of view that I found prevalent\\namong health professionals and health policy-\\nmakers. The romantic point of view refuses to\\naccept the notion that resources are inherently\\nscarce; any apparent scarcity is attributed to\\nsome manmade problem, such as capitalism or\\nsocialism, market failure or excessive govern-\\nment interference.

I suspect\\nthat there is a synergistic relationship in which\\nthe former provides the language to give\\nexpression to the latter. Or, as Max Weber\\n(1915; reprinted 1946) wrote, material and\\nideal interests are the tracks on which society\\nrides, but ideas throw the switches (p. 280).\\nThe monotechnic point of view, found fre-\\nquently among physicians, engineers, and oth-\\ners trained in the application of a particular\\ntechnology fails to recognize the diversity of\\nhuman wants, or acknowledge the difference\\nbetween what is technically best and what is\\nsocially desirable.\" \"Optimal\" care is defined\\nas the point where the marginal benefit is zero,\\nignoring the fact that resources used for health\\ncare have alternative uses that might yield\\ngreater benefit. The \"production\" of health is\\nviewed narrowly as a function of inputs of\\nmedical care, and the appropriate input mix\\nis assumed to be determined by technology\\nwithout regard to relative prices, explicit or\\nimplicit. For example, Feldstein found that av-\\nerage lengths of stay in British hospitals were\\nuniform across regions despite large regional\\ndifferences in the pressures for admission.\\'4\\nThe monotechnic view often fails to con-\\nsider the heterogeneity of preferences, even\\nthough for many health problems there are al-\\nternative interventions: one drug versus an-\\nother, drugs versus surgery, or even \"watchful\\nwaiting\" versus any intervention. Under the\\ninfluence of economists and other behavioral\\nscientists, physicians are now making such\\nchoices with more attention to patient differ-\\nences in time preference, attitudes toward risk,\\ntolerance of pain, functional needs, and other\\ncharacteristics.\\nAmong our specific tools, one of the most\\nuseful is the idea of the margin. The key to\\ngaining acceptance for this principle is to have\\npeople realize that most decisions involve a\\nlittle more or a little less, and that they will\\nmake better decisions if they look at the costs\\nand benefits associated with having a little\\nmore or a little less. This formulation is more\\neffective than postulating \"maximization,\"\\nwhich economists find useful for classroom or\\nresearch purposes, but sounds unreal to most\\nnoneconomists.\\nDavid M.

This screening test for cer-\\nvical cancer is of proven safety and effective-\\nness, and before Eddy\\'s work appeared most\\nexperts recommended that women obtain this\\ntest annually. Using mathematical models and\\nclinical studies of the natural history of the dis-\\nease, Eddy (a physician with extensive train-\\ning in operations research and economics)\\ncalculated the incremental cost of 1 additional\\nyear of life expectancy with screening regimes\\nranging from once every 6 months to once\\nevery 5 years. The results were striking. Some\\nscreening has a high yield at low incremental\\ncost, but as the frequency of screening is in-\\ncreased from once every 2 years to once a year\\nthe incremental cost rises to close to $1 million\\nper additional year of life expectancy (Eddy,\\n1980, 1987, 1990).15\\nThe impact of Eddy\\'s research on health\\npolicy is worth noting.

There was undoubtedly a\\nshift in the function associated with the intro-\\nduction of antibiotics and other advances in\\nmedical science (Fuchs, 1974b). In 1991 the\\nelasticity was -0.73 (0.12) but the change from\\n1965 to 1991 was consistent with an elasticity\\nof -1.08, suggesting a further shift in the func-\\ntion, but not nearly so large as the shift between\\n1937 and 1965.\\nEconomists have much to contribute to the\\nhealth field. What can they expect in exchange?\\nThe most immediate benefit to me was the pres-\\nsure to make my lectures and research results\\naccessible, relevant, and credible to intelligent\\nbut untutored and often unsympathetic audi-\\nences. I was obliged to write clearly and simply\\nand to reconsider assumptions and conclusions\\nin economics that I might otherwise have ac-\\ncepted too readily. My experience was in accord\\nwith that of Thomas Henry Huxley (1863) who\\nwrote, \"Some experience with popular lecturing\\nhas convinced me that the necessity of making\\nthings plain to uninstructed people was one of\\nthe very best means of clearing up the obscure\\ncorners in one\\'s own mind.\"\\nFor example, one of the questions that trou-\\nbled me for a long time is why there is such\\na strong correlation between health and years\\nof schooling. I originally believed that this\\nwas another manifestation of the productivity-\\nenhancing effect of education. Schooling could\\nincrease an individual\\'s knowledge about the\\nhealth effects of personal behavior and medical\\ncare options or could enable a person to better\\nprocess and act upon information about health\\n(Grossman, 1975). Or schooling could in-\\ncrease an individual\\'s ability to develop strat-\\negies of self control (Richard A. Thaler and\\nH. M. Shefrin, 1981). I began to doubt the\\nschooling-causes-health hypothesis, however,\\nwhen it was observed that the favorable effect\\nof an additional year of schooling on health\\ndoes not diminish with increased years of\\nschooling. It is just as strong for those with\\nmore than a high school education as for those\\nwith less and continues right through graduate\\nschool on up to the doctoral level (Grossman,\\n1975).19 I began to suspect that perhaps the cor-\\nrelation was the result of some underlying dif-\\nference among individuals that affects both\\nschooling and health.\\nTo explore this question I examined sur-\\nvey data on smoking behavior collected\\nby colleagues in the Stanford Heart Dis-\\nease Prevention Program as part of a health\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The most striking result was\\nthe absence of any increase in the size of the\\nschooling coefficient between the ages of 17\\nand 24. The additional schooling could not\\nbe the cause of the differential smoking be-\\nhavior (and by extension the differential\\nhealth associated with smoking) at age 24\\nbecause the differences in smoking were al-\\nready evident at age 17, before the dif-\\nferences in schooling had emerged (Philip\\nFarrell and Fuchs, 1982) .20\\nIn my judgment, the most likely explanation\\nfor the high correlation between health and\\nschooling is that both reflect differences in\\ntime preference (Fuchs, 1982). Both health\\nand schooling are aspects of investment in hu-\\nman capital; differences among individuals in\\ntime preference that are established at an early\\nage could result in different amounts of in-\\nvestment in health and education.21\\nAlthough I believe there have been many\\nfruitful interactions between economics and\\nhealth, the political debate over health care\\nreform in 1993-1994 benefited much less\\nthan it could have from the insights of econ-\\nomists. Possible explanations for the failure\\nof health economics research to have more\\nimpact on policy are explored in the next\\nsection.\\nII. The Present\\nGeorge Stigler\\'s Presidential Address to the\\nAmerican Economic Association in December\\n1964 was distinctive in its emphasis on proph-\\necy over preaching. To be specific, Stigler pre-\\ndicted that economics was \"at the threshold of\\nits golden age\" (Stigler, 1965 p. 17) because\\n\"the age of quantification is now full upon us\"\\n(p. 16). The growth of empirical estimation\\nwas, for Stigler, \"a scientific revolution of the\\nvery first magnitude\" (p. 17). He believed\\nthat empirical research would have an impact\\non policy far beyond anything possible from\\ntheory alone because \"a theory can usually be\\nmade to support diverse policy positions. The-\\nories present general relationships, and which\\npart of a theory is decisive in a particular con-\\ntext is a matter of empirical evidence\" (p. 13).\\nWith regard to health care, Stigler\\'s predic-\\ntion of a vast expansion in empirical research\\nhas been amply fulfilled. During the past 30\\nyears economists have published thousands of\\nempirical articles on various aspects of health\\nand medical care. But the shallow and incon-\\nclusive debate over health policy in 1993-\\n1994 contradicts his expectation that this\\nresearch would narrow the range of partisan\\ndisputes and make a significant contribution to\\nthe reconciliation of policy differences.22 What\\nwent wrong?\\nOne possibility is that the research was in-\\nconclusive. If health economists cannot agree\\namong themselves, why should their research\\nhave a salutary effect on public policy? Sec-\\nond, even if the research were conclusive, it\\nwould not be of much help to policy if the\\nresults were not adequately disseminated to a\\nwider audience. A third possible explanation\\nis that the policy debate foundered on differ-\\nences in values, differences which could not\\nbe reconciled by empirical research, however\\nconclusive and however well disseminated.\\nTo gain some insight into these matters,\\nI prepared a 20-question survey concerning\\nhealth economics and health policy and sent it\\nto health economists, economic theorists, and\\npracticing physicians.

The practicing physicians\\nwere reached through my personal contacts,\\nand include colleagues and friends of those\\ncontacts.

They\\ninclude generalists, surgical specialists, and\\nnonsurgical specialists. There were 42 physi-\\ncian respondents (response rate 89 percent).\\nThe participants were asked to indicate\\nwhether they agree or disagree with each of 20\\nrelatively short statements; they were also\\ngiven the option of answering \"no opinion.\"\\nTen percent of the health economists\\' replies\\nwere \"no opinion\"; the theorists used that op-\\ntion 19 percent of the time, and the physicians\\n11 percent. Participants were also invited to\\nqualify any of their replies by jotting com-\\nments on the back of the survey. The percent-\\nage of replies that were qualified was 8, 5, and\\n3 for the health economists, theorists, and phy-\\nsicians, respectively. Participants were told to\\nassume that the statements refer to the United\\nStates in 1995, other things held constant. For\\nstatements with more than one part, \"agree\"\\nwould indicate that the respondent agreed with\\nall parts of the statement. The order of the\\nquestions was determined randomly, and re-\\nspondents were guaranteed anonymity.\\nThree experts24 from three different univer-\\nsities who were not participants in the survey\\nwere asked to identify which of the 20 ques-\\ntions were relatively value-free (\"positive\"\\nquestions) and which had substantial value as-\\npects (\"policy-value\" questions). Their in-\\ndependent replies were almost unanimous in\\nidentifying seven of the questions as \"posi-\\ntive,\" and thirteen as \"policy-value.\" Table 1\\nshows the percent agreeing for each question,\\nwith the two types of questions grouped sep-\\narately. Question numbers refer to the ordering\\nof the questions in the survey. The policy-\\nvalue questions are presented in three groups:\\nfour that pertain directly to national health in-\\nsurance, three that pertain directly to health\\ninsurance company underwriting, and all oth-\\ners. Questions for which the percentage agree-\\ning differs significantly from a 50-50 split (by\\na chi-square test) are identified with asterisks.\\nWe see in Table 1 that the degree of con-\\nsensus on positive questions among health\\neconomists is extremely high.25 In six of the\\nseven cases the hypothesis that the observed\\nsplit differs from a 50-50 split simply by\\nchance is rejected with p < 0.01 and the sev-\\nenth with p < 0.05. There is also a high degree\\nof consensus among economic theorists, but\\nfor two of the questions (12 and 13) the ma-\\njority of theorists gave replies opposite to\\nthe majority of health economists. Consensus\\namong the physicians on the positive questions\\nwas more rare. In no case did the split differ\\nfrom 50-50 with p < 0.01, and in only three\\ncases was the split significant at p < 0.05. For\\none question (4) the majority of physicians\\ngave replies opposite to the majority of health\\neconomists.26\\nWhen we turn to the policy-value questions,\\nagreement among the health economists drops\\nsharply.

       " \"Why is there so little agreement among econ-\\nomists regarding policy-value questions when\\nthere is so much agreement on the positive\\nquestions? One possible explanation is differ-\\nences in values. Most health policy decisions\\nhave significant implications for freedom, effi-\\nciency, justice, and security. Health economists\\n(like other Americans) probably desire all these\\ngoals, but (again like other Americans) they\\nprobably differ in the values they attach to\\nthem, or in the way they define them,3' and\\nthese differences could lead to sharply different\\nviews about policy.\\nAnother possible explanation is that there\\nare positive questions embedded in the policy-\\nvalue questions and that health economists dis-\\nagree with respect to those positive questions.\\nThis is the view taken by Milton Friedman in\\n195332 although he subsequently modified his\\nposition in 1966 and 1995.33 In order to gain\\nsome insights concerning the roles of values\\nand embedded positive issues in policy differ-\\nences I take a closer look at the policy-value\\nquestions bearing on national health insurance\\n(3, 7, 14, 15) and on insurance company un-\\nderwriting (8, 17, 20).\\nConsider, for instance, question 3 which\\ncalls for some national plan to cover the entire\\npopulation. The 62-38 percent split among\\nhealth economists may well reflect differences\\nin values, with those who agree placing a high\\nvalue on providing all Americans with the\\nright to have access to health care. On the other\\nhand, it is readily apparent that there are many\\npositive questions embedded in this policy-\\nvalue question. For instance, most economists\\nsee a loss in efficiency from requiring every-\\none to have the same health insurance, but they\\nprobably differ in their estimates of the extent\\nof the loss. Some may even believe there is a\\nnet gain in efficiency because of imperfections\\nin the private market for health insurance.\\nStrongly held differences about this positive\\nquestion could produce different answers to\\nquestion 3 even among respondents with sim-\\nilar values.\\nSome of the positive questions embedded in\\nquestion 3 may be beyond the scope of con-\\nventional economics. For instance, Professor\\nA may favor national health insurance in part\\nbecause she believes it will contribute to a\\nmore stable and harmonious society.34 Profes-\\nsor B may disagree with that prediction, and\\nis therefore less inclined to support national\\nhealth insurance.\\nThe role of embedded positive questions\\ncan also be easily discerned in the three ques-\\ntions (8, 17, 20) dealing with insurance com-\\npany underwriting. Health economists strongly\\nsupport charging higher premiums for smokers\\nthan for nonsmokers, but are strongly opposed\\nto charging higher premiums to individuals\\nborn with genetic defects. On question 8, deal-\\ning with requiring insurance companies to in-\\nsure the sick with no premium surcharge, the\\nhealth economists are evenly split. One of the\\npositive questions embedded in question 8 is\\nthe reason for people's illness. If a respondent\\nthought that most illness was the result of ge-\\nnetic differences, the reply would presumably\\nbe consistent with the answer to question 20.\\nOn the other hand, if most illness was assumed\\nto be the result of personal behaviors like cig-\\narette smoking, the reply would probably be\\nconsistent with the one given to question 17.\\nInasmuch as leading medical scientists have\\nstrongly divergent views about the importance\\nof genetic factors in disease, it is hardly\\nsurprising that health economists are unable\\nto reach agreement.

Thus, if cigarette smok-\\ning were found to be determined primarily by\\ngenetic factors, the answers to question 17\\nwould probably change even in the absence of\\nany change in values.\\nPositive economic questions are also em-\\nbedded in the insurance company underwriting\\nissues. Most economists realize that requiring\\nhealth insurance companies to charge healthy\\npeople the same premium as those with a ge-\\nnetic disease will deter healthy individuals\\nfrom purchasing insurance. But economists\\nmay well differ as to how large that effect will\\nbe and how large a welfare loss it implies.\\nIt is easy to see that there are positive ques-\\ntions embedded in the policy-value questions,\\nbut it is more difficult to believe that disagree-\\nment over them, rather than differences in\\nvalues, explains the low level of consensus\\namong health economists with respect to the\\npolicy-value questions. Note that the physi-\\ncians have a higher level of consensus about\\nthe policy-value questions than do the health\\neconomists. This probably reflects more ho-\\nmogeneous values among physicians rather\\nthan agreement about the embedded positive\\nquestions. (Note the low level of agreement\\namong physicians on the explicit positive\\nquestions.)\\nIt may be that it is not so much disagreement\\namong health economists about the embedded\\npositive questions as it is uncertainty about\\nthem that make differences in values the\\ndriving force in replies to the policy-value\\nquestions. Many psychologists and economists\\nhave observed that uncertainty about a datum\\ncauses most individuals to give it less weight\\nwhen making choices.:\\nUncertainty among health economists con-\\ncerning the positive questions that are embed-\\nded in the policy-value questions is suggested\\nby their use of the \"no opinion\" option. Un-\\nlike the theorists, who chose \"no opinion\"\\ntwice as often for the positive questions as for\\nthe policy-value questions (28 percent versus\\n15 percent), the health economists chose \"no\\nopinion\" less often for the positive questions\\nthan for the policy-value questions (8 percent\\nversus 11 percent).36 The role of uncertainty\\nwas mentioned by Milton Friedman in 1966 as\\na reason for qualifying his position about the\\nrelative imeportance of scientific judgment and\\nvalue differences (Friedman, 1966 p. 6).\\nIn order to investigate further the relation-\\nship between policy-value and positive ques-\\ntions, I developed two indexes based on the\\nanswers to the national health insurance and\\ninsurance underwriting questions. The first in-\\ndex measures each respondent\\'s support for\\nnational health insurance. It is constructed by\\nassigning a value of 1 to agreement with each\\nof questions 3, 7, 14, and 15, a value of 0 for\\ndisagreement with those questions, and a value\\nof 0.5 for no opinion. The sum of the values\\nwas divided by 4, giving a range for the index\\nof 1 (indicating agreement with all four ques-\\ntions) to 0 (indicating disagreement with all\\nfour questions). The \"actuarial\" 37 model in-\\ndex was based on answers to questions 8, 17,\\nand 20. In the case of question 8, \"disagree\"\\nwas given a value of 1, and for questions 17\\nand 20 \"agree\" was given a value of 1. The\\ntotal score for each individual is divided by 3,\\nagain yielding a range for the index from 1 to\\n0 (indicating complete support or complete re-\\njection of the actuarial approach).\\nThe results are presented in Table 3. We\\nsee that with respect to national health insurance\\nthe support among the three groups is virtually\\nidentical. There is considerable variation around\\nthe mean for each group, and the amount of vari-\\nation is similar across thOe groups. Thirteen per-\\ncent of all respondents had an index value of 1,\\nwhile 15 percent completely rejected the notion\\nof national health insurance with an index value\\nof 0. Not surprisingly, there is a negative cor-\\nrelation between the national health insurance\\nindex and the actuarial model index. But there\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Overall, one must conclude that they\\nhave not been very successful, as revealed by\\nthe political debate of 1993- 1994 and the me-\\ndia coverage of policy issues. Consider, for\\nexample, question 19 concerning whether in\\nthe long run employers bear the primary bur-\\nden of their contributions to their employees'\\nhealth insurance. Although 87 percent of the\\nhealth economists disagreed with that state-\\nment, politicians on both sides of the debate\\nassumed, erroneously, that it was correct.\\nMoreover, nearly all of the media made the\\nsame error. Most of the politicians and most\\nof the media also showed little understanding\\nof questions 4, 12, 13, and 18.\\nI am as ready as the next economist to\\ncriticize politicians and journalists, but the\\nsurvey results suggest that their poor under-\\nstanding of health economics is not entirely\\ntheir fault. First, the economic theorists\\nand the practicing physicians, two groups with\\nabove-average ability and opportunity to ab-\\nsorb the conclusions of the health economists,\\ndid not show good command of the positive\\nquestions. In my judgment the health econo-\\nmists answered 80 percent correctly, but the\\naverage theorist answered only 52 percent cor-\\nrectly and the mean score for the physicians\\nwas only 53 percent. The differences in the\\ndistributions of scores is striking: 45 of the\\n46 health economists had more correct an-\\nswers than the average theorist or the average\\nphysician.\\nA second possible reason for the poor un-\\nderstanding of health economics displayed by\\nthe politicians and the media in 1993-1994 is\\nthe wide disagreement among health econo-\\nmists over the policy-value questions. When\\nhealth economists interact with politicians and\\njournalists, their discussions probably focus on\\nthe policy-value questions; in the absence of a\\nprofessional consensus on many of these ques-\\ntions, it is not surprising that politicians and\\njournalists fall back on their own values to\\nshape their positions.\\nReturning to the question posed at the be-\\nginning of this section about why economic\\nresearch failed to result in a more informed\\nand productive health care policy debate, the\\nsurvey results provide some provisional an-\\nswers. First, although health economists are\\nin substantial agreement about the positive\\nquestions, they have major disagreements\\nabout policy-value questions. Second, health\\neconomists were not successful in getting\\ntheir conclusions on positive questions ac-\\ncepted by the politicians or the media, and\\neven had difficulty in communicating their\\nresults to economic theorists and practicing\\nphysicians. Third, the health economists'\\ndisagreements over policy probably reflect\\ndifferences in values, although it is clear that\\nthere are many positive questions embedded\\nin the policy-value questions. In my judg-\\nment the problem is not so much that the\\nhealth economists disagree about the embed-\\nded questions as that they are uncertain\\nabout them. In the face of such uncertainty,\\nthey tend to let their values drive their policy\\nrecommendations.\\nIII. The Future\\nIf values play such an important role in pol-\\nicy disputes, what are the implications for\\neconomics and economists? First, we should\\nendeavor to make explicit the differences in\\nvalues, and seek ways to resolve them. Value\\ndifferences can take many different forms.\\nEconomists are most familiar with the distinc-\\ntion between efficiency and distributional is-\\nsues, especially greater equality of income\\nversus greater total income.40 But comprehen-\\nsive changes in health policy can have other\\nimportant distributional effects.

This would\\npoint the way to productive research. If the\\nembedded questions are identified and studied,\\nit should be possible to reduce the uncertainty\\nabout them and thus provide a basis for nar-\\nrowing differences on policy-value questions.\\nA third agenda item for economists is to un-\\ndertake research on the formation of values,\\nespecially insofar as they are the consequences\\nof policy. Economists are understandably re-\\nluctant to prescribe values or to make nor-\\nmative judgments about them. But when\\neconomic policies affect values and prefer-\\nences, and these in turn affect behavior, it is\\nincumbent on economists to analyze the links\\nbetween policies and values, and to examine\\nthe economic and social consequences of al-\\nternative value systems. I believe there is an\\nanalogy between the economics of values and\\nthe economics of technology. Over the past\\nseveral decades some economists have begun\\nto treat technology as at least partly endoge-\\nnous.4\" Now, a similar effort must be un-\\ndertaken for values (Henry J. Aaron, 1994;\\nBecker, 1996; Albert 0. Hirschman, 1986;\\nAssar Lindbeck, 1994).\\nFinally, economists must develop more self-\\nawareness of how our values color our judg-\\nment about policy, and more candor in making\\nclear to others the respective roles of positive\\nresearch and of values in our policy recom-\\nmendations. Alice M. Rivlin, in her AEA pres-\\nidential address in December 1986, warned\\neconomists against letting \"their ideological\\nposition cloud their judgment about the likely\\neffects of particular policies\" (p. 4). She\\nurged us \"... to be more careful to sort out, for\\nourselves and others, what we really know\\nfrom our ideological biases\" (p. 9). In my\\nview, there is a vast difference between a re-\\nsearcher and a reformer, between an analyst\\nand a player in the policy arena. They are all\\nsocially valuable occupations, and the same\\nindividual may successfully wear different\\nhats at different times. What is not likely to\\nwork well, either for economics or for policy,\\nis trying to wear two hats at the same time.\\nIn the remainder of this paper I present a\\nsummary of my policy recommendations for\\nhealth system reform. The use of the bully pul-\\npit by an AEA president to push personal pol-\\nicy choices has ample precedent, but I also\\nwant to use this opportunity to show how those\\nchoices are shaped by the interaction between\\nmy values and my understanding of health\\neconomics. Finally, I identify aspects of my\\npolicy recommendations that are problematic\\nand which would clearly benefit from addi-\\ntional research.\\nMy three major recommendations are:\\n(i) a broad-based tax earmarked for health\\ncare to provide every American with a\\nvoucher for participation in a basic plan;\\n(ii) provision of care through integrated health\\nsystems that include hospitals, physician\\nservices, and prescription drugs. These\\nsystems would be led by physicians, would\\nbe reimbursed by capitation plus modest\\nco-payment from patients at the time of\\nuse, and would be required to offer a wide\\nvariety of point-of-service options to be\\npaid for by patients with after-tax dollars;\\n(iii) a large private center for technology as-\\nsessment financed by a small industry-\\nwide levy on all health care spending.\\nMy desire to see all Americans insured for\\na basic health plan is clearly driven in part by\\nvalues. Although medical care is often not a\\ncrucial factor in health outcomes, it is nearly\\nalways a source of utility through its caring\\nand validation functions. In my judgment, it\\nfully meets Adam Smith\\'s 1776 definition of\\na necessary: \"By necessaries I understand not\\nonly the commodities which are indispensably\\nnecessary for the support of life but whatever\\nthe custom of the country renders it indecent\\nfor creditable people, even of the lowest order,\\nto be without\" (1776; republished 1937 p.\\n821).

I prefer the former\\nbecause the latter are extremely expensive to\\nadminister and seriously distort incentives;\\nthey result in the near-poor facing marginal tax\\nrates that would be regarded as confiscatory if\\nlevied on the affluent.43\\nBoth theory and experience show that inte-\\ngrated health care systems are usually the best\\nway to deliver cost-effective care. The primary\\nreason is the physician\\'s central role in medi-\\ncal decision-making. Under any approach to\\ncare, it is the physician who admits patients to\\nhospitals, orders tests and other procedures,\\nand decides when to discharge. It is the phy-\\nsician who prescribes drugs and who refers\\npatients to other physicians for consultation\\nand treatment. Thus physicians\\' decisions\\nare the major determinant of the cost of care.\\nOnly in an integrated system, however, do\\nphysicians have the incentive, the informa-\\ntion, and the infrastructure needed to make\\nthese decisions in a cost-effective way. In-\\ntegrated systems also have an advantage in\\navoiding excess capacity of high-cost equip-\\nment and personnel.\\nGiven the central importance of physicians\\nto medical care, I believe the integrated sys-\\ntems should be led by them and other health\\ncare professionals. At a minimum, health care\\nprofessionals should have a prominent place\\nin the govermance of the systems. One of the\\ngreatest errors of health policy-makers today\\nis their assumption that market competition or\\ngovernment regulation are the only instru-\\nments available to control health care. There\\nis room for, indeed need for, a revitalization\\nof professional norms as a third instrument of\\ncontrol.\\' The patient-physician relationship\\noften is highly personal and intimate, similar\\nin many ways to relationships within families\\nor between teachers and pupils or ministers\\nand congregants. This relationship is, in part,\\nwhat economist Kenneth Boulding (1968)\\ncalled an integrative system, one that depends\\non mutual recognition and acceptance of rights\\nand responsibilities, enforced by traditional\\nnorms as well as market pressures and govern-\\nment regulations. As long as physicians con-\\ntrol the use of complex technology in life and\\ndeath situations, and as long as we expect them\\nto perform priestly functions, they must be en-\\ndowed with certain privileges and held to cer-\\ntain standards of behavior different from those\\nassumed by models of market competition or\\ngovernment regulation.45\\nComprehensive government control of medi-\\ncal care has not worked well in any setting.\\nThe essence of good care is an informed pa-\\ntient working cooperatively with a health pro-\\nfessional who provides personalized attention\\nand concern. The rules, regulations, and bu-\\nreaucratic controls that almost always accom-\\npany governmental activities are inimical to\\nhigh-quality cost-effective care. It is revealing\\nthat countries such as England and Sweden\\nwith deep government involvement in the\\nfinancing of medical care have bent over back-\\nwards to leave physicians with a great deal of\\nprofessional autonomy-indeed more auton-\\nomy than is possessed by many American phy-\\nsicians working in a \"private\" system.\\nMarket competition also has its problems.

In addition, pa-\\ntients should be required to make modest co-\\npayments at the time of use (e.g., $15 for each\\nvisit and $5 for each prescription).

If, during the\\npast 30 years, health care spending had grown\\nat the rate of the rest of the economy, the\\nhealth care bill in 1995 would have been only\\na little more than $400 billion. What accounts\\nfor this extraordinary excess of almost $600\\nbillion in annual spending? There has been a\\nsmall increase in physician visits per capita,\\nbut use of acute care hospitals has decreased\\nsharply. Patient-days per 1000 population are\\nless than three fifths the level of 30 years ago.\\nBy far the most important factor accounting\\nfor the increase in health care's share of the\\nGDP is the change in technology.50 Physician\\nvisits and hospital-days cost more than they\\nused to because the content has changed-the\\ntechnologies used for diagnosis and treatment\\nare more expensive than in the past. Much of\\nthis technological change is welcome; it con-\\ntributes to enhancing the length and quality of\\nlife. Some of the change is less desirable be-\\ncause it adds more to cost than to patient ben-\\nefit. Unfortunately, there is great uncertainty\\nregarding the merits of many technologies.\\nMoreover, even when the advantages and dis-\\nadvantages are known, there are often signif-\\nicant barriers facing physicians who would\\nlike to practice in a cost-effective manner.\\nTo deal with this problem, I propose the cre-\\nation of a large, private center for technology\\nassessment. Financing for this center would\\ncome from a small levy (less than one tenth of\\n1 percent) on all health care spending. A cen-\\ntralized approach is necessary, because health\\ncare is highly fragmented. Individual physi-\\ncians and health plans lack the incentive and\\nability to commit the resources needed to as-\\nsess -new technologies. Even the largest insur-\\nance companies individually account for only\\na small percentage of the health care market;\\nthey are, therefore, understandably reluctant to\\npay for large-scale assessments that would\\nbenefit all.51 Government agencies try to fill\\nthe void, but the scale of effort is too small,\\nand a private center would be able to avoid the\\npolitical interference that often intrudes on\\ngovernment-run agencies.52 Health care pro-\\nviders would fund and set the agenda for the\\ncenter, much as the electric power companies\\ndo for the Electric Power Research Institute.\\nThis institute is financed by a small levy on\\nevery public utility bill.\\nA health care technology assessment center\\nwould have two primary functions.

The center would\\nhave some intramural research capability, but\\nmost of the research would be conducted extra-\\nmurally at medical schools, hospitals, and re-\\nsearch institutes throughout the country. It would\\nprovide health professionals with essential in-\\nformation to evaluate and improve their clinical\\npractices and offer a rational basis for deciding\\nwhat services should be included in the basic\\nplan.\\nThe second important function would be to\\nprovide legitimacy for the cost-effective prac-\\ntice of medicine. Currently, many directors of\\nhealth plans and many individual physicians\\nknow they could be practicing in a more cost-\\neffective way, but they are inhibited from do-\\ning so because they do not practice in a\\nvacuum. Physicians are influenced by peers\\nwho have been trained in settings that empha-\\nsized the use of the latest technologies regard-\\nless of cost. Patients come with particular sets\\nof expectations based on what they read or\\nhear in the media and what their relatives and\\nfriends tell them has been their experience.\\nThe threat of malpractice suits lurks in the\\nbackground.

The link\\nbetween the earmarked tax and the basic plan\\nwould create a healthy tension between the de-\\nsire to increase benefits and the need to pay\\nfor the increase in a responsible and equitable\\nmanner. Competition among health care sys-\\ntems in highly populated areas would widen\\nchoice and foster cost-effective practice. The\\nprivate technology assessment center would\\nhelp to contain costs without the imposition of\\ncontrols or caps that might stifle innovation\\nand progress.\\nAre these recommendations politically sale-\\nable? In the short run, certainly not. But nei-\\nther are any other proposals for comprehensive\\nreform. Indeed, for more than 20 years it has\\nbeen my view that the United States would not\\nenact comprehensive health care reform ex-\\ncept in the wake of a major war, a depression,\\nlarge-scale civil unrest, or some other event\\nthat completely changed the political cli-\\nmate. Why is the United States the only major\\nindustrialized nation without national health\\ninsurance? Many observers focus on the op-\\nposition of \"special interests,\" and that cer-\\ntainly is a factor, but I do not find it a\\ncompletely satisfactory explanation. After all,\\nspecial interests are not unknown in Sweden,\\nEngland, Canada, and other countries that do\\nhave national health insurance.\\nIn 1976 I suggested four reasons for its ab-\\nsence in the United States: distrust of govern-\\nment, heterogeneity of the population, a weak\\nsense of noblesse oblige, and strong private\\nvoluntary organizations such as nonprofit hos-\\npitals and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans\\nthat carry out quasi-governmental functions\\nwith respect to the financing and delivery of\\nhealth care (Fuchs, 1976). Upon revisiting\\nthis question (Fuchs, 1991), I concluded that\\nthe first three reasons were stronger than ever,\\nbut the fourth had weakened considerably. It\\nis ironic that \"the competition revolution\"\\n(Fuchs, 1988b), which erodes the ability of\\nnot-for-profit health care institutions to pro-\\nvide a modicum of social insurance through\\ncommunity rating and cost shifting, may in the\\nlong run push the country toward national\\nhealth insurance.\\nMy plan is certainly not a panacea; it would\\nbe difficult to implement and others might\\nseek a different balance of values. Several as-\\npects require additional research. For example,\\nwhat should be the content of the basic plans?\\nHow should the content change over time?\\nHow should the plans be reimbursed from the\\nfunds raised by the earmarked tax, and espe-\\ncially how should reimbursement be risk ad-\\njusted to take account of differences in plan\\npopulations? Another problem is how to en-\\ncourage competition among plans where it is\\nfeasible, while recognizing that a competitive\\napproach will not be desirable or possible in\\nareas of low population density. Considerable\\nresearch is needed on how the out-of-plan op-\\ntions should be priced53 and how the providers\\nof such care should be reimbursed. Finally,\\nmuch thought should be given to how to re-\\ninvigorate professional norms as a third in-\\nstrument of control, along with market com-\\npetition and government regulation.54\\nI conclude this tour of health economics-\\npast, present, and future-on a mildly opti-\\nmistic note. In the past three decades econom-\\nics has made a positive contribution to health\\nand medical care, and I believe that future con-\\ntributions will be even greater.

First, it is very difficult to disentangle\\nviews of the proper role for trade policy in\\ndevelopment from views about the appropriate\\nrole for the state. Partly as a legacy of the\\nGreat Depression, partly because of the belief\\nthat the Soviet Union had succeeded in its de-\\nvelopmental and industrial aspirations through\\ncentral planning, and partly because of the per-\\nceived success of wartime controls, there was\\nwidespread agreement- in developed and de-\\nveloping countries alike-that the state should\\nplay a major role in economic activity, not\\nonly in affecting aggregate demand, but also\\nin regulating private markets and indeed aug-\\nmenting or supplanting them with state-owned\\nenterprise production of manufactured and\\nother goods.

The Early Years\\nAs developing countries gained indepen-\\ndence from their former colonial rulers, 5 their\\nleaders had a political mandate to achieve\\nhigher living standards and rapid economic\\ngrowth.6 It is difficult in the 1990\\'s to recall\\nthe extent to which it was then plausible to\\nview the world economy as split into the in-\\ndustrialized countries and the underdeveloped\\ncountries, or \"first world\" and \"third world,\"\\nas they were often called. Underdeveloped\\ncountries had markedly lower average educa-\\ntional attainments (including a great deal of\\nilliteracy and a high fraction of the population\\nwith no schooling), poor health conditions,\\nand very little infrastructure. They were heav-\\nily specialized in the production and export of\\nprimary commodities and imported most of\\ntheir manufactured goods. While differences\\namong the underdeveloped countries were ac-\\nknowledged, these seemed minor contrasted\\nwith the overwhelming realities of their com-\\nmon attributes and widespread poverty.\\nThe new field of development economics\\nwas regarded by many as covering underdev-\\nelopment because \"conventional economics\"\\ndid not apply (see Albert Hirschman, 1982).\\nFocus on how the developing countries should\\nshape policies for accelerating growth and\\nraising living standards was the central issue.7\\nB. Accepted Stylized Facts and Premises\\nEarly trade and development theories and\\npolicy prescriptions were based on some\\nwidely accepted stylized facts and premises\\nabout the underdeveloped countries. These\\nwere a mixture of touristic impressions, half-\\ntruths, and misapplied policy inferences. In\\nhindsight, it is surprising how some then-\\naccepted stylized \"facts\" were so uncritically\\naccepted and held sway for so long. However,\\nit is not possible to understand what thinking\\nabout trade and development was except in\\nlight of those premises. Indeed, it can be ar-\\ngued that improved understanding of trade and\\ndevelopment came about in large part through\\nresearch which effectively demonstrated the\\nfalsity of these premises.\\nA first premise was based on the fact-then\\ncertainly true-that developing economies\\'\\nproduction structures were heavily oriented to-\\nward primary commodity production. The de-\\npendence on foreign trade was believed to be\\nextreme, as there was virtually no production\\ncapacity for manufactured goods outside a few\\nlight mass-consumed commodities. However,\\nmany observers went further and attributed the\\nlow living standards in developing countries\\nto dependence on primary commodity produc-\\ntion and export.\\nA second \"fact,\" or premise, was that if\\ndeveloping countries adopted policies of free\\ntrade, their comparative advantage would for-\\never lie in primary commodity production. It\\nfollowed that industrialization and, hence, de-\\nvelopment would not take place if free trade\\npolicies were adopted.\\nA third premise-termed \"export pessi-\\nmism\"-was that both the global income and\\nprice elasticities of demand for primary com-\\nmodities were low. Consequently, it was an-\\nticipated that export earnings would not grow\\nvery rapidly, if at all.8\\n\\n###',\n",

The stylized\\n\"fact\" that there was \"surplus\" labor, or\\ndisguised unemployment in less developed\\ncountries (LDCs) was widely accepted.9 In\\nmany analytical formulations, it was explic-\\nitly or implicitly assumed that labor was a\\nfree good while capital was the scarce factor\\nof production.\\'0\\nRelated to the fourth premise was a fifth\\npremise: that capital accumulation was crucial\\nfor growth, and in early stages of development\\nit could occur only with the importation of\\ncapital goods. Since it was expected that the\\ndemand for capital goods imports, and im-\\nports of other products used in the production\\nprocess, would grow rapidly while foreign\\nexchange earnings would not, it appeared that\\ngrowth could follow only if domestic produc-\\ntion of import-competing goods could expand\\nrapidly.\\nYet a sixth widely accepted premise was\\nthat there was very little response to price\\nincentives in developing countries: peasants\\nwere \"traditional\" in their behavior, and\\nthere were \"structural\" problems within the\\neconomy.\" \\'\\nBased on these stylized facts and premises, it\\nwas a straightforward step to believe that the\\nprocess of development was that of industriali-\\nzation, by which was essentially meant the\\naccumulation of capital for investment in man-\\nufacturing industry and related infrastructure.\\nMoreover, since most manufactured goods were\\nimported, it seemed to follow logically that, as\\nstated by Chenery (1958 p. 463) among many\\nothers: \"Industrialization consists primarily in\\nthe substitution of domestic production of man-\\nufactured goods for imports.\"\\nC. Initial Policies\\nPolicy prescriptions were derived from\\nthese propositions, or stylized facts. Since it\\nwas thought that industrialization was neces-\\nsary for development and that free trade would\\nleave underdeveloped countries specialized in\\nprimary commodity production, it followed\\nthat there had to be investment in new manu-\\nfacturing industries whose output would sub-\\nstitute for imports. Further, it was widely\\nbelieved that new industries in poor countries\\ncould not possibly compete with their estab-\\nlished counterparts in the developed world.\\nTherefore, industry would have to be protected\\nduring its initial phase. Import-substitution\\npolicies therefore became the hallmark of de-\\nvelopment strategies for manufacturing and\\nthe underlying rationale for trade policy.\"2\\nThe case for import substitution was based\\nboth on the premises outlined above and also\\non received doctrine: the infant industry ar-\\ngument. The notion that dynamic considera-\\ntions and externalities might imply that an\\nindustry, although economic, would not be es-\\ntablished by private agents had been accepted\\nby economists as a legitimate exception to the\\ncase for free trade since Hamilton and List.\"3\\ntended to demonstrate that at the very least the deteriora-\\ntion had been much less than was believed. John Spraos\\n(1980) provided a classic review of the evidence.  9 A modem interpretation would be that there are many\\npeople in developing countries with very low marginal\\nproducts of labor. While they are too poor to remain un-\\nemployed, the process of development entails equipping\\npeople with the capabilities (partly through education)\\nand opportunities to increase their productivity.\\n\\' To be sure, all analysts recognized the importance of\\nincreased provision of education and health services. But\\nfor purposes of analyzing trade policy, emphasis was al-\\nmost exclusively on investment.\\n\" This gave rise to a great deal of literature based on\\n\"structuralism.\" According to some, it was the absence\\nof responsiveness to price that made developing countries\\n\"different.\" Structuralism was also used as an argument\\nthat inflation was necessary in order to achieve growth.\\nSee Hollis B. Chenery ( 1975) for a fuller description.  2 There were many important subthemes that are not\\nelaborated here, since they are not essential to the main\\nargument. It should, however, be noted that there were\\nmany who believed that the situation of developing coun-\\ntries was \"structural\" and that marginal changes would\\nnot matter. It was then concluded that a \"big push\" was\\nneeded, with many new investments simultaneously gen-\\nerating additional demand and then becoming profitable.\\nRagnar Nurkse\\'s ( 1958) \"balanced growth\" prescription\\nreflected the same viewpoint.\\n\\'\" See Robert E.

However, in the\\npresence of dynamic externalities (presum-\\nably internal to the industry), it was believed\\nthat no individual producer would find it prof-\\nitable to start production. In these circum-\\nstances, the infant industry argument could\\njustify temporary intervention to make entry\\ninto the new industry privately profitable pro-\\nvided that, over the longer term, its costs\\nwould decline below the imported cost by\\nenough to yield an economic return on the in-\\ntervening loss, which could be viewed as an\\ninvestment.\\nAlthough the infant industry argument was,\\nin a first-best world, an argument for a pro-\\nduction subsidy (which would presumably\\nequal the unit value of the externality and\\nmight apply as well for production for exports\\nas for the domestic market), it was combined\\nwith the appeal for import substitution14 to\\nyield a justification for protection of newly es-\\ntablished manufacturing industries in devel-\\noping countries.\\nHowever, combining the assumptions that\\nindustrialization would have to take place\\nthrough substituting for imports, that there\\nwere infant industries requiring initial inter-\\nvention, and that export earnings were un-\\nlikely to increase, the stage was set for trade\\nand industrialization policies.\\nThe premises underlying import-substitution\\npolicies were so widely accepted that devel-\\noping country exceptions were even incorpo-\\nrated into the General Agreement on Tariffs\\nand Trade (GATT) articles. Article XVIII\\nexplicitly protected the developing countries\\nfrom the \"obligations\" of industrialized coun-\\ntries and permitted them to adopt tariffs and\\nquantitative restrictions. They also were enti-\\ntled to \"special and differential treatment\" in\\nother regards under GATT. That the GATT,\\nthe upholder of an open international trading\\nsystem, would accept an \"exception\" for\\ndeveloping countries shows how deeply en-\\ntrenched the views supporting import substi-\\ntution were.

Resulting Evolution of Policies\\nIn one way or another, provision was made\\nin country after country that, once domestic\\nproduction became feasible, imports would be\\nrestricted. In Brazil, a \"Law of Similars\" pro-\\nvided that firms importing goods that were\\nsimilar to those available domestically would\\nlose their government privileges, which in-\\ncluded not only access to credit and tax treat-\\nment, but also eligibility to bid on government\\ncontracts and a variety of other valuable rights.\\nIn India, imports were licensed, and in the\\nevent that there was domestic production, any\\nwould-be importer was required to obtain let-\\nters from any supplier government officials\\nthought might be capable of producing the\\ngood to the effect that the supplier could not\\nmeet the specifications. In Turkey, goods were\\nremoved from the list of items for which im-\\nport licenses could be granted once domestic\\nproduction capacity was available.

In that case, the trade regime\\nprovided protection to the state-owned enter-\\nprises, although their budget constraints were,\\nin any event, very soft. None of these policies,\\nas adopted, provided means of identifying\\nwhere dynamic externalities were largest, nor\\nwas there any provision for reduction of pro-\\ntection after an initial period.

That is, as countries embarked on\\nambitious development plans, inflation rates\\nrose to levels significantly above those in in-\\ndustrial countries (although far below inflation\\nrates prevailing in many developing countries\\ntoday). Demand for foreign exchange was ris-\\ning rapidly in response to the development\\nplans, rising incomes, and domestic inflation.\\nNonetheless, policy makers in most developing\\ncountries chose to maintain their fixed nominal\\nexchange rates.

Research Directions and Contributions\\nMost research in the 1950\\'s and 1960\\'s was\\nbased on the premises outlined above, and sup-\\nported the basic thrusts of policy. It needs only\\nbrief mention here. Some focussed on the pos-\\nsible existence of externalities and the need for\\n\"balanced growth,\" as it was assumed that\\nexpansion of any one industry alone would not\\nbe feasible because of the limited size of the\\nmarket.22 This prescription, of course, was\\nbased on the premise that development of\\nmanufactured exports was not feasible. An-\\nother line of supportive research focussed on\\nplanning models, concentrating in large part\\non interindustry flows and linkages.23 Empir-\\nical research on pattems of development be-\\ngan, focussing on the structure of economies\\nand their growth performance. For more than\\na decade, the growing disparity between the-\\nory and practice was all but ignored.\\nThere was also research providing a ration-\\nale for protection of new industries and import\\nsubstitution. These results demonstrated that\\ndomestic distortions could warrant trade inter-\\nvention24 in a number of situations. Everett E.\\nHagen (1958), in perhaps the best known of\\nthese, set up a model assuming that urban\\nwages exceeded rural wages exogenously, and\\ndemonstrated that a tariff could improve wel-\\nfare by inducing resources into the (artifi-\\ncially) higher-cost urban industries.\\nWork also continued on structuralist mod-\\nels, as a number of authors found reasons\\nwhy developing countries\\' economic struc-\\ntures were \"different\" and why, therefore, the\\nusual economic analysis would not apply.25\\nChenery and Michael Bruno (1962), Chenery\\nand Alan Strout (1966), and Chenery and\\nmany other coauthors developed the \"two-\\ngap\" model, using the stylized fact that\\nforeign exchange was \"scarce\" in devel-\\noping countries. In this model, export earnings\\nwere exogenously given and growing more\\nslowly than the demand for foreign exchange.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

There\\nwere thus two \"gaps\" -between savings and\\ninvestment, and between demand for, and\\nsupply of, foreign exchange. Growth was\\nconstrained either by savings or by foreign\\nexchange availability, and the model demon-\\nstrated the high potential productivity of for-\\neign aid (in providing foreign exchange),\\nenabling otherwise redundant domestic sav-\\nings to be used in capital formation. The\\nmodel, reflecting the views of the day, had lit-\\ntle role for the price mechanism.26\\nAn example of an analytical effort to clarify\\ncircumstances under which one of the stylized\\nfacts could be realized was Bhagwati\\'s ( 1958)\\nand Harry G.

As\\nBhagwati showed, the conditions under which\\nthat might happen were fairly extreme.\\nAn important development was the theory\\nof shadow pricing, which was an offshoot of\\nprogramming and planning models. It was ini-\\ntially used to demonstrate how reliance on\\nmarket prices might yield an inappropriate re-\\nsource allocation. Quickly, however, analysts\\npointed to the distortions between domestic\\nprices of import-competing and exportable\\ngoods because of the trade regime. There is\\nlittle doubt that cost-benefit techniques im-\\nproved project selection and enabled improved\\ngovernmental decision-making with, inter alia,\\nthe insistence on use of border prices. The\\npublication of the I. M. D. Little and James A.\\nMirrlees (1969) volume marked a milestone,\\nafter which there was almost no question about\\nthe appropriateness of using border prices in\\nproject evaluation.\\nIn a related and important development, the\\ntheory of effective protection was developed\\nby Johnson (1965a), W. M. Corden (1966),\\nBela Balassa (1965), and others, providing a\\nframework for analyzing the protection ac-\\ncorded to industries engaged in light process-\\ning and much higher value-added activities on\\na comparable basis. The notion of domestic\\nresource costs (Bruno, 1965; Krueger, 1966),\\nshowing the uneven allocation of resources to\\nearning and saving a unit of foreign exchange\\nacross activities, was developed to meet the\\nargument that market prices failed to reflect\\nopportunity cost. This research provided a tool\\nwith which economists could measure the\\nwide disparities in protection accorded to dif-\\nferent import-competing industries.\\nRecognizing that these estimates were based\\nin part on partial equilibrium analysis,27 a\\nnumber of researchers began work on devel-\\noping techniques for computing general equi-\\nlibrium results. Based on newly developed\\nsolution algorithms, techniques were devel-\\noped for models which endogenized prices,\\nand thus moved away from the linear models\\nearlier used for analysis.28\\nBy the late 1960\\'s and 1970\\'s, there were sig-\\nnificant contributions which undermined some\\nof the premises on which import-substitution\\nstrategies were based. At an analytical level,\\none line of research focussed on whether the\\nstylized facts of \"market failure\" in fact war-\\nranted the imposition of trade restrictions.\\nBhagwati and V. K.

The equivalence of tariffs and\\nquotas, an old result in international econom-\\nics, was revised and refined, as quotas became\\nmore frequently used.29\\nResearch also began analyzing other aspects\\nof the ways in which protection actually\\nworked.

East Asian Experience\\nAt the same time as evidence of the high\\ncosts of import-substitution regimes was ac-\\ncumulating, another important development\\noccurred. Starting first in Taiwan, several East\\nAsian economies began growing rapidly under\\npolicies diametrically opposite those prevalent\\nunder import substitution. Interestingly, the\\nTaiwanese government seems to have listened\\ncarefully to the views of S. C. Tsiang,3 1a pro-\\nfessor at Cornell University specializing in in-\\nternational economics. Following the precepts\\nof comparative advantage, Tsiang advocated\\ngrowth through industrialization, but with in-\\ndustrialization taking place through increased\\ncapacity for exports, as well as for the domes-\\ntic market. Taiwan\\'s transformation from a\\nhigh-inflation, inner-oriented, aid-dependent\\neconomy to a major exporting economy is well\\nknown.\\nKorea, whose initial conditions appeared, if\\nanything, even less conducive to growth than\\nthose of Taiwan, followed the same pattern. In\\nthe late 1950\\'s, Korea\\'s exports had averaged\\nonly 3 percent of gross domestic product\\n(GDP) and were growing slowly, if at all,\\nwhile imports represented 13 percent of GDP.\\nThe current account deficit was financed\\nlargely by foreign aid, and the domestic sav-\\nings rate was virtually zero. Major policy re-\\nforms took place in Korea in the early 1960\\'s,\\nwhich greatly increased the return to export-\\ners. There were fairly uniform incentives to\\nall exporters and assurances that the real\\nexchange rate would not appreciate to their\\ndetriment. Reforms also reduced the protec-\\ntion to import-competing producers and per-\\nmitted exporters duty-free importation of needed\\nintermediate goods and raw materials.\\nThe Korean economic performance was\\ntransformed, as growth rates entered the\\ndouble-digit range and living standards\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Finally, what types of research\\nwere most (and least) productive in bringing\\nabout better understanding of the role of trade\\nand trade policy in development? I address\\nthese questions in turn.\\nThe first is the issue of how the principle of\\ncomparative advantage could have been so\\nblithely abandoned. With hindsight, it is al-\\nmost incredible that such a high fraction of\\neconomists could have deviated so far from\\nthe basic principles of international trade.\\nWhat led them to do so? Can any lessons be\\ndrawn to avoid (or shorten the duration of)\\nsimilar mistakes in other applied fields when\\nnew policy problems arise?\\nBut, recall the stylized facts that were\\nwidely accepted. People were thought not to\\nrespond to incentives; exports earnings were\\nthought to be predetermined and slowly grow-\\ning at best; industrialization was necessary for\\ndevelopment; supply response was lacking;\\nand so on. These stylized facts, which were at\\nbest simplistic and in most instances simply\\nwrong, permitted economists to conclude that\\ndeveloping economies were \"different.\"\\nHowever, it took theory to support these\\nconclusions. Here, one can distinguish several\\nfailures. First, there was misapplication of\\ngood theory. Second, there was what I shall\\ncall the \"theory of negative results,\" which\\nessentially could be used to provide a rationale\\nfor virtually any trade intervention. Third,\\nthere was good theory harnessed to erroneous\\nstylized facts.\\nA. Misapplication of Good Theory\\nMisapplication of good theory was sig-\\nnificant.37 The identification of comparative\\nadvantage with the two-factor, two-good\\nmodel, and the assumption that free trade\\nwould imply that developing countries would\\nforever specialize in primary commodities,\\nwas an important misapplication. One of the\\npuzzling aspects of the evolution of thinking\\nabout policy is the degree to which proponents\\nof open trade regimes failed to refute the al-\\nlegation that free trade would forever leave de-\\nveloping countries specialized in production\\nof agricultural commodities.38\\nIt was not until the 1970\\'s (see Ronald W.\\nJones, 197 ib; Krueger, 1977) that models-\\nmotivated in part by the East Asian experience-\\nwere developed in which three factors of\\nproduction (land, labor, and capital) were al-\\nlocated among sectors, each of which could\\nproduce many commodities. As the three-\\nfactor models demonstrated, comparative ad-\\nvantage lies within manufacturing and within\\nagriculture, and not between them. Thus, poor\\nunskilled, labor-abundant countries have a\\ncomparative advantage in labor-intensive ag-\\nricultural and unskilled labor-intensive man-\\nufactured commodities, while countries with\\na much higher land-labor ratio have a com-\\nparative advantage in more land-using agri-\\ncultural commodities and their comparative\\nadvantage in manufacturing lies more in goods\\nwith higher capital-unskilled labor ratios. In\\nthese models, the overall trade balance in man-\\nufactures is a function of the size of the man-\\nufacturing sector, itself a function of past\\ncapital accumulation and the land-man ratio.\\nA second serious misapplication of good\\ntheory arose because of the nonoperational\\nnature of the theory itself, and the failure to\\nidentify circumstances under which policy im-\\nplementation might be incentive compatible\\nand potentially increase welfare. A key culprit\\nin this case was the interpretation of the infant\\nindustry argument. As I already discussed, it\\nwas widely touted as a basis for import sub-\\nstitution, and generally recognized as a \"le-\\ngitimate\" case for a departure from free trade.\\nOne can hardly argue with the proposition\\nthat the presence of a positive externality gives\\nrise to a basis for intervention; if the external-\\nity is dynamic and temporary, then temporary\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'intervention, such as infant industry protec-\\ntion, can be called for.\\nThe problem with the argument, as a basis\\nfor policy, is that it fails to provide any guid-\\nance as to how to distinguish between an infant\\nthat will grow up and a would-be producer\\nseeking protection because it is privately prof-\\nitable. It is not even clear how one could begin,\\nempirically, to identify the domain of the\\nexternality. Moreover, even if there were a\\nproducer or producers whose increased pro-\\nduction would generate dynamic externalities,\\nit does not follow that any level of protection\\nis warranted. And there is nothing in the infant\\nindustry argument to provide guidance for\\nquantifying or estimating the likely magnitude\\nof the externality.\\nIndiscriminate protection in developing\\ncountries was defended on infant industry\\ngrounds with arguments of capital market fail-\\nure, labor market failure (as the costs of train-\\ning, presumably, would be borne by first\\nentrants into industries and then not recouped\\nas others hired workers away), costs of in-\\nvestments in technology, and uncertainty all\\nused. It was not until Baldwin\\'s (1969) sem-\\ninal article that it was demonstrated that, even\\nwhen the presumed imperfection existed, it\\nwas unlikely that infant industry protection\\nwould help correct it. As Baldwin cogently ar-\\ngued, later entrants to an industry might speed\\nup their investments if protection made do-\\nmestic production more profitable, and the first\\nentrant might even be worse off! It was only\\nafter critical examination of these circum-\\nstances that the defenders of the infant indus-\\ntry case for import substitution became less\\nvehement.\\nThe infant industry argument also is an\\nexcellent example of a theory that is nonoper-\\national because criteria for bureaucrats to iden-\\ntify cases have not been put forward. Quite\\naside from the unpredictability and immeasur-\\nability of the future time path of costs in new\\nfactories and the moral hazard associated with\\nasking individual entrepreneurs to indicate\\nhow much protection they need, there is noth-\\ning to my knowledge in the literature speci-\\nfying how the policy maker might instruct a\\nbureaucrat to identify (much less measure) a\\ndynamic externality if it were present, how an\\nincentive-compatible mechanism might be de-\\nvised for improving welfare, how the bureau-\\ncrat might measure the height of warranted\\nprotection, nor how policy makers might cred-\\nibly commit to temporary protection. Even ex\\npost, it is not entirely clear how one might\\nidentify an industry as a successful infant: sim-\\nply because a firm became profitable and ex-\\nported does not prove that there was either an\\nexternality or a dynamic process at work! 9\\nB. Negative Results\\nMuch of the theorizing that took place was\\nconcerned with what I call \"negative results.\"\\nThat is, analysts sought to find reasons why,\\nfor example, an exception to free trade should\\nbe made. Once the principle of comparative\\nadvantage was laid down as a basis for policy,\\nthere was little left for theorists to prove sup-\\nporting an open trading system, so the chal-\\nlenge to theorists was to find conditions under\\nwhich the free trade precept did not hold. As\\ntheory, these findings were significant, but for\\npolicy they were unhelpful, and probably\\nserved to perpetuate inappropriate policies.\\nIn most real-world circumstances, one\\nstrongly suspects that protection exists where\\ntheoretical exceptions do not justify it, and that\\nmoves to first-best policies would on average\\nlower, and not raise, protection. Judged by that\\nmetric, research output relevant for policy\\nwould consist more of attempts to measure the\\ncosts of these excess levels of protection.

       " 'national economics courses, sections on trade\\npolicy spend considerable time addressing na-\\ntional defense exceptions, the optimum tariff\\nargument, the infant industry argument, second-\\nbest arguments, and other arguments for pro-\\ntection. While attention is paid to the reasons\\nwhy these arguments may not be correct, focus\\nnonetheless centers on the exceptions to the\\ncase for free trade, rather than on the reasons\\nfor it. While this may be inevitable as a way\\nof reasoning, the temptation to draw inappro-\\npriate inferences seems high.\\nAn example will illuminate the argument.\\nWhereas theory suggests criteria for depar-\\ntures from laissez-faire free trade which nor-\\nmally would result in different levels of\\nprotection for different industries, a widely\\nused prescription for policy makers is that, if\\nthere is to be protection, a uniform tariff is\\nusually preferable to any alternative structVre.\\nThis proposition rests on several considera-\\ntions. First, only a uniform tariff can generate\\na uniform rate of effective protection in the\\nimport-competing sectors and, if different\\ngoods are subject to different rates of tariff,\\nthe resulting differences in effective rates of\\nprotection will lead to resource misallocation\\neven within the import-competing industries\\nand have no relation to underlying \"dynamic\"\\nor market-failure considerations. Second, a\\nuniform tariff simplifies customs administra-\\ntion, making evasion and/or bribery of cus-\\ntoms officials more difficult than a varying rate\\nstructure. Third, a uniform tariff greatly re-\\nduces the opportunities for resource losses in\\nrent-seeking and lobbying. Fourth, given in-\\nternational prices, international value added is\\nmore likely to be maximized under a uniform\\ntariff structure than under a variable one.\\nNone of these arguments is sufficient to\\nprove that a uniform tariff is optimal. And, in-\\ndeed, it is straightforward to develop models\\nin which a uniform tariff is nonoptimal, es-\\npecially in the presence of income-distribution\\nconsiderations. In theory, the costs of pro-\\ntection can be minimized by imposing higher\\ntariffs or taxes on goods whose supply and de-\\nmand is relatively more price inelastic.\\nThose arguments, as put forward, are all\\ncouched in terms of demonstrating the \"falsity\"\\nof the proposition that a uniform tariff is pref-\\nerable to variable tariff rates and that there is a\\ndeparture from uniformity that can potentially\\nimprove welfare. But the difficulty with that for-\\nmulation is that it does not provide a criterion\\nfor which departures from uniformity might\\nimprove welfare, because a model considering,\\nfor example, income-distribution considerations,\\ncannot simultaneously address issues of corrup-\\ntion and administration. And, the fact that\\nincome-distribution considerations can warrant a\\nnonuniform tariff structure does not prove that\\nany nonuniform tariff structure is preferable to\\na uniform one! As such, a negative result gives\\nlittle or no guide for policy. Nonetheless, it arms\\nlobbyists and others with ammunition to dis-\\ncredit technocrats\\' efforts to maintain a less ir-\\nrational structure of protection.\\nSome good theoretical papers would have\\ndone less damage, or at least given less aid and\\ncomfort to policy positions that were clearly\\nnot those intended in the analyses, if the au-\\nthors had taken greater pains to note the lim-\\nitations to their analyses, and the other factors\\nthat would have to be taken into account, be-\\nfore their results were applied to policy.\\nIn that regard, it is often overlooked that most\\npolicy implementation is carried out by govern-\\nment officials who cannot be expected to have\\nadvanced degrees, and sometimes even under-\\ngraduate degrees, in economics. In many in-\\nstances (including formulae for optimal tariff\\ndifferentiation), the degree of sophistication\\nneeded to interpret research results is well be-\\nyond that which most bureaucrats will have. As\\npointed out by Johnson (1970 p. 101):\\n...The fundamental problem is that, as\\nwith all second-best arguments, determi-\\nnation of the conditions under which a\\nsecond-best policy actually leads to an\\nimprovement in social welfare requires\\ndetailed theoretical and empirical inves-\\ntigation by a first-best economist ... it is\\ntherefore very unlikely that a second-best\\nwelfare optimum will result based on\\nsecond-best arguments.\\nC.

Yet their claims\\noften went beyond the assertion that \"if these\\nfacts ... then\" variety.\\nAs an example to illustrate the point, I have\\ndeliberately chosen a good, widely cited paper,\\nbecause the paper represents good theory, but\\ninterprets it, for policy purposes, with dubious\\n\"stylized facts.\" Sudhir Anand and Vijay Joshi\\n(1979) considered a world, such as that envis-\\naged by Hagen ( 1958), in which workers in the\\nadvanced sector receive a higher wage than in\\nthe rest of the economy due to unions or other\\n(presumably unalterable) circumstances. They\\nthen asked whether maximizing international\\nvalue added for given employment of domestic\\nresources is an appropriate criterion when\\nincome-distribution considerations cannot be sep-\\narated from productive-efficiency considerations.\\nIn their setup, the clear answer is no, because\\ntradeables are produced by the advanced (pre-\\nsumably unionized) sector, and hence maxi-\\nmizing international value will pull more\\nresources into that sector at the cost of a dete-\\nriorating income distribution. Interestingly,\\nthey do not address the question of whether the\\nadvanced sector is labor or capital intensive. If,\\nas is true for outer-oriented developing coun-\\ntries, the exportables are labor intensive relative\\nto import-competing activity, removing protec-\\ntion to induce a move of more workers to the\\n\"advanced\" high-wage sector would presum-\\nably increase wages of those workers and also\\nthose in the rest of the economy: a more equal\\nincome distribution would be obtained at the\\nexpense of lower real wages for all. Without\\nregard to factor intensity, however, Anand and\\nJoshi (1979 p. 350) conclude that:\\nThe motivation behind the theory of dis-\\ntortions has been to criticise and to guide\\ntrade and industrialisation policies ...\\nOur analysis emphasises the need for\\ncaution ... Departures from technical ef-\\nficiency may be called for as part of the\\nrational response by governments to the\\nlimitations they face in carrying out de-\\nsirable income distribution policies ...40\\nAnand and Joshi ( 1979) assumed that mov-\\ning toward economic efficiency in tradeables\\nrequires paying higher wages because of a dis-\\ntortion. Yet, in fact, the evidence suggests that\\nit has been the highly protected, import-\\ncompeting industries which have been able to\\npay above-average wages; removing protec-\\ntion has led to rapid expansion of employment\\nin labor-intensive industries. If the latter stylized\\nfact is correct, and if income-distribution consid-\\nerations are important, it would suggest that\\nthe policy implications of the Anand-Joshi\\nanalysis are the opposite of what they sug-\\ngest-namely, that policy makers should en-\\ncourage, even beyond the optimum, a shift of\\nresources out of protected industries (presum-\\nably by removing protection) and into export-\\nable industries.4\"\\nIII.

Second, and\\nnot unrelated to the first, there was the refine-\\nment and more appropriate interpretation of\\ntheory. Third, there was research demonstrat-\\ning the feasibility of the alternative.\\nA. Challenging the Stylized Facts and\\nUnderstanding How Import-Substitution\\nRegimes Worked\\nAnalyses of the evidence regarding the key\\nstylized facts were in hindsight important steps\\nin undermining the intellectual consensus.\\nDemonstration that there were significant re-\\nsponses to incentives undermined the policy\\ncase for ignoring prices. Proof that the terms\\nof trade had deteriorated very little, if at all,\\nbegan to undermine export pessimism.\\nEmpirical work on the ways in which\\nimport-substitution regimes functioned was\\ncrucial. Comparative analyses such as those\\nof Little et al. (1970), Bhagwati (1978),\\nKrueger ( 1978, 1983 ), and Michael Michaely\\net al. ( 1991 ) clearly contributed signifi-\\ncantly to awareness that the effects of import-\\nsubstitution policies were not idiosyncratic to\\nindividual countries. The comparative studies\\nprovided a great deal of evidence as to the\\nshortcomings of reliance on import substitu-\\ntion. Evidence that protection was not tem-\\nporary, that protection levels were high and\\nidiosyncratic, that there was very great dis-\\ncrimination against exports, and that \"foreign\\nexchange shortage\" was a function of policies\\nand not an exogenously given datum, were all\\nimportant in challenging the protectionist trade\\npolicies still prevailing in most developing\\ncountries in the 1980\\'s.\\nIf one considered the evidence regarding the\\nworkings of trade policies in any one country\\ntaken alone, there were ample grounds for crit-\\nicism of inner-oriented trade policies, with the\\nmonopoly positions they conferred on domes-\\ntic producers, the high costs of doing business,\\nrent-seeking low quality of products, and so\\non. It was possible, however, to recognize that\\nand nonetheless conclude that policy makers\\nin that particular country had been inept, or\\nhad simply failed to implement policies appro-\\npriately. As evidence mounted across coun-\\ntries, the similarity in the evolution of regimes\\nand their consequences was striking. It was in-\\ncreasingly difficult to dismiss the evidence\\nfrom a particular country as being sui generis\\nor the failing only of the particulars of policy\\nexecution in that country.\\nBut, underpinning the analyses of indivi-\\ndual country situations, either in the compar-\\native studies or individually, were agreed-upon\\nmeasurement tools. The empirical studies\\ncould not have had their impact without the\\ndevelopment and use of measurement tools.\\nAs cost-benefit techniques were used, it be-\\ncame increasingly difficult to justify some\\nhighly uneconomic projects. And, as measure-\\nment of effective rates of protection was un-\\ndertaken in country after country, the high and\\nerratic nature of protection became evident.\\nTechniques for cost-benefit analysis and mea-\\nsurement of effective rates of protection were\\nimportant, first of all, in providing analysts\\nwith tools with which to demonstrate the cha-\\notic nature of import-substitution policies. In\\naddition, even before the policy consensus\\nchanged, there is little doubt that some of the\\nearlier extreme irrationalities of policy were\\ncurbed through use of these tools. It became\\nextremely difficult to defend the high average\\nof, and wide variance in, effective rates of\\nprotection.\\nAt an empirical level, it seems clear that early\\ndemonstrations of the great range of variation in\\nrates of effective protection were useful both in\\ndemonstrating some of the problems with trade\\nregimes and also in preventing at least a few of\\nthe worst excesses that might otherwise have oc-\\ncuffed.

In early policy pre-\\nscriptions, there had been something of a naive\\ntendency to assume that enunciating a desired\\noutcome was itself sufficient to achieve it.\\nThis naivete was dispelled, as the theories re-\\ngarding bureaucratic behavior, rent-seeking,\\nsmuggling, and overinvoicing and underin-\\nvoicing all enabled observers to examine more\\ncritically the ways in which alternative policy\\nprescriptions might have side effects that had\\nearlier been unanticipated.\\nB. Refinement and More Appropriate\\nInterpretation of Theory\\nAs already seen, some of the intellectual un-\\nderpinning of import-substitution policies was\\nprovided by inappropriate interpretation of\\ntheory, or the failure of theory to take into ac-\\ncount key institutional or behavioral variables.\\nAnalytical developments focussing on condi-\\ntions under which these interpretations were\\nvalid, or examining the ways in which results\\nhad to be modified to take into account these\\ninstitutional and behaviorial aspects, were\\nclearly important in improving understanding.\\nThe entire literature on optimal interven-\\ntions in the presence of domestic distortions is\\none important example of a demonstration that\\nearlier interpretations of theory had failed to\\nexamine the relevant alternatives. It was in-\\nvaluable in demonstrating clearly that in most\\ncircumstances, the presence of a distortion\\nwarranted a first-best policy intervention other\\nthan a tariff.43 For example, in the case of\\nHagen\\'s (1958) employment-generating case\\nfor protection, the optimal intervention litera-\\nture demonstrated clearly that a first-best in-\\ntervention would be in the labor market, and\\nthat a tariff or quota could not achieve a first-\\nbest outcome.\\nSimilarly, developments showing that the\\ncomparative advantage results were not the\\nsimple \"specialize forever in primary prod-\\nucts\" precept proved significant in enabling\\npolicy makers to contemplate alteration in\\ntrade strategy. Baldwin\\'s (1969) critical ex-\\namination of the infant industry argument pro-\\nvides yet another example of an analytical\\ncontribution that was important in making\\nthose concerned with policy consider carefully\\nthe effectiveness of the policies they had\\nadopted in achieving their desired goals.\\nFinally, there was theory that was developed\\nin response to the functioning of import-\\nsubstitution regimes. Here again, the theory of\\nrent-seeking, as it pointed to the ways in which\\nbureaucrats and others made protection very\\ncostly, was important. Further, when it was\\nrecognized that bureaucrats, businessmen, and\\nothers attempted to capture or thwart policy\\ninitiatives not in their self-interest and that\\nthey acquired an interest in maintaining the\\nsystem, once established, and that resources\\nwere expended in operating the system, it had\\nto be recognized that changing the system\\nwould be politically difficult.\\nDevelopment of a better understanding of\\nthe incentives for underinvoicing and overin-\\nvoicing of exports and imports and for smug-\\ngling under exchange-control regimes worked\\nin the same direction: not only could these ac-\\ntivities prove costly to the exchequer and in\\nterms of resource drains, but the very recog-\\nnition of their presence served to remind\\npolicy makers of the limitations of their\\ninstruments.\\nFinally, good analyses demonstrating how\\nindividual import controls actually worked\\ncontributed to understanding and made em-\\npirical work more effective. The further\\nrefinement of theory showing tariff-quota\\nequivalence has already been mentioned.\\nRent-seeking again comes to mind. But, in\\naddition, individual mechanisms for encour-\\naging import substitution each had their\\nown, often idiosyncratic, incentive effects.

In a way, research on East Asian\\nexperience provided a final blow to the earlier\\nuncritical acceptance of the stylized facts. For,\\nthe East Asian experiences demonstrated, as\\nnothing else could have, the feasibility and vi-\\nability of alternative trade policies: it was no\\nlonger possible to associate comparative ad-\\nvantage with reliance on primary commodity\\nexports, and the East Asian experience cer-\\ntainly put an end to the belief that developing\\ncountries could not develop rapidly when re-\\nlying on integration with the international\\neconomy.'\\nThe experience of the East Asian exporters\\ndid several things. Most important, it provided\\nconcrete evidence that a developing country\\ncould achieve industrialization without relying\\non domestic markets to absorb almost all\\nadditional output. That demonstrated the fal-\\nlacy of the earlier view that industrialization\\ncould take place only through import substi-\\ntution.45 Also, the East Asian trade regimes of-\\nfered significant opportunities for empirical\\nresearch, and the evidence mounted that prop-\\nerties formerly thought to be those of all de-\\nveloping countries were, in fact, properties\\nresulting from inner-oriented trade and pay-\\nments regimes.\\nIt cannot be said that either research results\\nor the contrast in economic performance alone\\nled to the change in policies in other devel-\\noping countries.46 Both research (especially\\nthat which brought the sharply contrasting ex-\\nperiences of the East Asian exporters and the\\nimport-substituting countries into focus) and\\nexperience contributed.\\nWhether one should regard the East Asian\\nexperience as entirely separate from economic\\ntheory, however, is an interesting question. As\\nalready mentioned, Tsiang (1985) was him-\\nself an international economist, and it was in\\nsignificant part his efforts that led the Tai-\\nwanese authorities to abandon inner-oriented\\npolicies and attempt to develop through ex-\\nports. The theory of comparative advantage\\nwas, at least in that instance, a pillar on which\\npolicy was built. And, while a variety of fac-\\ntors no doubt contributed to the Korean adop-\\ntion of outer-oriented trade policies after 1960,\\nthe favorable experience of Taiwan undoubt-\\nedly facilitated the willingness of decision\\nmakers to try the new approach.\\nThe East Asian exporters put to rest the\\nmistaken belief that developing countries re-\\nlying on the international market would forever\\nbe specialized in the production of primary\\ncommodities.

Pio-\\nneered by Zvi Griliches (1960, 1963), it was\\nutilized by Edward F. Denison (1967) and\\nJohn W. Kendrick (1973, 1976, 1977), among\\nothers. This approach has been further devel-\\noped and carried to a high art by Dale W.\\nJorgenson and Griliches ( 1967), Jorgenson et\\nal. (1987), and Jorgenson (1995).\\nThe main point to be made here is that once\\nthe residual is measured using a framework\\nlike (2) or its equivalent, the direct, measured\\ncontribution of human capital is captured in\\nthe labor term 1wiALi. By direct contribution\\nI mean what people are paid for. Doctors earn\\nmore than nurses, and engineers more than\\ndraftsmen. These and similar differences are\\ncaptured in D;FiALi, which can be positive\\neven if XALi is zero, just from an upward re-\\nshuffling of the same labor force. A truly ac-\\ncurate measurement of type (2) would capture\\nall the subtle differences of quality that exist\\nin a modem labor force and would give each\\na weight corresponding to the (gross-of-tax)\\nearnings that demanders are observed to pay.\\nWe may do this imperfectly, but, in concept at\\nleast, the residual R\\' as measured by (2) does\\nnot contain any elements of quality change or\\nany direct contributions of human capital to\\ngrowth. This is a quite important point for it\\npermits us to zero in on the residual as repre-\\nsenting \"technical change,\" \"TFP improve-\\nment,\" and \"real cost reduction.\"\\nThere is no analytical reason to prefer one\\nof the above three terms over another, in re-\\nferring to the residual R\\'. But I am going a bit\\nout on a limb to say that a term like \"technical\\nchange\" leads most economists to think of in-\\nventions, of the products of research and de-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

On the other hand, TFP\\nimprovement, once purged of the changes in\\nthe quality of labor and/or the direct contri-\\nbutions of human capital, makes one think of\\nexternalities of different kinds -economies of\\nscale, spillovers, and systematic complemen-\\ntarities. And finally, real cost reduction, to my\\nmind, makes one think like an entrepreneur or\\na CEO, or a production manager.\\nI think it would be perfectly fair to char-\\nacterize my presentation today as a paean in\\npraise of \"real cost reduction\" as a standard\\nlabel for R\\'. Labels do not change the un-\\nderlying reality, but they may change the\\nway we look at it and the way we think about\\nit. They also can lead us to understand it bet-\\nter. Thinking in terms of real cost reduction\\nhas certainly done all this for me, as I have\\ntried to sort out the many puzzles and com-\\nplexities that surround the process of eco-\\nnomic growth.\\nLet me try to take you down the path I trav-\\neled. In the first place, real cost reduction\\n(RCR) is probably on the mind of most busi-\\nness executives, production managers, etc., at\\nsome point or another in any given week, let\\nalone in any given month or year. It is a major\\npath to profit in good times, and a major de-\\nfense against adversity in bad times. Most U.S.\\nfirms that have downsized in recent years did\\nso with RCR in mind. So, too, did the firms\\nthat computerized their payrolls and other ac-\\ncounts. And so also did those who shifted to\\nwhat they considered more modern manage-\\nment techniques. I recall going through a\\nclothing plant in Central America, where the\\nowner informed me of a 20-percent reduction\\nin real costs, following upon his installation of\\nbackground music that played as the seam-\\nstresses worked. And then there is the story of\\ntwo Chilean refrigerator firms that ended up as\\nparts of a single conglomerate at one point.\\nThe new management reduced the number of\\nmodels from something like 24 to two, making\\nagreements to import other models while ex-\\nporting these two. The end result was that out-\\nput more than doubled, while the labor force\\nwas cut to less than half, and even the capital\\nstock (at replacement cost) was significantly\\nreduced. This sounds like (alnd is really) econ-\\nomies of scale, but they would not be detected\\nby our usual measures, as both labor force and\\ncapital stock went down. And we all have seen\\ncases where, say, an office\\'s real costs were\\nreduced when a martinet of a manager was re-\\nplaced by someone more reasonable. But we\\nhave also seen cases where real costs were re-\\nduced when a very lax manager was replaced\\nby someone more strict.\\nIt has long been my song that there are at\\nleast 1001 ways to reduce real costs and that\\nmost of them are actually followed in one part\\nor other of any modem complex economy,\\nover any plausible period (say, a decade).\\nOnce one accepts this proposition as true, the\\nquestion then arises: Why would anybody try\\nto settle on just one underlying cause of real\\ncost reduction? The answer, I think, is mind-\\nset-the framework in which one is thinking\\nat the moment. The pioneer writings of the re-\\ncent endogenous growth literature can, I think,\\nbe said to reflect a kind of annoyance at some-\\nthing like R or R\\' being considered exogenous.\\nThere was an urge to surmount that inelegance\\nby somehow making the residual endogenous.\\nAnd in a simple growth model that meant gen-\\nerating a feedback from the rest of the model\\nto the residual. A 1001 feedbacks would be out\\nof the question, but one feedback would work\\njust fine. Thus Paul Romer (1986) focused on\\na feedback through \"knowledge,\" with the\\nstock of knowledge shifting production func-\\ntions all over the economy; Robert E. Lucas,\\nJr. (1988) focused on \"human capital,\" not\\non its direct and remunerated productivity, but\\non the externalities that each increase in the\\nstock of human capital were presumed to gen-\\nerate. These single feedbacks achieved the\\nlimited purpose of endogenizing R or R\\'\\nwithin a specified model, but they did not rep-\\nresent very well the multifaceted nature of real\\ncost reduction as we observe it in actuality.\\nAnd, in point of fact, both the cited authors in\\ntheir more recent writings display a deep rec-\\nognition of the subtlety and complexity of the\\ngrowth process, not really capable of being\\ncaptured through a simple feedback mecha-\\nnism. (See Romer, 1990, 1994a, b; Lucas,\\n1993.)\\nSo, real cost reduction is multifaceted and\\neverywhere around us. Where does that get us?\\nOr how can we get anywhere in the face of\\nsuch complexity? The next step is to recognize\\nthat in spite of its complexity, real cost reduc-\\ntion can be reduced to a single metric, and can\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

For a quick appreciation of\\nthis, assume that total factor productivity grew\\nby 80 percent in one industry over a decade,\\nby 60 percent in another industry, and by 50\\npercent in a third. If their initial value added\\namounted to $100 billion, $200 billion, and\\n$300 billion, respectively, then the real cost\\nreduction of the first was $80 billion, that of\\nthe second was $120 billion, and that of the\\nthird $150 billion. So we can say that, mea-\\nsured at initial prices, the real cost reduction\\nof the three together was $350 billion over the\\ndecade in question. I truly think that the notion\\nof real cost reduction being additive in this\\nway came to my mind, and is easily seen by\\nothers, just as a consequence of the label. The\\nidea of additivity does not follow nearly so\\neasily from the labels \"technical advance\"\\nand \"total factor productivity.\"\\nAnyway, this vision of the growth process\\nopens up many new vistas and gives us many\\nnew challenges. To me, it gives life to the re-\\nsidual, viewed as real cost reduction, in a way\\nthat remote macroeconomic externalities\\nnever did. It gives the residual body, in the\\nsense that the number of dollars saved by real\\ncost reduction is a tangible and measurable\\nquantity. It gives the residual a name (real cost\\nreduction), an address (the firm), and a face\\n(the face of the entrepreneur, the CEO, the\\nproduction manager, etc.) And, finally, we\\nshall see that there can be vastly different ex-\\npressions on that face, even as we move from\\nfirm to firm in a given industry, as the TFP\\nexperience of a period moves from sharply\\npositive to devastatingly negative.\\nI. Yeast versus Mushrooms: Part I\\nTable 1 is based on the numerical example\\njust given, plus the information that the re-\\nmaining industries (say, in the economy) to-\\ngether had an initial value added of $1,400\\nbillion and experienced real cost reduction of\\n$150 billion over the period. Setting out data\\nin the format of Table 1 allows us to make\\nstatements like \"15 percent ($300 b./$2,000\\nb.) of the industries (measured by initial value\\nadded) accounted for 40 percent ($200 b./\\n$500 b.) of the real cost reduction (RCR) of\\nthe period\" and \"30 percent ($600 b./$2,000\\nb.) of the industries accounted for 70 percent\\n($350 b./$500 b.) of the period\\'s RCR.\"\\nI stumbled on this way of presenting data on\\nreal cost reduction in the course of writing a\\nbackground paper (Harberger, 1990) for the\\nWorld Bank\\'s World Development Report of\\n1991. Once I saw it, I immediately embraced\\nit, because it helped me communicate to others\\nwhat I call the \"yeast versus mushrooms\" is-\\nsue. The analogy with yeast and mushrooms\\ncomes from the fact that yeast causes bread to\\nexpand very evenly, like a balloon being filled\\nwith air, while mushrooms have the habit of\\npopping up, almost overnight, in a fashion that\\nis not easy to predict. I believe that a \"yeast\"\\nprocess fits best with very broad and general\\nexternalities, like externalities linked to the\\ngrowth of the total stock of knowledge or of\\nhuman capital, or brought about by economies\\nof scale tied to the scale of the economy as a\\nwhole.

I\\nremember being impressed, when I first saw\\nsome early industry estimates of TFP improve-\\nment, by their tendency to industry concentra-\\ntion. For years I told my students that the\\n1920\\'s were the decade of cars and rubber\\ntires, the 1930\\'s the decade of refrigerators,\\nthe 1940\\'s that of pharmaceuticals (especially\\nantibiotics), and the 1950\\'s that of television,\\nwith telecommunications anid computers tak-\\ning over in recent decades.

My real turnaround came in the course\\nof writing my 1990 paper, where I presented\\na series of tables based on Kendrick and Elliot\\nS. Grossman\\'s (1980) work. Table 2 is an\\nexample.\\nTable 2 has the same format as Table 1. Col-\\numn (1) presents the familiar measure of the\\npercentage by which TFP grew, or real costs\\nwere reduced, during the period in question\\n(note that the percentages apply to the period\\n1958-1967 as a whole; they are not annual\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The results are shown in colunm\\n(2). Columns (3) and (5) are the cumulative\\nsums of columns (2) and (4), respectively.\\nWorking with these figures one can make\\nstatements like those at the bottom of the\\ntable-i.e., the top 10 percent of industries\\naccounted for 30 percent of total real cost re-\\nduction; the top 22 percent of industries (mea-\\nsured by initial value added) accounted for\\nmore than half of total real cost reduction.\\nReaders will notice that at the foot of each\\ncolumn in the table is an entry refering to 18\\nadditional industries, which together accounted\\nfor only 10 percent of the total TFP contribuition,\\nwhile their combined share of initial output was\\nalmost 60 percent of the total.\\nUsing the analogy with yeast and mushrooms,\\nthe results of my calculations using the\\nKendrick-Grossman data pointed very clearly to\\na \"nmushrooms\" interpretation. Not only were\\nthe contributions to RCR highly conicentrated in\\na relatively few industries, these industries also\\nwere very different as one shifted from decade\\nspan to decade span. The top four branches in\\npercentage of real cost reduction during 1948-\\n1958 were Communications, Public Utilities,\\nFarming, and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. In\\n1958-1967 they were Lumber, Railroad Trans-\\nport, Textile Mills, and Electrical Machinery. In\\n1967-1976 they were Finance, Insurance &\\nReal Estate, Apparel, Communications, and\\nChemicals. Only Communications appears twice\\namong these 12 listings.\\nNow to my mind, this already brings\\nevidence to bear on a number of possible hy-\\npotheses concerning the nature of TFP\\nimprovement. Certainly some ways of inter-\\npreting a generalized externality due to im-\\nproved education would be hard to justify\\nusing evidence like this. Strong links of the\\nresidual term to R&D expenditures\\' would\\nsuggest a high degree of persistence among the\\nleaders in TFP improvement. So also (proba-\\nbly) would economies of scale associated with\\nthe scale either of the firm or of the industry.\\nSuch economies are not likely to jump wildly\\naround from one industry to the next, from pe-\\nriod to period. One would expect them to em-\\nbody characteristics of the productive process\\nthat would be relatively stable over time;\\nhence they should show a reasonably high de-\\ngree of persistence, over time, in terms of the\\nTFP experience of particular industries.\\nNo economist can look at Table 2 without\\nthinking of its close analogy with a Lorenz\\ncurve. That, indeed, was the next step I took\\nin trying to represent the degree of concentra-\\ntion of real cost reduction. Figure 1 (drawn\\nfrom Edgar Robles, 1997), shows the quasi-\\nLorenz curves for a 20-industry breakdown of\\nthe U.S. manufacturing sector over four suc-\\ncessive five-year periods.\\nWhat strikes one immediately about Figure\\n1 is the characteristic \"overshooting.\" I have\\nmarked withi the first vertical line the point\\nwhere the rising curve crosses 100 percent on\\nthe vertical axis. The interpretation is that in\\n1970-1975 the cumulative real cost reduction\\nof just 25 percent of manufacturing industries\\n(measured by initial value added) was equal\\nto the total RCR for manufacturing as a whole.\\nAfter that there are other industries producing\\nanother 40 percent of the total, but their con-\\ntribution is offset by still other industries with\\nnegative RCR during the period.\\nCorresponding to the 25-percent figure for\\n1975, we have around 12 percent for 1975-\\n1980, 48 percent for 1980-1985, and 40 per-\\ncent for 1985-1991. These are the fractions of\\nmanufacturing industry which by themselves\\nwere able to account for the full amount of real\\ncost reduction during the respective period, in\\nmanufacturing industry as a whole.\\nThe second vertical line in each panel of\\nFigure 1 marks the maximum point of the\\ncurve. The interpretation is that about 64 per-\\ncent of industries enjoyed real cost reduction\\nduring 1970-1975, with the remaining 36 per-\\ncent suffering real cost increases (declining\\nTFP). For the subsequent periods, the corre-\\nsponding figures are 65(35) percent, 78(22)\\npercent, and 82 ( 18 ) percent. Here the first fig-\\nure is the percent of industries enjoying real\\ncost reductions; the figures in parentheses rep-\\nresent those experiencing declining TFP.\\nSome interest attaches to the ordinate of the\\nmaximum point on each curve.

In 1975-1980 this figure was about 240\\npercent, in 1980-1985 only about half that, and\\nin 1985-1991 a little more than 125 percent.\\nThe trouble is that when the aggregate TFP con-\\ntribution is relatively small, the cumulative total\\nof the positive contributions is a large multiple\\nof that aggregate, while when the aggregate is\\nlarge, this multiple tends to be smaller. Thus, for\\n1970-1975 and for 1975-1980, the total RCR\\nin manufacturing as a whole was only about 2.3\\npercent of initial manufacturing value added.

That same evening Yoram\\nBarzel suggested that where the aggregate\\nslope is negative, we apply the term \"sunset\\ndiagrams,\" which I immediately accepted.\\nFigure 3 presents a set of sunrise-sunset\\ndiagrams based on Jorgenson et al. (1987 pp.\\n188-90). These cover 32 industrial sectors\\n(their 35 minus Agriculture, Trade, and\\nGovernment Enterprises). I think the utility\\nof sunrise-sunset diagrams needs no further\\nchampioning once these pictures are exam-\\nined and digested. Practically all variants are\\nrepresented in these real-world cases: low\\nTFP growth with a huge overshoot (1953-\\n1957 and 1969-1973); negative growth\\nwith large and moderate overshoots (1966-\\n1969 and 1973-1979); moderate growth\\nwith small (1979-1985), medium (1960-\\n1966), and large (1948-1953) overshoots.\\nOne striking fact that emerges from this set\\nof pictures is how variable across periods is\\nthe negative contribution of the losers. If the\\nlosers had only contributed zero change in\\nTFP, we would have had cumulative TFP con-\\ntributions of about 0.8 percent per annum in\\n1948-1953, in 1957-1960, and in 1960-\\n1966. And the other periods would not have\\nbeen much different: about 0.7 percent in\\n1953-1957 and in 1969-1973, 0.6 percent in\\n1966-1969, and 0.5 percent in 1973-1979\\nand 1979-1985. Instead of this narrow range\\nof cumulative contributions, we have an actual\\ndistribution that goes from -0.9 percent in\\n1973- 1979 through around 0.1 percent in\\n1953-1957 and 1969-1973 to over 0.5\\npercent in 1960-1966 and 1979-1985.\\nDoes this not suggest that we make a major\\nresearch push trying to improve our under-\\nstanding of the phenomenon of negative TFP\\ngrowth? What syndromes characterize the firms\\nand industries experiencing it? How much of it\\nstems from external shocks like international\\nprices? How much of it from competition\\nwithin the industry? How much of it represents\\nfirms struggling to survive, yet experiencing\\noutput levels well below their previous peaks\\n(and presumably below installed capacity)?\\nHow much of it represents things like \"labor\\nhoarding\" as firms go through periods of\\nadversity?\\nIL.

The grand design\\nthat emerges from the studies reported here,\\nand from just about all the other industry\\nbreakdowns that I recall having seen, is that:\\n(i) a small-to-modest fraction of industries\\ncan account for 100 percent of aggregate real\\ncost reduction in a period; (ii) the comple-\\nmentary fraction of industries contains win-\\nners and losers, the TFP contributions of\\nwhich cancel each other; (iii) the losers are\\na very important part of the picture most of\\nthe time, and contribute greatly to the varia-\\ntions we observe in aggregate TFP perfor-\\nmance; and (iv) there is little evidence of\\npersistence from period to period of the lead-\\ners in TFP performance.\\nThe above results are, I think, very in-\\nteresting (in the sense of piquing our curi-\\nosity), very strong (in terms of their impli-\\ncations about the nature of the growth\\nprocess), and very robust (in the sense that\\nthey have wide applicability over different\\ndata sets analyzed by different authors using\\nat least somewhat different methods).

This vision in\\nturn leads one to think in different ways not\\nonly about the growth process itself but about\\nhow we, as economists, might best advance\\nour study and understanding of it, and how\\npolicies might be molded so as better to pro-\\nmote it.\\n(a) It is always wise to study the compo-\\nnents of growth separately. The rate of in-\\nvestment, the rate of return on capital, the rate\\nof growth of the labor force in numbers or in\\nhours worked, the contribution of human cap-\\nital or of the increment in average quality of\\nlabor, and the residual representing real cost\\nreduction-all these are sufficiently different,\\nand potentially sufficiently disjoint from each\\nother, to merit their being treated separately. I\\nwould give special emphasis to the following\\nthree points.\\n(i) The worthwhileness of measuring the\\nrate of return and emphasizing its role in\\nthe growth process.\\n(ii) The importance of focusing on invest-\\nment rather than saving in studying the\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Saving takes on great im-\\nportance in closed-economy models fo-\\ncused on aggregate growth, in which\\ncase it is equal to investment. It gets to\\nbe almost meaningless as one focuses on\\nthe growth of cities and regions, or on\\nfirms and industries.\\n(iii) The importance of viewing the residual\\nas an umbrella covering real cost reduc-\\ntions of all kinds, and of recognizing that\\nwe are closer to home thinking that RCR\\ntakes 1001 forms than that it can be well\\nrepresented by one or two or three\\naggregate-style variables.\\n(b) In principle, the accumulation of hu-\\nman capital by the laborforce should be rep-\\nresented in the labor contribution of the\\ngrowth equation, or in a bifurcation of this\\ncontribution into one due to raw labor, the\\nother to human capital. It is in a term like\\niwiALi that one captures the shifting skill\\ncomposition of the labor force. In particular,\\nwe capture here the higher wages that are the\\nfruits of investment in education and training,\\nwhich are the benefits that the workers them-\\nselves perceive. These should be kept sepa-\\nrate from any externalities education might\\nhave.\\nIt is important to try to keep this internalized\\npart of the story out of the residual, so that we\\ncan straightforwardly interpret the residual as\\nreal cost reduction.\\n(c) To study externalities due to education,\\ntraining, or human capital, we should not be\\ncontent with broad generalizations such as\\n\"TFP growth is higher in entities with lots of\\nhuman capital per worker.\" We should try to\\nfigure out how this externality works. Is it\\nhigher forfirms with high incidence of human\\ncapital? Is it higher for industries or sectors?\\nOr are human capital externalities more spatial\\nin nature, making more efficient the economic\\nlife of the cities, provinces, states, or nations\\nwhich have high concentrations of human cap-\\nital? And if this is a fruitful trail to pursue, at\\nwhat type and size of geographical units do\\nthese externalities typically work?\\n(d) The same goes for economies of scale.\\nWe should not be satisfied with vague attri-\\nbutions of economies of scale, say, at the level\\nof the national economy. Instead, we should\\npursue the matter. If the economies of scale\\nare national, through what channels do they\\nwork, and what evidence do we have to look\\nat to see them in operation? In particular, what\\nis their connection to real cost reductions\\nwhere they really happen-i.e., at the level of\\nthe firm? Economies of scale at the levels of\\nthe firm and the industiy are easier to visual-\\nize. Here, too, however, the task is to check\\nthem out-to see if the real cost reductions of\\nfirms are linked to the initial sizes of those\\nfirrns themselves, or of the industries in which\\nthey operate, and of the direction (up or down)\\nin which output is moving.\\n(e) Perhaps most important of all, we\\nshould really try to take full advantage of ev-\\nidence at the firm level. I think particularly of\\nidentifying considerable numbers of outstand-\\ning cases of TFP improvements and TFP de-\\ncline, and studying them one by one to try to\\nferret out the sources of their big real cost re-\\nductions and real cost increases. You can be\\npretty sure, if there have been big real cost\\nreductions in a firm, some people in that firm\\nhave a pretty good idea of where those reduc-\\ntions came from and how they were accom-\\nplished. By capturing this grassroots evidence,\\nwe can put some added discipline into our ru-\\nminations about the nature of TFP at the ag-\\ngregate level. We must follow up on the sort\\nof work pioneered by Jacob Schmookler\\n(1966) and Edwin Mansfield (1995). In gen-\\neral, our aggregate story should be compatible\\nwith, and comfortably contain, what we see at\\nthe grassroots level. In particular our overall\\npicture of TFP improvement should comfort-\\nably accept the overwhelming evidence of the\\n\"\\'mushroomss\" rather than \"yeast\" nature of\\nthe process.\\n(f ) Special urgency applies to the study of\\ndeclining total factor productivity at both the\\nfirm and the industry levels.

I find it hard to think of\\nmore fertile soil for future research on the pro-\\ncess of economic growth.\\n(g) I do not think that we gain much by\\ntrying to express the relation between policies\\nand economic growth by a series of regres-\\nsions. Cross-country growth regressions seem\\nhopelessly naive to longtime observers of the\\ngrowth process like myself. To us, there is too\\nmutch to question in regression lines that draw\\nmuch of their slope from the differences be-\\ntween Sudan and Switzerland, between Bang-\\nladesh and Brazil, or between Ceylon and\\nCanada. In contrast, it seems much more sen-\\nsible to look at episodes within individual\\ncountries and to search for common elements\\nthat characterize the passage from bad to good\\ngrowth experiences within each of the number\\nof countries, and for those elements that seem\\nto describe the good growth experiences on the\\none hand and the bad ones on the other. I think\\nwe can reach in this way a good appreciation\\nof the nature of the growth process, without\\nresorting to the straitjacket of regression lines\\nthat seem to draw from comparisons among\\nvery disparate countries, lessons that are sup-\\nposed to be meaningful for countries like\\nBangladesh, Ceylon, and the Sudan-as well\\nas others at different levels-as each strives\\nto take the next upward step in the climb to-\\nward modernization.\\nMy view of cross-country growth regres-\\nsions is somewhat less negative to the extent\\nthat they focus on the components of growth\\n(rate of investment, rate of return, and real\\ncost reduction in particular) rather than on the\\noverall growth rate. There is also a subtle dis-\\ntinction to be drawn between two ways of\\npresenting cross-country regressions- (i) as\\n\"explaining\" why and how some countries\\ngrow faster than others (not recommended),\\nand (ii) as simply summarizing a series of\\n\"stylized facts\" describing the experience we\\nobserve (far preferable, and not just for its be-\\ning more modest in its claims).\\nV. Some Policy Implications\\nIn approaching the question of the influence\\nof policy on real cost reduction in particular,\\nand, to a degree even on economic growth in\\ngeneral, I believe that the key words are \"ob-\\nstructing\" and \"enabling.\" We know from\\nsad experience how easy it is for governments\\nto adopt policies that get in the way of eco-\\nnomic growth and even turn it negative. We\\nknow, too, that there is no \"silver bullet,\" no\\nsingle magic key that by itself opens the door\\nto a paradise of prosperity and growth.\\nBroadly speaking, the easiest starting point for\\na successful growth experience is a once-\\nprosperous economy that has suffered from\\nbad policies. Releasing that economy from its\\ntrammels, correcting an accumulation of past\\nmistakes, can sometimes set in motion a pro-\\nlonged episode of astounding growth. A shift\\nfrom policies that obstruct to policies that en-\\nable growth seems to lie at the heart of growth\\n\"miracles\" like those of Taiwan, Spain, Ko-\\nrea, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China\\n(among others).\\nThe springboard for the following listing of\\npolicy implications is the interpretation of the\\ngrowth residual as representing real cost re-\\nduction and the ready acceptance that in the\\nreal world RCR comes in 1001 different\\nforms.\\n(a) The first key observation is that people\\nmust perceive real costs in order to reduce\\nthem. Hence, policies that impede the accurate\\nperception of real costs are ipso facto inimical\\nto growth. Inflation is the most obvious, prob-\\nably the most pervasive, and almost certainly\\nthe most noxious of such policies. If I have any\\nexpertise based on experience in economics, it\\nhas to be in the first-hand observation of pro-\\ncesses of serious inflation. So I ask you to\\ntake my word for it: the most serious cost of\\ninflation is not a triangle or a trapezoid under\\nthe demand curve for real cash balances, nor\\nis it the inflation tax. The most serious cost\\nof inflation is the blurring of economic\\nagents\\' perceptions of relative prices. This\\nhappens because individual prices adjust in\\ndifferent ways and at very different rates. A\\nhigh product price and a low input cost nor-\\nmally is an invitation clamoring for new in-\\nvestments to be made. This is not so during a\\nserious inflation, when such a signal can eas-\\nily turn out to be \"here today, gone next\\nmonth\" as both product and input prices con-\\ntinue on their separate paths of adjustment to\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'the ongoing inflation. Without exception, in\\nmy own observations, the higher the rate of\\ninflation, the worse is its effect in blurring\\nagents\\' perceptions of relative prices. In an\\ninflation at, say, 20 percent to 50 percent per\\nyear, people see prices as in a morning haze;\\nin one of 20 percent to 50 percent per month,\\nthey see them as in a London fog. Many em-\\npirical studies exist showing that serious in-\\nflations are seriously inimical to growth. (See\\nWilliam Easterly, 1996.) The clouding of\\nperceptions of relative prices is an important\\nreason why-for it gets in the way of suc-\\ncessful real cost reductions at the level of the\\nindividual firm.\\nInflation also inhibits growth in other, per-\\nhaps more obvious ways:\\n(i) by diverting energies from more produc-\\ntive activities to the search for mecha-\\nnisms of inflation protection;\\n(ii) by reducing (often very drastically) peo-\\nple\\'s real monetary balances, thus im-\\npacting negatively on the real amount of\\ncredit the banking system provides to the\\nproductive sector; and\\n(iii) somewhat related to both (a) and (b),\\nby causing people (both \"here\"\\' and\\nabroad) to invest abroad some of the\\nfunds they would otherwise have in-\\nvested \"here,\" or (what is very close\\nto the same thing) by accumulating\\nhoards of hard currencies as an inflation\\nhedge.\\n(b) A second policy implication is, in the\\nwords of my friend and longtime collabora-\\ntor Ernesto Fontaine, avoid \"prices that lie\"\\n(precios mentirosos). Talking about infla-\\ntion, we focus on the blurring of the signals\\nthat the price system gives; here we focus on\\nits giving wrong signals due to distortions\\nthat have been introduced, usually as a direct\\nconsequence of government policies. No\\ngood can or did come, in terms of economic\\nefficiency, from tariffs of 50 percent and 100\\npercent and more, giving effective protec-\\ntion often of 200 percent and 300 percent\\nand more. Nor can growth be fostered by\\nheavy-handed price controls and interven-\\ntions in credit markets.\\nI am not being a religious purist here-just\\nas big distortions have big costs, small distor-\\ntions typically have small costs, and all econ-\\nomies are distorted to some degree. The\\nmessage here is that economies have to pay\\nthe price for the level of distortions they\\nchoose to have, and that one of the important\\ncomponents of that price is that distortions\\ncreate situations where what is truly a saving\\nof private costs is not a genuine saving of costs\\nfrom the point of view of the economy as a\\nwhole.\\n(c) Just as bad, and often even worse than\\ndirect distortions, are the excess costs imposed\\non an economy by ill-conceived regulations\\nand bureaucratic hurdles. Hermando DeSoto\\n(1989) has made the exposure of these tram-\\nmels in Peru into what has become virtually\\nhis life\\'s work. Clear rules of the game are\\nan essential and integral part of a well-\\nfunctioning market economy, but all too easily\\nthese get supplemented by others that make\\ninvestment, production, marketing, sales, new\\nproduct development, etc., more costly. Labor\\nlaws have been particularly troublesome, often\\nadding artificially to the cost of labor and giv-\\ning firms a strong incentive to avoid hiring\\nnew workers, simply because of the high costs\\nassociated with any later dismissal of them.\\nBut there are loads of other items-the need\\nfor approvals, sometimes a dozen or more,\\nbefore undertaking some investment or some\\nnew venture; regulations that one way or an-\\nother impede new entry, so as to protect strong\\nvested interests ( small retailers being pro-\\ntected against supermarkets in many coun-\\ntries); and the complexity of tax codes and\\ntheir enforcement, which imposes large com-\\npliance costs on business firms and indi-\\nviduals. Somehow, countries interested in\\npromoting growth should find ways of paring\\ntheir regulatory frameworks down to those\\nrules and requirements that are really justifi-\\nable in terms of their costs and benefits to the\\neconomy and society at large.\\n(d) Although international trade distor-\\ntions (tariffs, quotas, licenses, prohibitions,\\netc.) might be subsumed under points (b) and\\n(c), their importance merits a separate head-\\ning. The move to openness (from a protec-\\ntionism that sometimes bordered on autarchy)\\nhas been one of the main hallmarks of the\\ngrowth miracles of the past half-century [see\\n\\n\\n###',\n",
       " 'conomics-1998-0-24.tx',\n",
       " 'Sebastian Edwards (1993) and Anne 0.\\nKrueger (1985, 1997)]. Just as inflation has\\ncosts beyond the area under the demand curve\\nfor real cash balances, so protectionism seems\\nto have burdens that go beyond the standard\\ntriangle-trapezoid-rectangle measures of the\\ncosts of trade distortions. There are at least two\\nquite natural explanations: first, that openness\\nhelps grease the wheels of the international\\ntransfer of more modern technologies, and\\nsecond, that firms that may once have relaxed\\nin ease and comfort behind high protective\\nbarriers end up having to sink or swim once\\nforced to compete in a much more open-\\neconomy setting. Under either explanation,\\ntrade liberalization opens up new paths of real\\ncost reduction, thus providing additional im-\\npetus to economic growth.\\n(e) The recent wave of privatizations\\namong both developed and developing econ-\\nomies may have important effects in enabling\\nreal cost reductions that otherwise might have\\nbeen delayed, or not have happened at all. It\\nis, I believe, fair to say that in most countries\\nstate-owned enterprises operate under a series\\nof constraints that seriously get in the way of\\nreal cost minimization in a comparative-static\\nsense and of real cost reduction in a dynamic\\nsense. These constraints sometimes limit the\\nsalaries of executives, sometimes impose\\nonerous conditions on the firm as it employs\\nlower-skilled workers, often limit the capacity\\nof the firm to shut down inefficient lines of\\nproduction, and almost always make it diffi-\\ncult to fire workers, etc. To my mind, however,\\nperhaps the worst attribute of state-owned en-\\nterprises is the ethos that often evolves inside\\nof them-an ethos where middle managers\\nare well advised to \"leave well enough\\nalone,\" \"not rock the boat,\" and \"not invite\\ntrouble.\" This ethos flies in the face of a vision\\nof the growth process that gives a huge role to\\nthe search for real cost reductions at the grass-\\nroots level, and that recognizes the tumult that\\naccompanies \"creative destruction\" in all its\\nforms. I thus must applaud the contemporary\\ntrend toward privatization. If I harbor any\\nqualms in this connection, they concern the\\ndegree to which many privatizations have been\\ncarried out in too much haste and with too little\\ncare, often motivated by purely fiscal consid-\\nerations rather than by a general search for\\neconomic efficiency. This nlay have led to gra-\\ntuitous transfers of wealth in some instances\\nand to the planting of newly private enterprises\\nin soil that was not properly prepared (e.g.,\\nstill lacking a sound regulatory framework for\\nelectricity rates, or intelligent rules promoting\\ncompetitiveness in at least some aspects of\\ntelecommunications, etc.)\\n(f) One cannot complete a list like this\\nwithout mentioning something that most of us\\nsimply take for granted-a sound legal and\\ninstitutional framework in which individuals\\nare protected against arbitrary incursions on\\ntheir property and other economic rights. This\\nvery basic point-recently much emphasized\\nby Douglass C. North ( 1990), Robert J.\\nBarrow and Xavier Sala-i-Martin (1994),\\nMancuir Olson, Jr. ( 1996), and Barro ( 1997 )\\nis at least potentially a vital element for a sus-\\ntained process of successful economic growth.\\nIf it is true that spurts of growth have some-\\ntimes occurred in the absence of such a frame-\\nwork, it is also true that most cases of\\nsustained growth over long periods of time\\nhave benefitted from a sound institutional and\\nlegal environment.\\n(g) Somewhat related to the above is the\\nelement of political consensus concerning the\\nbroad outlines of economic policy. We have\\nlearned from experience that very admirable\\npolicy reforms can take place, yet end up hav-\\ning little effect. This can happen because a\\nnew government comes in and reverses the re-\\nform. But it can also happen because people\\nfear that a new government will come in and\\nreverse the reforms later on.

Living in a world in which real\\ncost reductions are a key dynamic force pro-\\nducing economic growth, we must look to the\\nmotivations and preoccupations of those who\\ntake the critical decisions at the level of the\\nfirm. For these decisions, it is not only impor-\\ntant that the policy framework be good now;\\nthe expectation that it will stay good in the\\nfuture is also important. Otherwise, invest-\\nments will tend to be limited to those with\\nshort horizons and payment periods, and much\\nsoil, fertile with longer-term economic oppor-\\ntunities, will go unplowed.\\nVI. A Vision of the Growth Process\\nLet me now try to summarize my own vi-\\nsion of the growth process-the major ele-\\nments of which have been presented here. In\\nthe first place we have the five standard pillars\\nof growth-the rate of increase in the labor\\nforce, the rate of increase in the stock of hu-\\nman capital, the increase in the capital stock\\n(net investment as a fraction of value added),\\nthe rate of return which that investment will\\nyield (or can be expected to yield) and, last\\nbut not least, real cost reductions stemming\\nfrom 1001 different sources.\\nCommenting on these in turn, I would note\\nthat increases in the labor force have taken on\\nnew meaning in many countries as labor force\\nparticipation rates (particularly those of\\nwomen) have increased. Whereas with a con-\\nstant participation rate, the growth rate of the\\nlabor force is just a proxy for the growth rate\\nof population, important increases in labor\\nforce participation can lead, just by them-\\nselves, to significant increases in measured\\nreal income per head.\\nConcerning increases in the stock of human\\ncapital, my conviction is that most of their\\ncontribution to growth is, on the whole, well\\nmeasured by market wages, as in the expres-\\nsion XiwiALi. This does not deny the exis-\\ntence of externalities due to an increased\\nhuman capital stock; it simply judges their in-\\nfluence on the growth rate to be modest in\\ncomparison with the effects of education,\\ntraining, learning-by-doing, etc., that can be\\n(and typically are) internalized by those who\\nreceive them. We therefore look for the effects\\nof human capital accumulation mainly in the\\nterm YjwjALj, and only (via externalities) as\\none of many elements underlying the growth\\nresidual R'.\\nThe rate of investment is a veteran on the\\nstage of growth analysis. What I would em-\\nphasize here is the importance of maintaining\\na clear separation between the rate of invest-\\nment and the rate of saving. Models (like\\nthose of the representative consumer) in\\nwhich saving and investment are always\\nequal are not much use even for analysis at\\nthe national level in our modern, interde-\\npendent world. They are even less useful as\\none goes down to smaller geographical\\nregions, and simply cease to make sense as\\none studies the growth process at the levels\\nof the industry and the firm.\\nThe rate of return to investment has in\\nmany ways been the orphan of our growth\\nanalysis, having been masked from view by\\nour typical representation of capital's contri-\\nbution to the growth rate as Sk (AK/K). Here\\nthe rate of return (p + 6) is totally hidden\\nfrom view. I deeply urge that more of us get\\ninto the habit of representing this same term\\nas (p + 6)(AKIy). I want to see more atten-\\ntion paid to the rate of return because it plays\\nsuch a central role in the motivation of eco-\\nnomic agents, and also because changes in it\\nare such an important element in understand-\\ning and explaining the growth residual, R'.\\nTable 3 helps explain why I feel this way.\\nThis table is adapted from Harald Beyer's\\n(1996) work. He carried out an analysis of\\nthe growth experiences of 32 countries rang-\\ning from Sri Lanka to the United States on\\nthe income scale, and from Iceland to Austra-\\nlia on the geographic scale. In Table 3 we\\npresent results for his ten countries with the\\nhighest and for his ten countries with the low-\\nest GDP growth rates from 1971-1991. In the\\nsecond column the calculated average annual\\nrate of return is shown. In the third column\\nwe have capital's contribution to the growth\\nrate [z (p + 6) (AKly) ], and in the final col-\\numn the estimated average annual rate of TFP\\ngrowth, all over the same time period.\\nTable 3 shows an unequivocal tendency for\\nfast-growing countnes to be experiencing high\\nrates of return as well as high capital contri-\\nbutions and high rates of TFP improvement.\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

It should likewise\\nbe no surprise that the opposite syndrome\\nwith weak real cost reductions and low rates\\nof return producing fewer interesting invest-\\nment opportunities-should end up being as-\\nsociated with a low capital contribution and a\\nlow GDP growth rate.\\nFinally, we come to the residual R\\' itself.\\nTo me, the biggest message here is to recog-\\nnize the multiplicity of sources from which it\\ncan (and I believe does) come, and the addi-\\ntivity that nevertheless is its attribute. I think\\nthat the term real cost reduction very neatly\\ncaptures both these aspects in a way that ren-\\nders it preferable to terms like TFP improve-\\nment and technical advance-preferable not\\nin the sense of a mechanical definition (for\\nwhich all three are equally good), but in the\\nsense of better conveying the underlying na-\\nture of the process to one\\'s listeners or readers.\\nThe next step is to recognize that of the five\\nmain pillars, at least three (the rate of invest-\\nment, the rate of return, and real cost re-\\nduction) are key foci of decision-making\\nprocesses at the level of the firm. I cannot es-\\ncape the conclusion that the great bulk of the\\naction associated with the growth process\\ntakes place at the level of the firm. Hence, I\\nfeel we should focus much more study than\\nwe have in the past on what happens at this\\nlevel. And when we are not working at the firm\\nlevel, we should pay a lot of attention to what\\nhappens at lesser levels of disaggregation like\\nindustries and industrial branches.\\nKey insights flow from taking this kind of\\nfocus. Few economists are aware of the per-\\nvasiveness with which sunrise-sunset dia-\\ngrams are characterized by overshooting, or of\\nthe importance that firms or industries with\\nreal cost increases (i.e., reductions in TFP)\\nplay in determining the aggregate rates of real\\ncost reduction that we see in such diagrams.\\nHere we have only scratched the surface in\\ndigesting the evidence. But I find impressive\\nthe degree to which the data of Table 3 seem\\nto point to a growth syndrome in which high\\nrates of return, high rates of investment, high\\nrates of real cost reduction, and high rates of\\noutput growth all go together. I see in this re-\\nsult the likelihood that real cost reductions are\\nthe big driving force, generating high rates of\\nreturn and calling forth high rates of invest-\\nment and high output growth. This interpre-\\ntation is compatible with many exercises that\\nI have perforned over the years in which I\\nhave tried to contrast high-growth with low-\\ngrowth experiences. In such exercises, as in\\nTable 3, the difference in rates of real cost re-\\nduction has typically been a major \"source\"\\nof the difference in growth rates.\\nAlso impressive in the analysis of the\\nJorgenson data is the degree to which the vary-\\ning experiences of U.S. manufacturing in dif-\\nferent decades derives from different degrees\\nof bad experience (real cost increases) rather\\nthan different degrees of good experience (real\\ncost reduction). It is as if the creative part of\\nSchumpeter\\'s \"creative destruction\" was\\nmore steady (for these decades in U.S. man-\\nufacturing) than the destructive part, whetting\\nour (or at least my) appetite to look deeper,\\ninquiring into why this was so.\\nThe Mexican data at the firm level were\\nsomewhat more recalcitrant than the Jorgenson\\ndata by industrial branch, but they nonetheless\\ngive us a clear picture of lots of winners and\\nlots of losers, with the losers being strongly\\ncharacterized by falling real value added and/\\nor by falling real rates of return.4\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'The role of policy in this vision of the\\ngrowth process is an \"enabling\" one. By cre-\\nating the circumstances where firms can\\nquickly and accurately predict opportunities\\nfor real cost reduction and act on them, gov-\\nernments can guide the economy toward an\\nenhanced contribution of RCR to growth. By\\nrationalizing and/or eliminating barriers and\\ncontrols, they may also lead to an increased\\npace of investment and increased rates of re-\\nturn. In this view, the connection between\\ngood policy and growth is not mechanical, and\\nthus cannot easily be captured in regression-\\ntype analysis, but that does not stop it from\\nbeing of vital importance.\\nI want to give special weight to another role\\nof \"growth-enabling\" policy actions, which\\nhas to do with how policies, the effects of\\nwhich might typically be considered to be\\ncomparative static, can nonetheless turn out to\\ninfluence economic growth rates over ex-\\ntended periods of time.\\nThis story begins with a recognition that\\nmost developing countries have typically used\\nproduction techniques that were \"backward\"\\nin relation to those used by the advanced econ-\\nomies. One way to verify this is to imagine\\nintegrally replicating, say, a U.S. factory in In-\\ndia, and manning it there with Indian workers\\nequivalent in skill to their U.S. counterparts.\\nThe combination of lower construction costs\\nand much lower operating costs (mainly\\nwages) would permit this hypothetical new In-\\ndian firm to undercut the prices of both the\\nU.S. firm of which it was a copy and the typ-\\nical Indian firm currently active in the same\\nindustry. This says that the typical Indian firm\\nis operating on an \"inferior\" production func-\\ntion. If, as I believe, the difference in effi-\\nciency between U.S. and developing-country\\nfirms is typically large, there is much room for\\nquite rapid improvements in the developing\\ncountries as they learn how to \"adopt and\\nadapt\" already-known techniques from the\\nadvanced countries.\\nI would assume that the incentives for \"con-\\nvergence\" are always present, but that they\\nhave typically run into barriers and trammels\\nof many kinds in the poor countries of the\\nworld. Reducing the barrfers and loosening the\\ntrammels permits the more rapid convergence\\nto techniques that are closer to the frontier of\\nknowledge.\\nThe way I see the influence of policy in\\ngrowth, it is simply not true that implementing\\nenabling policies typically permits a quantum\\njump from the old to the truly modem. It is\\nmore accurate to describe it as speeding up\\nwhat will in any case be a very lengthy pro-\\ncess. Personally, I like the analogy to a hy-\\ndraulic system in which a large vessel with a\\nhigh water level and lots of water is connected\\nto a much smaller and narrower vessel with a\\nmuch lower level of water. Physical laws dic-\\ntate a tendency for the water levels to equalize\\nin the end. But this can take a very long time\\nif the tube connecting the two vessels is tiny,\\nor is clogged by extraneous matter.\\nThe policies that we consider good for\\ngrowth have the attribute, in this analogy, of\\nremoving the extraneous matter and/or enlarg-\\ning the connecting tube. But even with the best\\nmodernizing policies, the tube remains small\\nenough so that it takes many decades for a\\ncountry to pass from poor to middle income or\\nfrom middle income to rich. If somehow the\\nhydraulic connection could be made so large\\nas to bring about an almost instantaneous full\\nadjustment of the water level, then we would\\nsay that good policies mainly represent level\\nadjustments. But observing even the best of\\nreal-world growth experiences, I think we\\nhave to conclude that the adjustment is going\\nto be extended over a lengthy period in any\\nevent, thus causing the big observable result\\nof better policies to be a higher growth rate\\nover an extended period rather than a discrete\\njump to a totally different level.\\nThis way of looking at the world also leads\\nto some observations on the current literature\\ndealing with convergence. I have long been\\nmystified by allusions to an ultimate conver-\\ngence of growth rates among countries, or an\\nultimate convergence of levels of output per\\nhead.

Those products will have no real\\ncost reductions or TFP improvements in the\\nfuture, while others will enjoy huge advances\\nof productivity. My guess is that unlucky\\ncountries (Bhutan, Nepal, Mongolia?) may\\nalways lag way behind the pack, while luckier\\nones (Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil?) may one\\nday hope to be among the world\\'s leaders. So\\nconvergence comes through as a general ten-\\ndency, and quite surely a general possibility,\\nfor the production techniques used in making\\nany given product to improve as enterprises\\nusing \"backward\" techniques learn of better\\nones, and even more important, learn about\\nhow to put them into practice. I do not believe\\nthat much more than this can be said of con-\\nvergence as a real-world force. Wage rates for\\ngiven types of labor tend toward a rough\\nequality across regions in a country because\\nof the ease of migration in response to per-\\nceived wage differences. The forces at work\\ninternationally are both weaker and more\\ncomplex, but the big message here is that\\nthe improvement of technique in any one in-\\ndustry does nothing to improve the wages of\\nlabor in just that industry. After an improve-\\nment, the industry may end up hiring more or\\nless labor, but will presumably choose the\\namount of labor so as to bring marginal pro-\\nductivity into correspondence with market\\nwages. So technological improvement has an\\neffect on wages via supply and demand in the\\nnational labor market, not through any direct\\nlink from technical improvement to wages\\n(for given skills, etc.) at the level of the in-\\ndustry or the firm.\\nAs my final point, let me return to the\\nthought that the justification for perfecting the\\nfunctioning of the market system does not lie\\nonly in reducing the efficiency costs associated\\nwith each period\\'s operation of the economy.\\nPerfecting a country\\'s economic policy does\\nnot only cause it to move from a path at\\naround, say, 90 percent of its potential output\\nto another equal to 95 percent of potential,\\nwith the time path of potential output being\\nsomehow given in advance.

These lessons-\\nbasically focused on thinking about policies in\\nterms of their economic costs and benefits-\\ncould easily be read as a reprise of the old\\ncomparative-static story. But they were not\\nmeanit as such-it is quite relevant that they\\nappeared in an essay concerned with world eco-\\nnomic growth.

The most ef-\\nficient way to do this is to measure both output\\n(value added) and the capital stock in units of\\nthe GDP deflator. That way one is sure that the\\noutputs of all the subaggregates in the econ-\\nomy add up to the GDP, and one also satisfies\\nthe requirement that the capital and return be\\nmeasured in the same units. This is also the\\nway cash flows would be deflated in a stan-\\ndard, ex post project evaluation. When this is\\ndone at the aggregate level the contribution of\\ncapital to growth is (p + 5) AK where p is an\\naggregate rate of return to capital, 6 the depre-\\nciation rate (including obsolescence), and AK\\nthe net increment to the capital stock in the\\nperiod in question. At a subaggregate level, the\\ncontribution of capital to growth in activity j\\nis (pj + bj) AKj. At both levels, we find that\\nhigh rates of return are an important compo-\\nnent of most successful growth episodes.\\n(b) To capture the great diversity of the la-\\nbor factor, we would like to have a very fine\\nbreakdown of labor into categories (indexed\\nby i). The labor contribution is then liwiALi,\\nwhere wi represents the real wage of category\\ni and ALi the change in hours worked by cat-\\negory i. Since the number of relevant catego-\\nries of labor is huge, any such breakdown is\\ndifficult, and gets more difficult as one disag-\\ngregates from economy to sector to branch to\\nindustry and to firm. This Gordian knot can be\\ncut by a simple assumption, similar to what is\\ndone in most countries to convert residential\\nconstruction to real terms. There, one builds a\\nprice index of a \"standard house\" p*, and\\nthen obtains a quantum of construction C* by\\ndividing total construction outlays by the price\\nof the standard house. In the resulting aggre-\\ngate, each individual residence (i) gets attrib-\\nuted a quantum of housing equal to Pi Ip */ In\\nthis work I define a standard wage w*, which\\nI assign to \"standard labor\" or \"raw labor.\"\\nThe excess of anybody\\'s actual wage over w *\\nis attributed to human capital. The returns to\\nnatural ability, as well as to formal education,\\ntraining, and experience belong there, under\\nthis interpretation. High returns due to a dis-\\ntorted wage structure are not appropriately\\nattributable to human capital, but the meth-\\nodology would nonetheless be correct in at-\\ntributing to the affected labor a marginal\\nproductivity that is measured by the distorted\\nhigh wage.\\nThe \"labor contribution\" as measured by\\nw*AL* is equal to w* (Q S(wi /w *) AL1 +\\niLi A(w /w*). The second term will be zero\\nif the structure of relative wages remains con-\\nstant, or even if the weighted average premium\\ndoes not change. Any changes in the weighted\\naverage premium will cause the calculated re-\\nsidual to be different from those calculated by\\nother methods.\\nThe \"two-deflator method\" is characterized\\nby the use of a single numeraire-deflator (say,\\nthe GDP deflator), by the treatment of the\\nquantum of output as value added divided by\\nthe numeraire-deflator, and by the use of a\\nstandard wage w * and a quantum of labor L *\\nequal to the wages bill divided by w *. This is\\nthe method used by Beyer (1996), Robles\\n(1997), and Torre (1997) in their work re-\\nported in this paper.\\nIt goes without saying that the two-deflator\\nmethod is rough. But it is also tremendously\\nrobust and easily applied. I think of it as being\\nreally designed for use at the firm level, where\\nvery commonly we can get data in value\\nadded, on gross investment, and on the wages\\nbill, but know nothing (from standard sources)\\nabout the quantum of output or about the num-\\nber of total hours worked (or even the total\\nnumber of employees used).

First, at\\nthe aggregate economy level, the two-deflator\\napproach comes very close to the traditional\\napproach. In rate-of-growth terms, we have\\n(R */y) = gy S- skgk * SL gL *, compared with\\n(Rly) =g - Skgk -SLgN, where g refers to\\ngrowth rate, and y to GDP. K* differs from K\\nin being built up from gross investment de-\\nflated by the GDP deflator, while K is built up\\nfrom gross investment deflated by the invest-\\nment deflator of GDP. L * is in principle much\\nmore refined than N (number of workers), but\\nits measurement can be influenced by a wid-\\nening or narrowing skill premium. (R */y)\\nlikewise differs from Jorgenson's residual\\n(R'/y) = gy - Yjskjgkj - 1ise gf mainly in his\\nuse of different capital deflators for different\\ncategories of capital. (The implicit labor\\nbreakdown in L * is much finer even than\\nJorgenson's, but Jorgenson does not have to\\ncontend with the possibilities of widening or\\nnarrowing skill premiums -at least not\\namong the labor categories he works with,\\nwhich are typically broken down by gender,\\nage, education, occupation, industry, and em-\\nploymnent status.)\\nThe bottom line is that when Beyer com-\\npares his two-deflator results, at the national\\naggregate level, with those of others using dif-\\nferent methods, he finds on the whole only\\nmodest differences. [See Beyer (1996);\\nHarberger (1998).]\\nWhen one uses the two-deflator method at\\nthe industry level, one often has the possibility\\nto adjust the quantity variable so as to make it\\ncorrespond with that of the more traditional\\napproach. Thus, we may start by using dy)e (=\\npjdyj + yjdpj) as the quantity variable, and cal-\\nculate a residual Rj* using that concept. Then\\nwe may get an adjusted residual by taking\\nR yjdpj. This is easy to do so long as we\\nhave decent data on dpj, the relative price of\\nj, which we often do at the branch or industry\\nlevel. When Jorgenson's residuals are com-\\npared with the two-deflator residuals, with and\\nwithout price adjustment, I find the differences\\nwithout adjustment to be small enough to be\\nquite acceptable. With adjustment, the degree\\nof agreement between the two approaches is\\nquite notable (85 percent of differences less\\nthan one percentage point of per annium\\ngrowth). [See Robles ( 1997); Ilarberger\\n(1998).]\\nWhen one gets down to the firm level, the\\ntwo-deflator method is in its element. Rarely\\ndo we have decent time series on the price in-\\ndex of a firm' s output. Treating many firrns in\\none industry, one might then give all of them\\nthe same price index-that of the industry. At\\nthat point the distribution of adjusted TFP re-\\nsiduals among the firms would end up differ-\\ning from the original two-deflator distribution\\nonly by a constant. When expressed in percent-\\nage terms we vould have (R)' ly)) = g4i -\\n*kj j ge*, for each fim j without adjust-\\nment, while with adjustment we would have\\nR]*Iy1 = the same expression minus go, the\\nrate of growth of the industry's relative ptice\\nindex (the same for all firms).\\nSo in the great bulk of cases one ends up\\nwith something quite like the two-deflator\\nmethod when working at the individual firm\\nlevel. The consolation is that the residual\\nterms of individual firms, calculated for the\\nwhole economy, add up to a residual term\\nfor the aggregate-in the sense that outputs\\nsum to GDP, the L]* sum to L * for the econ-\\nomy, the Kj* to K* for the economy, etc. For\\nmore details on methodology, see Harberger\\n(1998).\\n\\n###\",\n",

Today the av-\\nerage American male in his early thirties is\\nabout 177 cm (70 inches) tall and weighs\\nabout 78 kg (172 pounds). Such a male re-\\nquires daily about 1,800 kcal for basal metab-\\nolism and a total of 2,300 kcal for baseline\\nmaintenance. If either the British or the French\\nhad been that large during the eighteenth cen-\\ntury, virtually all of the energy produced by\\ntheir food supplies would have been required\\nfor personal maintenance, with little available\\nto sustain work. To have the energy necessary\\nto produce the national products of these two\\ncountries circa, 1700, the typical adult male\\nmust have been quite short and very light\\n(Fogel, 1997).\\nRecent studies have established the predic\\ntive power of height and weight at early ages\\nwith respect to onset of chronic diseases and\\npremature mortality at middle and late ages.\\nVariations in height and weight appear to be\\nassociated with variations in the chemical\\ncomposition of the tissues that make uip vital\\norgans, in the quality of the electrical trans-\\nmission across membranes, and in the func-\\ntioning of the endocrine system and other vital\\nsystems. Nutnitional status thus appears to be\\na critical link connecting improvements in\\ntechnology to improvements in human physi-\\nology (Fogel and Costa, 1997).\\nSo far I have focused on the contribution of\\ntechnological change to physiol-ogical im-\\nprovements. The process has been synergistic,\\nhowever, with improvement in. nutrition and\\nphysiology contributi-ng significantly to eco-\\nnomic growth and technological progress in a\\nmanner described elsewhere (Fogel., 2000).\\nHere I merely want to point out the main con-\\nclusion. Technophysio evolution appears to\\naccount for about half of British economic\\ngrowth over the past two centuries. Much of\\nthis gain was due to the improvement in hu-\\nman thermodynamic efficiency. The rate of\\nconverting human energy input into work out-\\nput appears to have increased by about 50 per-\\ncent since 1790 (cf., Partha Dasgupta, 1993).\\nTechnophysio evolution calls into question\\na number of easy and frequent assu-mptions in\\neconomic analyses such as: tastes are fixed;\\nneeds are fixed or exogenously determined;\\nexisting life tables are adequate to forecast fu-\\nture pension costs in. 2030 or 2075; and the\\nrate of aging is genetically controlled and un-\\nchanging from one generation to another.\\nTechnophysio evolution also calls into\\nquestion such frequently used theoretical as-\\nsumptions as fixed utility functions, fixed rates\\nof time preference over the life cycle, and the\\nrelated assumption that, except for risk differ-\\nentials, economic phenoomena should gener-\\nally be subject to the same rate of discount.\\nYet the rate of discount varies over the life\\ncycle; children, after all, have much higher\\ntime preferences than adults. It may also vary\\nby religion. Some individuals are prepared to\\nwait for their reward in heaven while others\\nwant it here and now. Moreover, these differ-\\nences may be evolving and multiplying more\\nrapidly than is now presunmed, as is indicated\\nby the debates over the impact of greenhoiuse\\ngases. Rethinking of the issue is now under-\\nway (see William D. Nordhaus, 1997; cf.,\\nPeter Koslowski, 1992; Nazli Choucri, 1.993;\\nMarc Fleurbaey and Philippe Michel, 1994;\\nMichael Toman, 1994) but the profession can\\nbenefit from an increased allocation of re-\\nsources to this problem.\\nTechnophysio evolution requires not just\\nmarginal adjustments, but majtor leaps in eco-\\nnomic theory. We are slow in pondering such\\ngrand questions as the inmplications of the Hu-\\nman Genome Project, which is now nearing\\ncompletion, and the emergence of molecular\\nmedicine for the future of economic life. We\\nhave entered an era in which p-urposeful inter-\\nvention in evolutionary processes is passing\\nbeyond plant and animal breeding. The new\\ngrowth economics needs to incorporate at least\\nsome aspects of directed, rapid human evolu-\\ntion. Endogenous technological change needs\\nto extend to the fundamentals of human be-\\nhavior. Theorists also need to grapple with the\\nethical implications of technological changes\\nthat, whatever their positive aspects, threaten\\nto undermine the mystery of human life by\\ntransforming people into \"material\" that is\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

The Growth of the Nonmarket Sector\\'\\nOne aspect of technophysio evolution has\\nbeen a change in the structure of consumption\\nand in the division of discretionary time be-\\ntween work and leisure. Perhaps the best index\\nof the growth of the nonmarket sector is the\\nchange in the use of time. Changes in hours of\\nwork and in the average division of the day\\nhave paralleled the changes in the structure of\\nconsumption. Table 2 shows the remarkable\\nreduction in the workyear that has occurred for\\nmales in the U.S. labor force over the past cen-\\ntury. Sleep, meals, and essential hygienie,\\nwhich are biologically determined, required\\nabout 10 hours of the day in 1880, as they do\\ntoday. The remaining 14 hours represent \"dis-\\ncretionary\" time.\\nThe most notable feature of Table 2 is the\\nlarge increase in leisure available to the typical\\nmale worker. His leisure time has tripled over\\nthe past century, as his workyear declined\\nfrom about 3,100 hours to about 1,730 hours\\ntoday. Table 2 also forecasts the division of\\nthe average day in 2040, indicating that by that\\ndate more than half of the discretionary day\\nwill be devoted to leisure activities. The fore-\\ncast is for a reduction of the workyear from\\nthe current average of about 1,730 hours to just\\n1,400 hours, with the average workweek down\\nto 30 hours.\\nThe pattern of chainge anmong women was\\nsimilar to that among men (cf., Claudia\\nGoldin, 1990; Stanley Lebergott, 1993). Th\\'e\\nworkday of wotnen in 1.880 was somnewhat\\nlonger, and in some respects may have bexen\\nmore arduous, than that of men. In households\\nof working farmners, artisans, and manual la-\\nborers, wives rose before their husbainds and\\ncontinued working until bedtimle at 10 or I1\\nP.M. That routine suggests a workday that\\nmay have run about 15 niinutes longer than\\nthat of males, implying an annual workyear of\\nperhaps 3,200 hours.\\nAs a result of the mechanization of the\\nhousehold, smaller families per household,\\nand the marketing of prepared foods, the typ-\\nical nofiemployed mnarried woman today\\nspends about 3.4 hours per day engaged in\\nhousework; and if she is enmployed the figure\\nfor housework drops to 2.2 hours. However,\\nwomen in the labor force average about 4.4\\nhours per day as emnployees. Hence comlbining\\n\"4work\" with \" chores,\" men and women\\nwork roughly equal amounts per day, and both\\nenjoy much miore leisure than they used to.\\nThe principal difference is that the gains of\\nwomen have comrie exclusively from the re-\\nduction in hours of housework, while the gains\\nof men have come from the reduction in the\\nhours of employed work (cf., John P.\\nRobinson and Geoffrey Godbey, 1997).\\nI have so far retained the common distinc-\\ntion between work and leisure, although these\\nterms are already inaccurate and may soon be\\nobsolete. The distinction was invented when\\nmost people were eingaged in manual labor for\\n60 or 70 hours per week and was intended to\\nconitrast with the highly regarded activities of\\nthe English gentry or their American equiva-\\nlent, Thorsten Veblen\\'s (l1899) \"leisure\\nclass.\" However, it should not be assumed\\nthat members of the leisure class were indo-\\nlent. In their youth they were students and ath-\\nletes. In young adult years they were warriors.\\nIn middle and later ages they were judges,\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Whatever they did was for the pleasure it\\ngave them since they were so rich that earning\\nmoney was not their concern.\\nHence, leisure is not a synonym for indo-\\nlence, but a reference to desirable forms of ef-\\nfort or work. As George Bernard Shaw (1928)\\nput it, \"labor is doing what we must; leisure\\nis doing what we like; and rest is doing nothing\\nwhilst our bodies and our minds are recovering\\nfrom their fatigue.\" In order to avoid confu-\\nsion, in the balance of this address I reserve\\nthe word \"work\" for use in its physiological\\nsense, an activity that requires energy, over\\nand above the basal metabolic rate (BMR).\\nActivity aimed primarily at earning a living I\\nwill call \" earnwork. \" Purely voluntary activ-\\nity, even if it incidentally carries some pay-\\nment with it, I will call \"volwork \"\\nWhy have hours of earnwork declined so\\nmuch in recent years? The answer to that ques-\\ntion is suggested by the fact that it is not just\\ndaily and weekly hours of earnwork that have\\ndeclined. The share of lifetime discretionary\\nhours spent in earnwork has declined even\\nmore rapidly. Table 2 only dealt with the hours\\nof earnwork of persons in the labor force. It\\ndid not reflect the fact that the average age of\\nentering the labor force is about five years later\\ntoday than it was in 1880, or that the average\\nperiod of retirement for those who live to age\\n50 is about 11 years longer today than it was\\nin 1880 (cf., Lee, 1996). A century ago only\\none out of five males aged 65 and older were\\nretired. Today, six out of seven are retired.\\nAll in all the lifetime discretionary hours\\nspent earning a living have declined by about\\none-third over the past century (see Table 3)\\ndespite the large increase in the total of life-\\ntime discretionary time. In 1880, four-fifths of\\ndiscretionary time was spent eamning a living.\\nToday, the lion\\'s share (59 percent) is spent\\ndoing what we like. Moreover, it appears prob-\\nable that by 2040 over three-quarters of dis-\\ncretionary time will be spent doing what we\\nlike, despite a fuLrther substantial increase in\\ndiscretionary time due to the continuing exten-\\nsion of the life span (cf., Jesse H. Ausubel and\\nA. Griibler, 1995).\\nWhy this deep desire for volwork? Why do\\nso many people want to forgo earnwork which\\nwould allow them to buy more food, clothing,\\nhousing, and other goods\\'? The answer tumrs\\npartly on the extraordinary technological\\nchange of the past century, which has not only\\ngreatly reduced the nunmber of hours of labor\\nthe average individual needs to obtain his or\\nher -food supply, but has also made housing,\\nclothing, and a vast array of consurner dura-\\nbles so cheap in real terms that the totality of\\nmaterial consumption requires miuch fewer\\nhours of labor today than was required over a\\nlifetine for food alone in 1880.\\nIndeed, we have become so rich that we are\\napproaching saturation\\' in the consumption\\nnot only of necessities, but of goods recently\\nthought to be luxuries, or which were only\\ndreams or science fiction during the first third\\nof the twentieth century. T\\'oday there is an av-\\nerage of two cars per household in the United\\nStates. Nearly every household with a person\\ncompetent to drive a car has one. On some\\nitems such as radios, we seem to have reachied\\nsupersaturation, since there is now more than\\none radio per ear (5.6 per household). The\\npoint is not merely that we are reaching satu-\\nration in commodities that once defined a high\\nstandard of living aiid quality of life but also\\nthat the hours of labor required to obtain those\\ncomnmodities have drastically declined. The\\ntypical household in 1875 required 1,800\\nhours of labor in the marketplace to acquire\\nthe annual food supply, but today it takes jus.t\\n260 hours. All in all, the comfrmodities that\\nused to account for over 80 percent of house-\\nhold consumption can now be obtained in\\ngreater abundance than previously, with less\\n\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Leisure, on the other hand,\\nhas risen from 18 percent of consumption to\\n67 percent.6 As Table 4 shows, the long-term\\nincome elasticities of the demand for food and\\nclothing are below 0.5 and the elasticity of the\\ndemand for shelter is closer to, but still below,\\n1.0. On the other hand, the long-term income\\nelasticities for leisure, education, and for med-\\nical services are over 1.O.7\\nTable 4 differs from current official tabula-\\ntions of household consumption in two prin-\\ncipal respects.

Table 4, however,\\nadds expenditures for education and health\\ncare consumed by households but paid by gov-\\nernment, employers, and other third parties.\\nMy procedure does little to change the distri-\\nbution of consumption in 1875 but signifi-\\ncantly increases the education and health-care\\nshares of consumption in 1995.8\\nTable 4 also differs from official tabulations\\nby adding to the value of out-of-pocket expen-\\nditures on leisure, the value of the time de-\\nvoted to leisure (volwork). That time is priced\\nat the average hourly rate of compensation of\\nlabor. The procedure increases the share of lei-\\nsure in consumption in both 1875 and 1995.\\nWhile leisure (volwork) remains a relatively\\nsmall share of expanded consumption in 1875,\\n\\nit accounts for two-thirds of expanded con-\\nsumption in 1995.'\\nThe failure to include the value of volwork\\nin the national income and product accounts is\\nperhaps the most glaring example of the cul-\\ntural lag to which I referred at the beginning\\nof this address. That omission also leads to a\\nsignificant underestimate of the long-term\\ngrowth rate of per capita income. Before ad-\\njustments for the increased quality of volwork,\\nthe growth rate is increased by eight-tenths of\\na point (from 1.8 to 2.6 percent per annum).\\nBut adjustments for improvements in the qual-\\nity of volwork might substantially increase\\nthat figure, since leisure-time activities in 1875\\nwere limited largely to church on Sundays and\\ncarousing in bars during the rest of the week\\n(cf., Fogel, 2000).

But whatever their\\nusefulness for other problems, cross-sectional\\ndata are often highly misleading guides to\\ntrends on such critical economic issues of the\\nnew millennium as the prevalence rates of\\nchronic disabilities, expenditures on health\\ncare, and pension costs.\\nResearch initiated during the past decade\\nand a half has called into question previous\\nviews on the length and fixity of the life span,\\non the shape of the Gompertz curve (which\\nrelates the log of the age-specific probability\\nof dying to age), on the theory of the epide-\\nmiological transition, 10 and on the related\\nproposition that longer life expectancy implies\\nworse health among the survivors. It appears\\nthat some of the earlier propositions were the\\nconsequence of attempts to infer life-cycle be-\\nhavior from cross-sectional data sets. Such ef-\\nforts were thwarted by changes in the\\nsampling design of successive cross sections\\nand by changes in technology that led to earlier\\ndiagnosis of preexisting conditions (Timothy\\nWaidmann et al., 1995).\\nThe new research also accumulated evi-\\ndence on the outward movement of the sur-\\nvivorship curve. Vaino Kannisto ( 1994) (cf.,\\nKannisto, 1996) has shown that, in 14 coun-\\ntries for which the data are adequate, mortality\\nover age 80 has been declining by about 1 per-\\ncent per annum for about half a century with\\na significant acceleration in recent decades.\\nJohn R. Wilmoth (1995, 1997), who exam-\\nined extreme longevity in five countries,\\nconcluded that the right-hand end of the sur-\\nvivorship curve has been shifting outward for\\ntwo centuries. Moreover, there is additional\\nevidence that the Gompertz curve either levels\\noff or declines at old old ages (James W.\\nVaupel, 1997; cf., S. Jay Olshansky and Bruce\\nA. Cames, 1997).\\nAnother development is the continued ac-\\ncumulation of evidence linking events early in\\nlife, and reflected in height, weight, and body\\nmass index (BMI), to the onset of chronic con-  ditions. \" A number of longitudinal studies that\\nwere launched in the 1950\\'s and 1960\\'s have\\nrecently been extended to cover the entire pe-\\nriod of human growth and early adulthood,\\nthrough follow-up studies. These have con-\\nfirined the persistence of central nervous sys-\\ntemr defects induced by malnutrition in early\\nchildhood (Nevin S. Scrimshaw, 1995). Nu-\\nmerous other follow-up studies have shown\\nthat malnutrition and smoking in adolescence\\nand in middle ages are risk factors for the early\\nonset of chronic conditions and premature\\nmortality, especially due to coronary heart dis-\\nease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and re-\\nspiratory diseases (Avita Must et al., 1992;\\nVincent J. Carey et al., 1997; N. K. Chin et\\nal., 1997; Joan M. Dom et al., 1997; K. Kotani\\net al., 1997; Dan S. Sharp et al., 1997; Ralf\\nBender et al., 1998). These relationships have\\nbeen established in American, Asian, Austra-\\nlian, European, and Latin American popula-\\ntions-rich and poor. Economists have also\\ndiscovered a close link between later produc-\\ntivity and height, BMI, and protein consump-\\ntion (after controlling for caloric intake)\\n(John Strauss and Duncan Thomas, 1995;\\nThomas and Strauss, 1997).\\nThere has also been an expansion of re-\\nsearch into the connection between intrauter-\\nine and infant growth and the onset of chronic\\ndiseases (or premature mortality). The strong-\\nest evidence for such a link that has emerged\\nthus far is with respect to hypertension, coro-\\nnary heart disease (CHD), and non-insulin-\\ndependent diabetes. A review of 32 papers\\ndealing with the relationship between birth\\nweight and hypertension by Catherine M. Law\\nand Alistair W. Shiell (1996) showed a ten-\\ndency for middle-aged blood pressure to in-\\ncrease as birth weight declined. Evidence of a\\nconnection between birth size and later coro-\\nnary heart disease has been found in England,\\nWales, Sweden, India, and Finland.12\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Rose, 1991; Caleb E. Finch,\\n1997; Hillard Kaplan, 1997). The term \"plas-\\nticity\" refers to the widely varying pattern of\\naging within species and the ability of the\\nlength of the life span to be affected by envi-\\nronmental factors, some of which may operate\\nover several generations (cf., Kenneth W.\\nWachter and Finch, 1997).\\nThe search for better ways to forecast long-\\nterm trends in health-care costs and in pension\\ncosts has made it essential for economists to\\nunderstand the underlying physiological, nu-\\ntritional, and epidemiological factors that af-\\nfect the changing demand for health care and\\nretirement. Forecasts about health-care costs\\nare obviously related to assumptions about\\nchanges in both life expectancy and age-\\nspecific morbidity rates. If current morbidity\\nrates at older ages are presumed to remain con-\\nstant or to increase over the next 30 to 50\\nyears, and if life expectancy is also presumed\\nto increase, then national health-care costs be-\\ncome astronomic. However, if one takes ac-\\ncount of the recent declines in age-specific\\ndisability rates, then the share of health-care\\ncosts in GDP might remain constant (Kenneth\\nG. Manton et al., 1997b; Manton et al., 1998),\\nprovided the demand for health services\\n(given disability rates) does not increase. If,\\nhowever, the income elasticity of the demand\\nfor health is greater than one, then as income\\nincreases, the share of income that is spent on\\nhealth care could increase even if disability\\nrates decline (see Fogel, 1997). It is quite pos-\\nsible for the demand for medical interventions\\nto increase, even though age-specific morbid-\\nity rates decline, for one or more of the fol-\\nlowing reasons: shifts in the age structure of\\nthe population toward ages with high morbid-\\nity rates; improvements in inedical interven-\\ntions for a wide range of chronic conditions\\nwhich alleviate symptoms but do not cure; the\\nreplacement of current disease-specific standards\\nof care by new ones based on improved tech-\\nnologies that are much more expensive than\\nthose replaced; the elimination of current age re-\\nstrictions on such expensive procedures as organ\\nreplacements (cf., David M. Cutler and Ellen\\nMeara, 1998; Alan M. Garber et al., 1998).\\nThe complexity of the underlying issues in\\nthe economics and biodemography of aging\\nhas led to a significant shift away from cross-\\nsectional data sets and to a concentration on\\nlongitudinal data sets. The earliest of the major\\nlongitudinal studies sponsored by the National\\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), the Framingham\\nHeart Study, began in 1950 and was focused\\non the causes and treatment of coronary heart\\ndisease rather than on the economics and bio-\\ndemography of aging. The Retirement History\\nSurvey (RHS) followed a cohort of men and\\nwomen aged 58 to 63 from 1969 to 1979 and\\nthen was suspended. Although not initially\\nplanned as a longitudinal study, it became the\\nmainstay of retirement research during the\\n1980\\'s. Linked to the social security file on\\ncovered earnings, it provided important in-\\nsights into the labor-force and retirement be-\\nhavior of older workers.\\nIn 1990, the National Institute of Aging\\nlaunched a new Health and Retirement Survey\\n(HRS) focused on the cohort born between\\n1931 and 1941, and aimed at collecting a much\\nwider set of variables than covered by the\\nolder RHS. The new HRS collected numerous\\nmeasures of health (including cognitive abil-\\nity), taxable earnings, job characteristics,\\nhours of work, job turnover, family character-\\nistics, pensions, health insurance, and owner-\\nship of an array of assets including real estate,\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Al-\\nthough the questions in AHEAD overlap with\\nHRS, functional ability is investigated inten-\\nsively and labor-market activity is covered\\nlightly.\\nBoth HRS and AHEAD have made it pos-\\nsible to examne a wide range of issues with\\nmore reliable and more detailed evidence than\\npreviously available. James P. Smith and\\nRaynard Kington (1997), for example, have\\nused AHEAD to examine disparities in func-\\ntional status and to relate them to socio-\\neconomic status (SES variables). They\\ndiscovered strong feedback effects not only\\nfrom health to SES variables but from SES\\nvariables to health. To disentangle these ef-\\nfects they broke household income and wealth\\ninto various categories made possible by the\\ndata and examined the effects by age. They\\nwere also able to make use of a range of vari-\\nables bearing on the health and socioeconomnic\\nstatus of relatives in three generations (par-\\nents, siblings, and children). Their analysis in-\\ndicated that cuffent-period health and income\\nare attributes of past, concurent, and future\\ngenerations. Measuring the full extent of these\\ninfluences, the direction of causation, and\\ncomplex interactions requires the study of life-\\ncycle histories from birth to very old age. It\\nwould be inappropriate, they concluded, to use\\nSES variables to explain variations in late-age\\nhealth without taking account of the feedback\\nmechanisms or identifying within-period in-\\nnovations in the stock of health (cf. John\\nBound et al., 1998).\\nSuch findings point to the usefulness of cre-\\nating a prospective life-cycle sanple for an ex-\\ntinct cohort (the veteratns of the Union Army)  by utilizing military, pension, and census records\\nin archives. This procedure not only creates a\\nlongitudinal data base in a small fraction of the\\ntime required to trace a living cohor, but cm be\\ndone at less than a tenth of the normnal cost.

Thus, veterans raised in\\na county with high mortality rates were, half a\\ncentury later, at elevated risks of suffering\\nfrom disabling respiratory disease, circulatory\\ndisease, and musculoskeletal problems (cf.,\\nLee, 1997).

Moreover, a comparison of\\nrates of decline in disabilities before and after\\n1980 indicates that disabilities are declining at\\nan accelerating rate (cf., Manton et al., 1997a;\\nCutler and Elizabeth Richardson, 1998).\\nThe mounting evidence of substantial inter-\\nactions over the life cycle that influence the\\nprocess of aging, the acceleration of techno-\\nlogical change which has profoundly affected\\nthe context in which aging occurs, and the in-\\ncreasing evidence that environmental influ-\\nences on the aging process begin in utero, has\\nled to the initiation of a new life-cycle project\\ncalled \"Fetal, Infant, and Later Aging Mark-\\ners, Cohort b. 1910-35.\" The acronym for\\nthis project is FILAM.\\nThe central objective of FILAM is the cre-\\nation of a life-cycle sample of persons born\\nbetween 1910 and 1935 that would make it\\npossible to compare changes in the aging pro-\\ncess over the period of 70 years that separate\\nthis new sample from the aging experiences of\\nthe Union Army cohort. The FILAM cohort is\\nimportant not only because it studies individ-\\nuals currently between ages 63 and 89, but also\\nbecause of the dramatic environmental and\\nearly life-style changes they experienced.\\nThese changes include the rise and partial de-\\ncline of smoking, the decline and the new rise\\nof alcohol consumption, the replacement of\\nhorses by internal combustion engines as the\\nmain source of urban vehicular power, the\\ncleaning up of the water and milk supplies, and\\nthe emergence of a wide range of effective\\nmedical interventions.\\nThe sample will be drawn from the birth\\nrecords of 10,000 men and women of differing\\nethnicities and races who were born in Boston,\\nNew York City, Baltimore, Chicago, Iowa\\nCity, and San Francisco. Approximately half\\nof the neonates will not have survived to the\\npresent day and these men and women will be\\nlinked to their death certificates. The survivors\\nwill be traced and interviewed to determine the\\npresence of chronic conditions, socioeco-\\nnomic status, and family and own health his-\\ntory. Survivors will be linked to social\\nsecurity, census, military, and tax records, sub-\\nject to their written consent.\\nFILAM will make it possible to investigate\\nthe predictive power of fetal, neonatal, and\\nearly childhood measures of retarded growth\\nsuch as weight for gestational age, ratio of pla-\\ncental weight to birth weight, infant weight\\ngain, thinness at birth, arid shortness at birth\\nrelative to head size, on the risk of developing\\nspecific chronic conditions at mid-adult and\\nlate ages. Among the chronic conditions that\\nwill be examined are coronary heart disease,\\nhypertension, stroke, obstructive lung disease,\\nnon-insulin-dependent diabetes, and autoim-\\nmune thyroiditis. FILAM will also make it\\npossible to investigate how the interaction of\\nfetal and infant developments with various risk\\nfactors at later childhood, young adult, and\\nmiddle ages may intensify or moderate risks\\nof chronic conditions and early death after age\\n65. Another objective is the analysis of differ-\\nences in the health histories, occupational his-\\ntories, and retirement pattern between FILAM\\nand the Union Army sanmple, with special em-\\nphasis on the similarities and differences of\\npredictors of later work levels, morbidity, and\\nwaiting time until death.\\nThe HRS, AHEAD, Union Army sample,\\nand FILAM all contain information on the\\nparents and children of the individuals under\\nstudy. Hence, they make it possible to ad-\\ndress some factors that may be transmitted\\nintergenerationally. An effort to utilize ar-\\nchival data to study intergenerational pro-\\ncesses is also under way. Pope (1992) is\\nlinking a large sample of genealogies to the\\nlife-cycle sample of Union Army recruits.\\nThere are at least 60,000 published family\\nhistories that contain information on over\\n100,000,000 people who ever lived in North\\nAmerica. Pope is drawing a subsample of\\nthese histories containing 10,000 men of\\nmilitary age at the time of the Civil War. It\\nis estimated that 40 percent of these men\\nserved in the Union Army. This new sample\\n(called ILAS, for intergenerationally linked\\naging sample) will be linked to the military,\\npension, medical, and census data sets pre-\\nviously discussed.\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

This\\nwill be done by including parents\\' occupation,\\nwealth, residential history, number of children,\\nplace or region of birth, and migration histoiy.\\nBrothers in ILAS share a common prewar en-\\nvironment as well as a common genetic heritage.\\nThey may also share a common war experience\\n(see D.

As\\nan alternative to the residual-covariance ap-\\nproach, a kiindred-frallty model (Vaupel, 1990)\\ncould be used where brothers share a level of\\nfrailty.

Heckman and\\nChristopher R. Taber, 1994).\\nIV. The Production and Distribution\\nof Spiritual Assets\\nThere is, finally, the issue of spiritual or im-\\nmaterial assets. A good place to begin is with\\nSocrates\\' question: What is the good life? That\\nwas a critical question not only for the sons of\\nrich Athenians but for sons of the landed rich\\nthroughout history. Freed of the need to work\\nin order to satisfy their material needs, they\\nsought self-realization in public service, mili-\\ntary adventures, philanthropy, the arts, theol-\\nogy, ethics, and moral philosophy. Their\\npreoccupation with immaterial commodities\\nled Adam Smith to argue that the landed ar-\\nistocracy ignored their property and lacked in-\\nterest in advancing methods of cultivation.\\n\"The situation of such a person,\" he wrote,\\n\"naturally disposes him to attend rather to or-\\nnamenit which please his fancy, than to profit\\nfor which he has so little occasion\" (Smith,\\n1937 pp. 364, 891-892).\\nIn a world in which all but a small percenit-\\nage are lacking in adequate nutrition and other\\nnecessities of life, self-realization may indeed\\nseem like a mere ornanent, but not in a coun-\\ntry where even the poor are rich by past or\\nThird World standards. That is the case in\\nAmerica today since the poverty line is at a\\nlevel of real income that was attained by only\\nthose in the top 10 percent of the income dis-\\ntribution a century ago\\'3 (Fogel, 2000). Tech-\\nnophysio evolution has made it possible to\\nextend the quest for self-realization from a\\nminute fraction of the population to almost the\\nwhole of it. Although those who are retired\\nwill have more time to pursue self-realization,\\neven those still in the labor force will have\\nsufficient leisure to seek it either within their\\nprofessional occupations or outside of them\\n(Peter Laslett, 1991; Hans Lenk, 1994),\\nSome proponents of egalitarianism insist\\non characterizing the material level of the\\npoor today as being harsh. They confound\\ncurrent and past conditions of living. Failure\\nto recognize the enormous material gains\\nover the last century, even for the poor, im-\\npedes rather than advances the struggle\\nagainst chronic poverty in rich nations, the\\nprincipal characteristic of which is spiritual\\nestrangement from the mainstream society.\\nAlthough material assistance is an important\\nelement in the struggle to overcome spiritual\\nestrangement, such assistance will not be\\nproperly targeted if one assumes that iin-\\nprovement in material conditions naturally\\nleads to spiritual improvement.\\nThat proposition, so widely emnbraced by the\\nnore secular of the economic reformers of the\\ntwentieth century, did more to promote the\\nconsumerism of the 1920\\'s and 1930\\'s than to\\nproduce spiritual regeneration. The middle and\\nworking classes became preoccupied with the\\nacquisition of automobiles and those house-\\nhold appliances made possible by electricity:\\n\\n###',\n",

It was this\\nconsumerism that led such progressive critics\\nof the era as Vernon Louis Parrington, pioneer\\nin the development of intellectual history, to\\ndecry the \"cash-register\" mentality of modern\\nurban life (Parrington, 1930 p. 81).\\nThe economist\\'s traditional measures of in-\\ncome inequality are inadequate measures of\\nboth egalitarian gains and egalitarian failures\\n(cf., Amartya K. Sen, 1996). They focus on a\\nvariable- money income-that currently ac-\\ncounts for less than half of real consumption\\nand which in a generation may slip to just a\\nquarter of real consumption. The most serious\\nthreats to egalitarian progress-certainly the\\nmost intractable forms of poverty-are related\\nto the unequal distribution of spiritual (im-\\nmaterial) resources (cf., William Julius\\nWilson, 1996).\\nRealization of the potential of an individual\\nis not something that can be legislated by the\\nstate, nor can it be provided to the weak by the\\nstrong. It is something that has to develop\\nwithin each individual. Moreover, which as-\\npect of one\\'s potential an individual chooses\\nto develop most fully, such as choosing a pro-\\nfession, is purely an aesthetic consideration.\\nJohn Dewey and one of his chief disciples,\\nRichard Rorty of the University of Virginia,\\ncontend that in a democracy self-realization is\\n\"4a particularized creative project of individual\\ngrowth\" (Richard Shusterman, 1994 pp. 396-\\n97). The emphasis on individual choice does\\nnot mean that other individuals and institutions\\nplay no role in shaping those choices. Quite\\nthe contrary, the quality of the choices and the\\nrange of opportunity depends critically on how\\nwell endowed an individual is with spiritual\\nresources. But the spiritual resources needed\\nfor personal development are unequally dis-\\ntributed among young and old, among men\\nand women, among various ethnic groups, and\\namong rich and poor. Those rich who are con-\\ntinuously preoccupied with sensual gratifica-\\ntions are as likely to fail in self-realization as\\nthe poor who share that preoccupation. Al-\\nthough the rich may have the wealth to buy\\nthe treatment needed from highly trained pro-\\nfessionals, inexpensive character and religious\\ncounseling may serve as well, if not better, for\\nthe addicts of all classes.\\nThe full list of maldistributed spiritual re-\\nsources is too long to discuss adequately here\\nbut I have in mind such vital assets as a vision\\nof opportunity and a work ethic. A common\\ncharacteristic of such assets is that they are\\ntransferred from one individual to another\\nmainly very early in the life of the recipient.\\nSelf-esteem and a sense of family solidarity\\nbegin to be transferred to children along with\\nmother\\'s milk and with pabulum. Other spir-\\nitual resources begin to be transferred during\\nthe toddler and toilet-training stages, including\\na sense of discipline, a capacity to resist or\\ncontrol impulses, and a sense of community.\\nTelling nursery rhymes such as \"TThis little\\npiggy went to market,\" recounting the auto-\\nbiographies of the mother and father, and fam-\\nily histories going back two or three\\ngenerations convey such spiritual resources as\\na work ethic, a sense of the mainstream of\\nwork and life, an ethic of benevolence, a vision\\nof opportunity, and a thirst for knowledge.\\nAlthough these early transfers of spiritual\\nresources are enriched and expanded by pri-\\nmary, secondary, and college education, and\\nby occupational and other later-life experi-\\nences, the salience of these later transfers de-\\npends in no small measure on what happens at\\nhome before formnal education begins. It is,\\ntherefore, necessary to remedy the maldistri-\\nbution of spiritual resources early in life, be-\\ncause the most spiritually deprived infants will\\noften be born to single, teenaged mothers who\\nare themselves spiritually deprived.\\nSome young mothers are too deprived, or\\ntoo young, to call on their own life experiences\\nto transmit a sense of discipline and of oppor-\\ntunity, a work ethic, a family ethic, a sense of\\nself-esteem, and a knowledge of the main-\\nstream of work and life. The deprivation can\\nbe addressed by promoting a system of men-\\ntoring, taking advantage of the increasingly\\nlarge number of retired men and women who\\nhave abundant -spiritual resources. Such men-\\ntoring programs would be useful, not only for\\nthe toddlers and their mothers and fathers, but\\nalso for the elderly who are looking for ways\\nto enrich their retirement years.\\nDespite the improvements in their material\\nconditions of life, including comfortable\\nstocks of consumer durables, the elderly today\\nsuffer from a maldistribution of immaterial\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Only 43 percent of that cohort\\ngraduated from high school and less than 15\\npercent entered college. Even among the\\nyoungest cohort of the elderly, those born in\\n1933 and 1934, only half graduated from high\\nschool and about 20 percent entered college\\n(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975 p. 379).\\nThese cohorts also suffered from high infant\\ndeath rates, poor nutrition in early infancy, and\\nearly onset of chronic diseases, as compared\\nwith cohorts born since World War II.\\nHence, despite their relatively high levels of\\nincome and stocks of consumer durables, the\\nmaldistribution of spiritual resources is sub-\\nstantial. Depression, alienation, and substance\\nabuse are common (S. C. Samuels, 1997).\\nThose who are most afflicted are lonely, have\\nfew communal contacts, live in retirement\\nhomes rather than in their own households,\\nand sense a loss of control over their personal\\nlives (W. L. Fletcher and R. 0. Hansson,\\n1991; K. Pahkala et al. 1992; K. Yamashita\\net al., 1993). Recent studies also indicate that\\nthose who lacked immaterial resources early\\nin life have difficulty in attaining self-\\nrealization after retirement (J. C. HIenretta,\\n1997; J. E. Mutchler et al., 1997).\\nI have emphasized the level of education be-\\ncause recent studies indicate that the capacity\\nof the elderly to engage effectively in physical\\nactivity was strongly correlated with education\\nearly in life. Education also affects cognitive\\nability and the rate of illness (J. W. Rowe and\\nR. L. Kahn, 1997). Consequently, individuals\\nwho were deprived of adequate education in\\nyouth are, for that reason among others, rela-\\ntively deprived of both physiological and spir-\\nitual resources in late life.\\nDespite the long reach of youthful depri-\\nvation, there are enough other factors affecting\\nthe quality of elderly life to pennit redistri-\\nbutions that compensate for previous deficits.\\nOn the physiological side, for example, there\\nare effective medical interventions that can in-\\ncrease the quality of life and longevity. Al-\\nthough the elderly are eligible for Medicare to\\npay for treatment, the quality of treatment is\\nvariable, and many individuals may be\\nshunted to low-quality care. Moreover, some\\ninterventions are denied, or are more reluc-  tantly ordered, for the elderly than for the mid-\\ndle aged.\\nBecause spiritual resources are so un-\\nequally distributed among the elderly, dif-\\nferent programs are needed for different\\nstrata. The mninority of the current elderly\\nwho are well educated, the 14 percent with\\nat least bachelor\\'s degrees, most of whom\\nhad professional careers, have developed\\nsome innovative programs (U.S. Bureau of\\nthe Census, 1997 p. 160). In Great Britain\\none of these is called the \"University of the\\nThird Age.\" This educational program is not\\naimed at providing credentials for those\\nabout to embark upon new careers, but at\\nsatisfying the thirst for knowledge. It is\\nbased on the proposition that education, and\\nthe acquired knowledge and skills, are a\\nsource of self-satisfaction, even if they do\\nnot enhance an individual\\'s employability.\\nAs Laslett (1991 pp. 171-71) put it:\\nReading in a literature, mastering a lan-\\nguage, unraveling a point in logic or phi-\\nlosophy, understanding the objectives\\nset for themselves by poets, painters,\\nnovelists or architects, these things ex-\\ntend your appreciation and your miastery\\nof your world, your objective and your\\nsubjective world as well. They are ful-\\nfilling, and adding to other people\\'s\\nknowledge is the most fulfilling of all.\\nPrograms su\\'h as the University of the\\nThird Age will become increasingly important\\nas the baby boomers and others of the more\\nhighly educated cohorts of the post-World\\nWar :I era begin to retire. However, today and\\nfor the next decade, the bulk of the elderly\\nlacks the skills to create and participate in such\\nhigh-level programs as the University of the\\nThird Age. A recent survey of adult literacy\\nrevealed that more than half of the elderly pop-\\nulation suffers from functional illiteracy.\\nThese individuals may be able to sign their\\nname or read very simple material, but they\\ncannot follow instructions for taking medi-\\ncines or cope with a variety of documents en-\\ncountered in daily living (R.

Government cannot legislate\\nthe transfer of virtue as it does with money\\nincome.

But this process of\\ncorrecting the maldistribution of spiritual re-\\nsources not only leaves those who are deprived\\nbetter off, it also increases the spiritual re-\\nsources of those who have virtue in abun-\\ndance. In contrast to income redistribution,\\nspiritual redistribution is not a fixed-sum game\\nin which some people can become better off\\nonly if other people are made worse off.

At least two millennia earlier\\nit was written in the Bible: \"When goods in-\\ncrease, those who eat them increase.\" (Ecclesi-\\nastes 5.)\\nQuintus Septimus Florence Tertillianus wrote:\\nIndeed it is certain, it is clear to see, that\\nthe earth itself is currently more culti-\\nvated and developed than in earlier times.\\nNow all places are accessible, all are doc-\\nurnented, all are full of business. The\\nmost charming farms obliterate empty\\nplaces, ploughed fields vanquish forests,\\nherds drive out wild beasts, sandy places\\nare planted with crops, stones are fixed,\\nswamps drained, and there are such great\\ncities where formerly hardly a hut ... ev-\\nerywhere there is a dwelling, everywhere\\na multitude, everywhere a government,\\neverywhere there is life. The greatest ev-\\nidence of the large number of people: we\\nare burdensome to the world, the re-\\nsources are scarcely adequate to us; and\\nour needs straiten us and complaints are\\neverywhere while already nature does not\\nsustain us.

(Malthus, 1992\\npp. 330-31.)\\nUnfortunately, the Malthus of the first edition\\nprovided a model of population growth that\\naccurately depicted the experience of nearly all\\nof human history and was generally valid up to\\nthe time he wrote. But he was also correct in his\\nview that during the century following the pub-\\nlication of the essay that there would be gradual\\nimprovement in the well-being of people in the\\npart of the world where he lived, namely Eu-\\nrope. However, the progress was neither uni-\\nform nor without interruption, as witness the\\nIrish famine of the 1840's and other famines\\nand food shortages that occurred in several Eu-\\nropean countries during the nineteenth century.\\nIn the second edition he recognized a third\\nfactor that affected population growth in addi-\\ntion to vice and misery-namely, the desire for\\nself-improvement. In other words, families\\nwere willing and capable of influencing the\\nnumber of children by changing the age of\\nmarriage, for example.\\nWhat made it possible for the world to escape\\nfrom what could be called the Malthusian trap?\\nThe answer is simple: the creation of knowl-\\nedge.1 While there had been improvements in\\nagriculture for many millennia through knowl-\\nedge gained from practical experience-learn-\\ning by doing-there was an explosion of\\nknowledge over the past two centuries that\\nmade possible an unparalleled increase in per\\ncapita well-being, not just in terms of food but\\nin all aspects of life. Fundamentally, new tech-\\nnologies have been developed at a rate unprec-\\nedented by historical standards.\\nConsider the following (Angus Maddison,\\n1995):\\n1. The increase in the world's population in the\\ndecade of the 1980's of 844 million was\\nnearly as large as the world's total popula-\\ntion in 1800 of 900 million.\\n2. During the decade of the 1980's the increase\\nin the world's gross domestic product per\\ncapita equaled the estimated per capita gross\\ndomestic product in 1820 (Maddison, 1995\\np. 228).\\nMeasured in 1990$, in the 1980's the per\\ncapita GDP increased by $661; the per capita\\nfigure for 1820 was $651.\\n3. The physical world-the land, the water, the\\nair, the sun-was basically the same in the\\n1980's as it was in 1820 or 1020 or 109000\\nyears ago. Some might argue that the phys-\\nical world was less valuable than in the past.\\nThe magnitude of the increase in the world's\\noutput since 1820 is much greater than is di-\\nrectly implied by the comparability of the in-\\ncrease in GDP during the 1980's and in all\\nhistory up to 1820. The increase in real world\\noutput during the 1980's was more than 10\\ntimes the output in 1820 and the world output in\\n1990 was 40 times that of 1820. How could\\nthese enormous changes have occurred? They\\noccurred because we have found ways to offset\\nthe limitations that natural resources imposed\\non the world's output in times past as well as\\nimproving greatly the amount and productivity\\nof human capital. We have not found how to\\nrepeal the principle of diminishing marginal\\nreturns. But we have found low cost and abun-\\ndant substitutes for natural resources important\\nin the production process.\\nAs I will show later, the improvement in\\nwell-being of the world's population goes far\\nbeyond the enormous increase in the value of\\nthe world's output. The improvements are evi-\\ndent in fewer famines, increased caloric intakes,\\nreduced child and infant mortality, increased\\nlife expectancy, great reductions in time\\nworked, and greatly increased percentage of the\\npopulation that is literate.\\n\\n###\",\n",

The second\\nfactor is the enormous increase in knowledge\\nover the past two centuries made possible by\\nincreasing population and rising real per capita\\nincomes resulting from the economic growth\\nfrom the mid-eighteenth century. The increase\\nin real incomes permitted the allocation of sub-\\nstantial resources to the creation of knowledge.\\nThis reallocation was associated with the rapid\\ndevelopment of two institutions- universities\\nand research institutes. The third factor, con-\\ntrary to what is often assumed, is that the re-\\nsponse of families to the removal of restraints\\non their well-being imposed by limited food\\nsupplies was not significantly increased fertil-\\nity; population growth resulted primarily from\\nmortality declines. Population growth was not\\nlimited by the supply of food but by the deci-\\nsions of families.\\nThe three reasons do not fully explain why\\npopulation growth did not spoil everything for\\nthe developed world in the nineteenth century\\nand for the developing world more recently.\\nOne reason the growth of food output in the\\nnineteenth century may not have been over-\\nwhelmed by population growth was that knowl-\\nedge and technology required for the rapid\\nreduction of mortality did not become generally\\navailable until near the end of the nineteenth\\ncentury and, further, the rapid increase in the\\npopulation of cities limited the decline in mor-\\ntality. The decline in mortality in the developing\\nworld in the twentieth century was far more\\nrapid and resulted in a much higher rate of\\npopulation growth than the experience of the\\nnineteenth century even though fertility de-\\nclined significantly.\\nII. Agriculture and Food Before the\\nNineteenth Century\\nAgriculture is a relatively recent invention-\\nthe transformation from hunting and gathering\\nto planting and growing crops and domesticat-\\ning animals probably occurred about 10 millen-\\nnia ago. At that time the world's population was\\nabout 4 million and a large fraction of all re-\\nsources were devoted to obtaining food, and a\\nvery poor lot it was.\\nAs of 1800 it is estimated that '75 to 80\\npercent of the working population in the devel-\\noped world was engaged in agriculture (Bai-\\nroch, 1988 p. 287). In the rest of the world, with\\nnearly 80 percent of the world's population, the\\npercentage of workers engaged in agriculture\\nwas certainly higher-of the order of 85 to 90\\npercent. In 1891, 90 percent of the population of\\nIndia was rural (Adna Ferrin Weber, 1899 p.\\n124) and as late as 1949, 89 percent of China's\\npopulation was rural.2 Unfortunately we do not\\nhave evidence that permits -us to directly deter-\\nmine the amount of food available in ancient\\ntimes. But if life expectancy in Roman times\\nwere 25 years (Donald J. Bogue, 1969 p. 566),\\nit is highly probable that the available food per\\ncapita was very limited. Fogel has estimated the\\n\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

It was not until the sev-\\nenteenth century that there is evidence that life\\nexpectancy increased significantly beyond what\\nit was in Roman or earlier times. As noted,\\nEngland and France, two of the wealthiest na-\\ntions of the world, had life expectancies at the\\nbeginning of the eighteenth century that were\\nnot much above what had prevailed throughout\\nhuman history.\\nIt is probable that the per capita calorie sup-\\nplies for the world prior to the seventeenth\\ncentury were in the range found in England and\\nFrance at the beginning of the eighteenth cen-\\ntury-perhaps from 1,650 to less than 2,000.\\nThese are in the range of calorie intakes in many\\ndeveloping countries in 1934-1938, the earliest\\ndate for which we have estimates for several\\ncountries. Calorie intakes in India, the Philip-\\npines, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico were in the\\nrange of 1,800 to 2,000 calories (M. K. Bennett,\\n1976 p. 199). By 1934-1938 these countries\\nhad significant population growth rates and at\\nearlier times consumption was probably rather\\nless.\\nImportant evidence that the productivity of\\nagricultural resources in Europe remained rela-\\ntively constant and low was that in Europe,\\nexcluding Russia, there was almost no change\\nin the percentage of the total urban population\\nbetween 1300 and 1800. Bairoch (1988 pp. 177,\\n216) estimates that in 1300 the urban population\\nof Europe was 10.4 percent of the total; five\\ncenturies later in 1800 it was only 12.1 percent\\nand most of this increase occurred in England in\\nthe eighteenth century. The nineteenth century\\nsaw a major increase in urbanization; by the end\\nof the nineteenth century the urban population\\nwas 37.9 percent of Europe's population, Rus-\\nsia excluded. The urban population increased\\nalmost five times in the nineteenth century after\\nlittle more than doubling in the previous five\\ncenturies (Bairoch, 1988 pp. 177, 216). The\\ndevelopment of cities as a significant share of\\nthe total population became possible only after\\nfarmers increased production relative to their\\nown consumption.\\nFurther evidence that per capita output of\\nagriculture increased very little throughout his-\\ntory was the slow growth of world population\\nuntil nearly the beginning of the nineteenth cen-\\ntury. During the first millennium of the current\\nera, the annual rate of growth was 0.04 percent,\\na doubling time of 1700 years. In the 700 years\\nending in 1700, the rate of population growth\\nwas 0.12 percent, a doubling time of about 580\\nyears. The rate of population growth did in-\\ncrease in the eighteenth century-to 0.41 per-\\ncent annually. But even at that rate it would take\\n179 years to double.\\nEurope's population during the eighteenth\\ncentury increased from 102 million to 154 mil-\\nlion and this increase was made possible by a\\nsignificant increase in food production oc-\\ncurred. However, except in England, there was\\nno increase in urbanization so it is reasonable to\\ninfer that in the rest of Europe the growth of\\nfood production increased at approximately the\\nsame rate as population during the eighteenth\\ncentury.\\nI[I.

As I have noted, the share\\nof cities in Europe's population had remained\\nnearly constant for the previous five centuries,\\nand that this meant that the available food sup-\\nply had not increased significantly faster than\\npopulation and, equally important, that the pro-\\nductivity of labor in agriculture also had not\\nincreased enough to permit labor to transfer out\\nof agriculture and migrate to cities. The mid-\\npoint of the eighteenth century marks a striking\\ndividing point in the demographic and agricul-\\ntural history of England. In the century up to\\n1750 England's population was static. It actu-\\nally declined in some periods and increased at\\nan annual rate of only 0.1 percent or by 10\\npercent in the entire century (E. A. Wrigley and\\nR. S. Schofield, 1981 pp. 528-29). Life expect-\\nancy may have actually declined. But between\\n1751 and 1801 its population grew at an annual\\nrate of 0.81 percent and the total increased by\\n50 percent. In the next half century the popula-\\ntion nearly doubled. Nearly all of the increase in\\nthe United Kingdom's population in the nine-\\nteenth century was urban (Bairoch, 1988\\np. 290).4\\nWhat increased productivity in agriculture so\\nstrikingly after 1750? Exact causes are un-\\nknown, but many changes were involved, in-\\ncluding the spread of two high-yielding crops\\nfrom the Americas-corn (maize) and potatoes,\\nthe enclosure movement, the elimination of fal-\\nlow, improved drainage, and increased avail-\\nability of animal manure made possible by the\\ncultivation of turnips as feed for cattle (David S.\\nLandes, 1969 p. 76). There was a major increase\\nin England and the Netherlands in the grain-to-\\nseed ratio to more than ten in 1750-1820 com-\\npared to seven in the two centuries prior to 1700\\n(B. H. Slicher van Bath, 1963).5 Such a large\\nincrease in yield was almost certainly associated\\nwith a significant increase in labor productivity.\\nWhile urbanization increased very little in En-\\ngland during the last half of the eighteenth cen-\\ntury, there was a significant expansion of\\nindustrial activity in rural areas, especially in\\nthe production of textiles.\\nSignificant increases in per capita food pro-\\nduction and in labor productivity in agriculture\\nwere necessary conditions for the Industrial\\nRevolution which was associated with, and may\\nwell have been advanced by, rapid population\\ngrowth. The increase in food production was\\nnecessary to sustain the rapid population\\ngrowth; the growth in agricultural labor produc-\\ntivity was required to permit a reduction in the\\nshare of labor devoted to farming and to permit\\nthe transfer of labor to the cities. I do not argue\\nthat the improvements in food supply and labor\\nproductivity were sufficient conditions for the\\nIndustrial Revolution. It is quite probable that\\nthe agricultural and industrial revolutions had\\nthe same sources and each was affected by\\ndevelopments in the other.\\nIV.

       " \"major source of calories has been grain-of the\\norder of 75 to 80 percent (Bennett, 1976 p. 206).\\nUntil the early nineteenth century the serious\\nbottleneck in the production of grain was har-\\nvesting. The plow was introduced several mil-\\nlennia before, and it saved labor, but at a time of\\nthe year when labor was not scarce. Plowing\\ncould be done over an extended period of time,\\nbut harvesting in most areas had to be done in a\\nbrief period to prevent the crop being harmed or\\ndestroyed by wind, rain, or frost.\\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century\\ngrain was harvested by the same methods as in\\nthe fourteenth century and probably much ear-\\nlier-the sickle, the scythe, and the cradle. T'he\\ninvention and introduction of the reaper in\\nAmerica in the second quarter of the nineteenth\\ncentury changed all that. The reaper was soon\\nfollowed by the binder, which was a reaper with\\nan attachment that brought the grain straw to-\\ngether in a bundle and tied it with twine. The\\nbinder was complemented by the thresher that\\nsaved a great deal of labor, though at a time less\\ncritical than the savings made possible by the\\nreaper and binder. In turn the binder and\\nthresher were largely replaced by the combine,\\nbut not until well into the twentieth century.\\nMany other machines and tools were part of\\nthe mechanical revolution. Very important\\nwas harnessing the internal combustion en-\\ngine to create the tractor. The labor savings of\\nthe mechanical revolution were enormous. It\\nis estimated that the direct labor input used to\\nproduce a ton of grain in the United States\\ndeclined by 70 percent in the nineteenth cen-\\ntury (Martin R. Cooper et al., 1947). Conse-\\nquently in the developed countries after the\\nmid-nineteenth century the transfer of labor\\nfrom agriculture to nonagricultural pursuits\\nwas more likely limited by the rate of growth\\nof nonagricultural employment than by the\\nlabor requirements of agriculture.\\nV. Land Was Not the Scarce Resource\\nWhile today many give emphasis to the lim-\\nited supply of land of good quality as a major\\nimpediment to further increases in food produc-\\ntion, throughout nearly all of human history\\nland has not been an important factor limiting\\nproduction. It had to have been something else\\nwhen the world's population was 500 million,\\nas it was in the sixteenth century, or perhaps\\neven when the population first reached one bil-\\nlion, early in the nineteenth century. Given the\\nstate of knowledge that existed until quite re-\\ncently, the primary limiting factor was labor.\\nLabor limited the amount of food that could be\\nproduced by a family and, as noted, for much of\\nhuman history, farm families were barely able\\nto produce enough for their own consumption\\nwith little surplus for trade with others. Until\\nquite recently this surplus was hardly more than\\na quarter or a fifth of what they produced. A\\ngood indicator that land was not the limiting\\nfactor is that until the beginning of the nine-\\nteenth century yields were calculated per unit of\\nseed, not per unit of land (Slicher van Bath,\\n1963).\\nEster Boserup (1965) makes a convincing\\ncase that labor and not land was the limiting\\nfactor in agricultural output until quite recently.\\nShe showed how farmers adapted to increasing\\npopulation by modifying the ways that land was\\nutilized, shifting from slash and burn and long\\nfallow to shorter periods of fallow and in West-\\nern Europe eliminating fallow entirely. They\\nfound ways other than fallow to maintain the\\nfertility of the soil-the use of manure and\\nlegumes, for example. These changes were the\\nresult of new knowledge, knowledge largely\\nderived from experience of the farmers them-\\nselves and were a response to the growing pop-\\nulation and the need to expand food production.\\nVI. The Increased Role of Knowledge\\nAs noted, the enormous increase in the\\nworld's output over the past two centuries has\\nbeen due in large part to the advancement of\\nknowledge combined with the increase in hu-\\nman resources, both in number and capabilities,\\nand savings translated into physical capital. We\\ndo not have more natural resources than existed\\nin the distant past, yet output has increased\\nmany fold. What is the source of the increased\\nknowledge? Two factors have been important-\\none is simply the growth of population and the\\nother is that rising real per capita incomes have\\nmade it possible for specialization in the pro-\\nduction of knowledge and for devoting a signif-\\nicant share of our resources to that effort.\\nMichael Kremer (1993) makes a convincing\\ncase for the conclusion that a larger population\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

Second, with a\\nlarger population, there are more individuals\\ncapable of making a significant discovery or\\nadding to knowledge. It is not that today we are\\nsmarter or more intelligent than populations a\\ncentury ago, two centuries ago, or a millennium\\nago. Presumably the distribution of talents or\\nintelligence is the same today as at any past\\ntime. But there are many, many more of us and\\nif the distribution of talents has not changed,\\nthere are many more individuals capable of\\nadvancing knowledge.\\nBut it is not only that there are more of us\\navailable to add to the world's knowledge, but\\nwith the improvements in agricultural produc-\\ntivity, the expansion of the cities, and the very\\nlarge increases in real per capita incomes that\\nhave occurred over the past two centuries, in-\\nstitutions have been created specifically to ad-\\nvance and transmit knowledge. I refer to\\nuniversities and research institutes, including\\nboth public and private ones. It was not that\\nprior to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\\nthat there were no individuals who had the\\nintelligence, time, curiosity, and energy for the\\ncreation of knowledge. But their numbers were\\nlimited. Our lives, however, are greatly influ-\\nenced by those who developed the reaper and\\nthe binder, the internal combustion engine, the\\nsteam engine, the railroad, electricity, the tele-\\nphone, and by those who discovered the small\\npox vaccine and the germ theory of disease. But\\nby the beginning of the twentieth century their\\neffects on the lives of individuals were limited\\ncompared to the effects of the recent increases\\nin knowledge and their applications.\\nWhen as many as 80 to 85 percent of the\\nworld's labor force was engaged in farming, a\\nsmall percentage of a much smaller world pop-\\nulation had the time and resources to devote to\\nproducing nonfood products, such as clothing,\\ntools, roads, and housing, let alone acquiring\\nnew knowledge and technology. In 1990 in the\\ndeveloped world no more than 10 percent of its\\nlabor force was engaged in agriculture and in\\nthe developing world approximately 60 percent\\n(World Bank, 1997 p. 220). Not only are there\\nabout seven times as many people as there were\\nin 1800, but a significant percentage of this\\nmuch larger population specializes in the cre-\\nation of knowledge compared to the very small\\nnumber who could do so just two centuries ago.\\nThe modern university, with many faculty de-\\nvoting their time to research in science and\\ngraduate education, is a very recent creation-\\nsuch institutions hardly existed before the mid-\\ndle of the nineteenth century.

In that\\nyear there were 563 colleges and universities\\nwith a total faculty of 5,553 and 52,000 stu-\\ndents. The contribution to new knowledge had\\nto be limited; there were approximately ten fac-\\nulty members per institution, including, I as-\\nsume, the president who probably spent much\\nof the available time trying to find enough fi-\\nnancial resources to keep the institution open.\\nSixty years later, for example, there were\\n82,000 faculty, 1.1 million students, and 2,299\\ndoctorates awarded. Further rapid expansion of\\nhigher education came after World War II and\\nby 1994/1995 there were an estimated 915,000\\nfaculty, 14.3 million students, and 43,000 doc-\\ntorates awarded (Thomas I).

Equally important is that\\nthe share of resources devoted to the wide dis-\\ntribution of that knowledge has also increased\\ngreatly.\\nVII. Population Growth-Roles of Fertility\\nand Mortality\\nMy third point is that population growth in\\nthe developed countries in the nineteenth cen-\\ntury and in the developing countries in the twen-\\ntieth century was due almost entirely to\\nmortality declines and not to fertility increases.\\nIn other words, the response of men and women\\nto improved circumstances-improved nutri-\\ntion and higher incomes-was not to increase\\nfertility significantly. For the nineteenth century\\nthe picture is clear. For the three European\\ncountries, both fertility and mortality declined.\\nIn England and Sweden there was an increase in\\nfertility during the latter half of the eighteenth\\ncentury but the increase was small (less than 10\\npercent) and lasted less than 50 years before\\ndeclining throughout the nineteenth century.\\nThe increases in fertility had little or no effect\\non population growth in Europe, with a modest\\npositive effect in Sweden and England from\\nperhaps 1750 to 1800, but with declines\\nthroughout the nineteenth century.\\nThe total fertility rate (average number of\\nchildren per woman) for Sweden increased from\\n4.21 in 1750 to 4.68 in 1800 but then declined\\ncontinuously throughout the nineteenth century,\\nreaching a level of 1.90 in 1990 (Massimo Livi-\\nBacci, 1992 p. 122). Life expectancy in the last\\n20 years of the eighteenth century was 34 years,\\nincreasing to 39 years by 1835 and to 54 years\\nin the first decade of the twentieth century\\n(Nathan Keyfitz and Wilhelm Flieger, 1968 pp.\\n36-37).\\nTotal fertility rates for England increased\\nfrom 5.28 in 1750 to 5.87 in 1775 and then\\ndeclined to 1.96 in 1900 (Livi-Bacci, 1989 p.\\n122). In the early period of the Industrial Rev-\\nolution there seems to have been a small posi-\\ntive response in fertility to the improved\\ncircumstances that lasted less than half a cen-\\ntury and had only a modest effect on the rate of\\npopulation growth. In England life expectancy\\nwas 32 years in the last fifth of the seventeenth\\ncentury and remained at that level in the years\\nbefore 1750. It increased to 36 years by the end\\nof the eighteenth century and to 41 years by the\\nmiddle of the nineteenth century (Wrigley and\\nSchofield, 1981 pp. 528-29) and continued to\\nincrease thereafter. In France the fertility and\\nmortality trends are very clear-the total fertil-\\nity rate was low in 1825 at 3.42 and fell con-\\ntinuously reaching 2.14 in 1900 (Livi-Bacci,\\n1992 p. 122). Life expectancy increased from\\nabout 28 years in 1760 to 40 years in 1840 and\\nto 46 years at the end of the century (Wrigley,\\n1987 pp. 274).\\nThe data on fertility and mortality available\\nfor the developing countries since 1960 prove\\nthat the source of the rapid population growth in\\nthese countries was the decline in mortality\\nrather than an increase in fertility. In fact, both\\nmortality and fertility fell much more rapidly in\\nthe developing countries in the twentieth cen-\\ntury than in the developed countries in the nine-\\nteenth century prior to 1875.7 Excluding China,\\nwhich has had coercive restraints on fertility,\\nthe decline in fertility in the 31 lowest-income\\ncountries from 1960 to 1995 was 38 percent\\n(United Nations Development Program\\n[UNDP], 1998). Over the same period of time,\\nlife expectancy increased from 42 years to 59\\nyears for the same countries. But the fertility\\ndecline lagged behind the mortality decline by a\\ndecade or more and high rates of population\\ngrowth occurred in the 1960's and the 1970's.\\nFor example, between 1960 and 1978, in the 38\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

The annual population growth rate\\nfor the same countries was 2.5 percent for\\n1960-1970 and 2.2 percent for 1970-1978\\n(World Bank, 1980).\\nWhy has fertility declined as real per capita\\nincomes have increased? At low levels of in-\\ncome, with agriculture as the major occupation,\\nchildren have a positive benefit in increasing the\\nlevel of income of the parents as well as pro-\\nviding security against illness and old age. Chil-\\ndren, and their growth and development, enter\\ninto the utility functions of parents positively.\\nParents realize satisfaction both in terms of the\\nquantity and quality of their children (Becker,\\n1991). As real per capita incomes increase, the\\nstructure of the benefits from children change.\\nThe direct contribution of children to the in-\\ncome and material welfare of their parents di-\\nminishes and in urban communities becomes\\nnegative; even in agricultural communities\\nwhere incomes and the level of mechanization\\nare high, children make modest contributions to\\ncurrent incomes and fertility in rural and urban\\nareas in the United States are now the same.\\nHowever, the utility that parents derive from\\ntheir children's growth and development in-\\ncreases as their incomes increase and the em-\\nphasis on the quality is reflected in increased\\ninvestment in their children.

Why the Nineteenth Century Had Lower\\nPopulation Growth\\nThe differences in the population growth\\nrates between Europe in the nineteenth century\\nand in the developing countries in the twentieth\\ncentury are very great. During the first half of\\nthe nineteenth century, the annual growth rate\\nfor Europe (excluding Russia) was 0.55 percent;\\nfrom 1850 to 1880, 0.60, and for the last two\\ndecades, 0.80 percent. The annual rate of in-\\ncrease for the developing regions for 1950 to\\n1995 was 2.0 percent. In 1900 Europe's popu-\\nlation (excluding Russia) was 285 million. If\\nEurope's population during the nineteenth cen-\\ntury had grown at the developing countries' rate\\nfrom 1950 to 1995, its population would have\\nexceeded a billion in 1900, more than three\\ntimes its actual population. Could Europe have\\naccommodated such a large population in 1900\\nwithout a significant reduction in its real per\\ncapita income at the end of the century? Obvi-\\nously we will never know, but it seems very\\nunlikely that it could have unless many of the\\ntechnological developments of the twentieth\\ncentury had occurred much, much earlier. While\\nit was true that the rate of economic growth, as\\nmeasured by changes in real GDP per capita,\\nwas much slower in Europe in the nineteenth\\ncentury than in the developing countries in the\\ntwentieth century (Maddison, 1995), it is worth\\nexploring why population growth was relatively\\nslow in Europe.\\nOne factor responsible for the slow growth of\\npopulation in Europe was the significant in-\\ncrease in the percentage of the population living\\nin cities-in 1800 the percentage was 12.1 and\\nin 1900 it was 37.9. Throughout the nineteenth\\ncentury, cities had much higher rates of mortal-\\nity than rural areas. Migration from rural areas\\nwas the source of the growth of cities. Not only\\ndid death rates in cities exceed birth rates, but\\ntheir death rates were significantly higher than\\nin rural areas.\\nBairoch (1988 p. 230) reports that in Western\\nEurope throughout the nineteenth century infant\\nmortality rates in urban areas exceeded the rates\\nin rural areas by 30 to 60 percent. In Sweden in\\nthe early nineteenth century infant deaths ac-\\ncounted for approximately 25 percent of all\\ndeaths (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1968). But the dif-\\nference in mortality was not confined to infants;\\nlife expectancy at age 15 in Sweden was more\\nthan four years higher in rural than in urban\\nareas in 1881-1890 (Bairoch, 1988 p. 235).8\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

       " \"The difference between population growth rates\\nin the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was\\ndue primarily to the advancement of knowledge\\nand technology that permitted much more rapid\\nreductions in mortality in the twentieth century,\\neven in the world's poorest countries. There\\nwas rather limited progress in reducing death\\nrates until the midpoint of the nineteenth cen-\\ntury in Sweden and significantly later for En-\\ngland. The basic environmental problems of\\nunclean water, inadequate sanitation, and child-\\nhood infectious diseases still took a major toll\\nuntil the early years of the twentieth century.\\nThe infant mortality rate in New York City in\\n1890 was 264 per 1,000 births, more than dou-\\nble the rate of 121 in rural areas (Weber, 1899).\\nThe rates of decline in fertility in the devel-\\noping world were greater than in the developed\\nworld for the periods under consideration. How-\\never, the crude birth rates in the developing\\nworld started their decline from a much higher\\nlevel than existed in the developed world in the\\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The crude\\nbirth rates in Sweden and England in the eigh-\\nteenth and early nineteenth centuries were in the\\nrange of 35 to 37 per thousand population while\\nthe averages for low-income countries in 1960\\nwas 48 and the average for middle-income\\ncountries was 40 (World Bank, 1980). Conse-\\nquently, the birth rate in the low-income coun-\\ntries needed to fall by a third just to reach the\\nlevel prevailing in Western Europe at the be-\\nginning of the Industrial Revolution. The more\\nrapid growth of population in today's develop-\\ning world was not due to increases in fertility\\nbut to the combined effects of high initial rates\\nof fertility and rapid declines in mortality.\\nIX. Wide Distribution of Benefits of Knowledge\\nIn recent years a great deal of concern has\\nbeen expressed about the lack of convergence of\\nper capita income among countries and increas-\\ning inequality within countries. The emphasis\\non increased income inequality has left the im-\\npression that most measures of well-being have\\nbecome much more unequal as well. The use of\\ndifferences in per capita incomes as measures of\\neither satisfaction or well-being assumes that\\nthese measures are proportional to income, a\\nconclusion that cannot be supported.\\nContrary to views that are widely held, for\\nseveral important measures of well-being there\\nhas been great improvement, both absolutely\\nand relatively, in the lives of the people of the\\nlow-income developing countries.9 The benefits\\nof the growth of knowledge have not been re-\\nstricted to the countries responsible for the ad-\\nvances in knowledge but have spread\\nthroughout most of the world. And they would\\nhave spread more quickly and more widely if\\nthe policies of many governments had been\\nmore supportive of economic growth and\\ndevelopment.\\nImprovements in the conditions of life in\\nterms of nutrition, infant mortality, and life ex-\\npectancy, have occurred at a much faster pace in\\nthe developing countries in the twentieth cen-\\ntury than in the developed countries in the nine-\\nteenth century. These improvements have\\noccurred with much larger populations and\\ngreater population densities. The population of\\nthe developing countries at the end of the twen-\\ntieth century is 4.84 billion, an increase of 350\\npercent in a century. This compares to the in-\\ncrease in Europe in the nineteenth century of 85\\npercent.

       " 'A striking difference between the developing\\ncountries at the end of the twentieth century and\\nthe developed countries at the end of the nine-\\nteenth century is that the lowest-income coun-\\ntries have achieved rates of infant mortality and\\nlife expectancy that are significantly superior to\\nthose attained at the end of the nineteenth cen-\\ntury in the developed countries.\\nThe infant mortality rate for 30 low-income\\ndeveloping countries, including China, in\\n1960 was 157 per thousand births and it de-\\nclined by 62 percent to 62 in 1996 (IJNDP,\\n1998). The infant mortality rate in 1900 in\\nnine European countries ranged from a low of\\n121 in Denmark to a high of 216 in Austria\\n(Bairoch, 1988 p. 231). The rate in the United\\nStates was 160. The teeming cities of the\\ndeveloping world are often viewed negatively\\nby observers from the developed world. A\\nrecent publication has the title \"The Poverty\\nof Cities in the Developing World\" (Martin\\nBrockerhoff and Ellen Brennan, 1997). Yet\\nthe study revealed that cities with a popula-\\ntion of a million or more included in their\\nsample had an infant mortality rate of 60 per\\nthousand births in the 1990\\'s (Brockerhoff\\nand Brennan, 1997 p. 24). Two comparisons\\nare relevant. Estimates of infant mortality for\\nthe first decade of the twentieth century were\\n500 to 600 for Bombay and 350 to 400 in\\nSingapore (Bairoch, 1988 p. 450). The infant\\nmortality rate in New York City at the begin-\\nning of the twentieth century was 264 (We-\\nber, 1899 p. 346).\\nWhile infant mortality rates in cities in the\\ndeveloped world at the beginning of the twen-\\ntieth century were higher than in rural areas, in\\nthe developing world the rates in the cities are\\nnow below those in rural areas (Brockerhoff and\\nBrennan, 1997 p. 24). These data indicate both\\nthe large magnitude of the declines and the\\nextent to which the improvements have been\\nwidely shared, even among many of the lowest-\\nincome families in the world.\\nSignificant increases in life expectancy were\\nachieved between 1900 and mid-century in the\\ndeveloping countries, though much greater ab-\\nsolute increases came later. The best available\\nlong-term data are for India, at least one benefit\\nof being a British colony. Life expectancy in\\nIndia in 1900 was 23 years, increasing to 32\\nyears in the 1940\\'s (Bogue, 1969 p. 572) and to\\n43 years in 1960 and 62 years in 1996.10 Life\\nexpectancy increased by 170 percent in a cen-\\ntury--it is now almost three times what it was a\\nhundred years ago. Life expectancy in the\\nworld\\'s poorest countries has increased since\\n1940 at a far more rapid rate than achieved in\\nany country in the developed world in the nine-\\nteenth century. This is an area where there has\\nbeen convergence between the rich and the poor\\ncountries over the past several decades. At the\\nend of the nineteenth century life expectancy in\\nseven industrial countries ranged from 46 to 51\\n(Bogue, 1969). In 33 low-income countries in\\n1996 life expectancy was 64 years, compared to\\n44 years in 1960, an absolute increase of 20\\nyears (World Bank, 1998). Furthermore, the\\nimprovements in infant mortality and life ex-\\npectancy have been achieved at lower levels of\\nreal per capita incomes than those prevailing in\\nthe developed countries at the beginning of the\\ntwentieth century (Maddison, 1995). The\\nknowledge about the benefits of clean water and\\nsanitation has been widely distributed and in-\\nvestments have been made to make those ben-\\nefits widely available.\"\\nSince the late 1940\\'s there has been greater\\nimprovement in the world\\'s availability of food\\nthan had occurred in all previous history. The\\nevidence is the increase in per capita food sup-\\nplies that occurred in the developing countries,\\nwith nearly 80 percent of the world\\'s popula-\\ntion.

In 1994-1996 the supply was\\n2,580 (Nikos Alexandratos, 1999 p. 5908)-a\\nremarkable increase of 33 percent, given that\\npopulation doubled during the period. Based on\\nthe increase in per capita grain production from\\n1948-1952 to 1961-1963, it can be estimated\\nthat the per capita calorie supply was about\\n1,700 in 1948-1952. The increase in calories\\nper capita available in the developing countries\\nfrom 1948-1952 to 1994-1996 was of the or-\\nder of 50 percent.12 Since developing countries\\nproduce at least 90 percent of the food they\\nconsume, this means that food production al-\\nmost trebled in four decades! This could not\\nhave happened prior to the last half of the twen-\\ntieth century; the knowledge that made it pos-\\nsible did not then exist.\\nAlexandratos (1999 p. 5908) provides a pic-\\nture of the improvement in food supplies that\\nadds another dimension to the increase in the\\nper capita availability in the developing coun-\\ntries: \" ... the part of the world population living\\nin countries where per capita food supplies are\\nstill very low (under 2,200 k/cal/day) decreased\\nconsiderably to only 10% in the mid-1990s,\\ndown from 56% 30 years earlier.\" Note that the\\n2,200 calories per day that is now defined as\\nvery low is somewhat higher than was available\\nin England and significantly higher than in\\nFrance in 1800, just two centuries ago. True, the\\naverage citizen of England and France as of\\n1800 was stunted and/or wasted-as short in\\nheight and low in weight-just as the average\\nperson in the developing countries with signif-\\nicantly less than 2,200 calories per day would\\nbe similarly designated today. What is impor-\\ntant is that this level of consumption applies to\\ncountries with only a tenth of the world\\'s pop-\\nulation while 200 years ago it applied to nearly\\nall of the world\\'s population.\\nIt is estimated that in 1990 approximately\\n780 million persons (19 percent of the develop-\\ning-country population, down from 36 percent\\nin 1969-1971) were malnourished (Alexandra-\\ntos, 1995 p. 33). There is an adequate quantity\\nof food now produced to provide these people\\nwith sufficient calories. However, as Adam\\nSmith taught us, policies are an important factor\\ndetermining how well a nation utilizes its re-\\nsources. The majority of the malnourished peo-\\nple live in rural areas and most of them live in\\ncountries that have had policies that discrimi-\\nnated against agriculture and rural people for all\\nor part of the last three decades. The most\\neffective means to eliminate such malnutrition\\nis to increase the incomes of farm people in\\nthese countries, something that would occur\\nwith more appropriate policies (Johnson, 1999\\np. 52).\\nIn my opening sentence I stated that not only\\nare people better fed than ever before, but they\\nacquire their food at the lowest cost in all his-\\ntory. There is no way to prove that the real cost\\nper calorie is the lowest in all history, but we do\\nknow that nearly all people are now devoting a\\nsmaller percentage of their consumption expen-\\nditures to the acquisition of food than was true\\nat times past. As recently as 1955 families in the\\nUnited States allocated 23 percent of their con-\\nsumption expenditure to food; today it is about\\n10 percent. For Japan the reduction was from 54\\nto 20 percent and for South Korea from 50 to 36\\npercent. Between 1960 and 1990 the food share\\nin Thailand declined from 47 to 23 percent\\n(United Nations, National Account Statistics). It\\nis not unreasonable to assume that at the begin-\\nning of the nineteenth century in the developed\\ncountries that 70 percent or more of the con-\\nsumption expenditures went for food and that\\nthe percentage was even higher at the beginning\\nof the twentieth century for the developing\\ncountries. 13\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Economic forecasting models\\nhave been seriously off track and growth pro-\\njections have been revised to reflect a more\\nsanguine outlook only recently.! It is not sur-\\nprising that the unusual combination of more\\nrapid growth and slower inflation in the 1990\\'s\\nhas touched off a strenuous debate among econ-\\nomists about whether improvements in Ameri-\\nca\\'s economic performance can be sustained.\\nThe starting point for the economic debate is\\nthe thesis that the 1990\\'s are a mirror image of\\nthe 1970\\'s, when an unfavorable series of \"sup-\\nply shocks\" led to stagflation-slower growth\\nand higher inflation.2 In this view, the develop-\\nment of information technology (IT) is one of a\\nseries of positive, but temporary, shocks. The\\ncompeting perspective is that IT has produced a\\nfundamental change in the U.S. economy, lead-\\ning to a permanent improvement in growth\\nprospects.\\nThe relentless decline in the prices of informa-\\ntion technology equipment has steadily enhanced\\nthe role of IT investment as a source of American\\neconomic growth. Productivity growth in IT-\\nproducing industries has gradually risen in impor-\\ntance and a productivity revival is now under way\\nin the rest of the economy. Despite differences in\\nmethodology and data sources, a consensus is\\nbuilding that the remarkable behavior of IT prices\\nprovides the key to the surge in economic growth.\\nIn the following section I show that the foun-\\ndation for the American growth resurgence is\\nthe development and deployment of semicon-\\nductors. The decline in IT prices is rooted in\\ndevelopments in semiconductor technology that\\nare widely understood by technologists and\\neconomists. This technology has found its\\nbroadest applications in computing and commu-\\nnications equipment, but has reduced the cost of\\na wide variety of other products.\\nA substantial acceleration in the IT price de-\\ncline occurred in 1995, triggered by a much\\nsharper acceleration in the price decline of\\nsemiconductors in 1994. Although the decline\\nin semiconductor prices has been projected to\\ncontinue for at least another decade, the recent\\nacceleration could be temporary. This can be\\ntraced to a shift in the product cycle for semi-\\nconductors from three years to two years that\\ntook place in 1995 as the consequence of inten-\\nsifying competition in markets for semiconduc-\\ntor products.\\nIn Section II I outline a framework for ana-\\nlyzing the role of information technology in the\\nAmerican growth resurgence. Constant quality\\nprice indexes separate the change in the perfor-\\nmance of IT equipment from the change in price\\nfor a given level of performance. Accurate and\\ntimely computer prices have been part of the\\nU.S. National Income and Product Accounts\\n(NIPA) since 1985. Unfortunately, important\\ninformation gaps remain, especially on trends in\\nprices for closely related investments, such as\\nsoftware and communications equipment.\\nThe cost of capital is an essential concept for\\ncapturing the economic impact of information\\ntechnology prices. Swiftly falling prices provide\\npowerful economic incentives for the substitution\\nof IT equipment for other forms of capital and for\\nlabor services.

I introduce a\\nproduction possibility frontier that encompasses\\nsubstitutions between outputs of consumption\\nand investment goods, as well as inputs of cap-\\nital and labor services. This frontier treats IT\\nequipment as part of investment goods output\\nand the capital services from this equipment as\\na component of capital input.\\nCapital input has been the most important\\nsource of U.S. economic growth throughout the\\npostwar period. More rapid substitution toward\\ninformation technology has given much addi-\\ntional weight to components of capital input\\nwith higher marginal products. The vaulting\\ncontribution of capital input since 1995 has\\nboosted growth by nearly a full percentage\\npoint. The contribution of IT accounts for more\\nthan half of this increase. Computers have been\\nthe predominant impetus to faster growth, but\\ncommunications equipment and software have\\nmade important contributions as well.\\nThe accelerated information technology price\\ndecline signals faster productivity growth in\\nIT-producing industries. In fact, these industries\\nhave been the source of most of aggregate pro-\\nductivity growth throughout the 1990\\'s. Before\\n1995 this was due to the decline of productiv-\\nity growth elsewhere in the economy. The IT-\\nproducing industries have accounted for about\\nhalf the surge in productivity growth since 1995,\\nbut faster growth is not limited to these industries.\\nI conclude that the decline in IT prices will\\ncontinue for some time. This will provide in-\\ncentives for the ongoing substitution of IT for\\nother productive inputs. Falling IT prices also\\nserve as an indicator of rapid productivity\\ngrowth in IT-producing industries. However, it\\nwould be premature to extrapolate the recent\\nacceleration in productivity growth in these in-\\ndustries into the indefinite future, since this de-\\npends on the persistence of a two-year product\\ncycle for semiconductors.\\nIn Section IV I outline research opportunities\\ncreated by the development and diffusion of\\ninformation technology. A voluminous and rap-\\nidly expanding business literature is testimony\\nto the massive impact of IT on firms and prod-\\nuct markets. Highest priority must be given to a\\nbetter understanding of the markets for semi-\\nconductors.

For capital markets the relationship\\nbetween equity valuations and growth prospects\\nmerits much further study. For labor markets\\nmore research is needed on investment in infor-\\nmation technology and substitution among dif-\\nferent types of labor.\\nI.

A mantra of the\\n\"new economy\"-faster, better, cheaper-cap-\\ntures the speed of technological change and\\nproduct improvement in semiconductors and\\nthe precipitous and continuing fall in semicon-\\nductor prices. The price decline has been trans-\\nmitted to the prices of products that rely heavily\\non semiconductor technology, like computers\\nand telecommunications equipment. This tech-\\nnology has also helped to reduce the cost of\\naircraft, automobiles, scientific instruments, and\\na host of other products.\\nModem information technology begins with\\nthe invention of the transistor, a semiconductor\\ndevice that acts as an electrical switch and en-\\ncodes information in binary form.

The challenge is to separate ob-\\nserved price changes between changes in semi-\\nconductor performance and changes in price\\nthat hold performance constant. Achieving this\\nobjective has required a detailed understanding\\nof the technology, the development of sophisti-\\ncated measurement techniques, and the intro-\\nduction of novel methods for assembling the\\nrequisite information.\\nEllen R. Dulberger (1993) of IBM introduced\\na \"matched model\" index for semiconductor\\nprices. A matched model index combines price\\nrelatives for products with the same perfor-\\nmance at different points of time. Dulberger\\npresented constant quality price indexes based\\non index number formulas, including the\\n[Irving] Fisher (1922) ideal index used in the\\nU.S. national accounts. 1 1 The Fisher index is the\\ngeometric average of the familiar Laspeyres and\\nPaasche indexes.\\nW. Erwin Diewert (1976) defined a superla-\\ntive index number as an index that exactly\\nreplicates aflexible representation of the under-\\nlying technology (or preferences). A flexible\\nrepresentation provides a second-order approx-\\nimation to an arbitrary technology (or prefer-\\nences). A. A. Konus and S. S. Byushgens\\n(1926) first showed that the Fisher ideal index is\\nsuperlative in this sense. Laspeyres and Paasche\\nindexes are not superlative and fail to capture\\nsubstitutions among products in response to\\nprice changes accurately.\\nGrimm (1998) combined matched model\\ntechniques with hedonic methods, based on an\\neconometric model of semiconductor prices at\\ndifferent points of time. A hedonic model gives\\nthe price of a semiconductor product as a func-\\ntion of the characteristics that determine perfor-\\nmance, such as speed of processing and storage\\ncapacity. A constant quality price index isolates\\nthe price change by holding these characteristics\\nof semiconductors fixed.\\nBeginning in 1997, the U.S. Bureau of Labor\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Semi-\\nconductor prices reported in the PPI prior to\\n1997 do not hold quality constant, failing to\\ncapture the rapid semiconductor price decline\\nand the acceleration in 1994.\\nD. Computers\\nThe introduction of the Personal Computer\\n(PC) by IBM in 1981 was a watershed event\\nin the deployment of information technology.\\nThe sale of Intel's 8086-8088 microprocessor\\nto IBM in 1978 for incorporation into the PC\\nwas a major business breakthrough for In-\\ntel. 12 In 1981 IBM licensed the MS-DOS\\noperating system from the Microsoft Corpo-\\nration, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen\\nin 1975. The PC established an Intel/\\nMicrosoft relationship that has continued up\\nto the present. In 1985 Microsoft released the\\nfirst version of Windows, its signature oper-\\nating system for the PC, giving rise to the\\nWintel (Windows-Intel) nomenclature for this\\nongoing collaboration.\\nMainframe computers, as well as PC's, have\\ncome to rely heavily on logic chips for central\\nprocessing and memory chips for main mem-\\nory. However, semiconductors account for less\\nthan half of computer costs and computer prices\\nhave fallen much less rapidly than semiconduc-\\ntor prices. Precise measures of computer prices\\nthat hold product quality constant were intro-\\nduced into the NIPA in 1985 and the PPI during\\nthe 1990's. The national accounts now rely on\\nPPI data, but historical data on computers from\\nthe PPI, like the PPI data on semiconductors, do\\nnot hold quality constant.\\nGregory C. Chow (1967) pioneered the use of\\nhedonic techniques for constructing a constant\\nquality index of computer prices in research\\nconducted at IBM. Chow documented price de-\\nclines at more than 20 percent per year during\\n1960-1965, providing an initial glimpse of the\\nn'k ~~~~~~~~~13\\nremarkable behavior of computer prices. In\\n1985 the Bureau of Economic Analysis incor-\\nporated constant quality price indexes for com-\\nputers and peripheral equipment constructed by\\nRosanne Cole et al. (1986) of IBM into the\\nNIPA. Triplett (1986) discussed the economic\\ninterpretation of these indexes, bringing the\\nrapid decline of computer prices to the attention\\nof a very broad audience.\\nThe BEA-IBM constant quality price index\\nfor computers provoked a heated exchange be-\\ntween BEA and Edward F. Denison (1989), one\\nof the founders of national accounting method-\\nology in the 1950's and head of the national\\naccounts at BEA from 1979 to 1982. Denison\\nsharply attacked the BEA-IBM methodology\\nand argued vigorously against the introduction\\nof constant quality price indexes into the na-\\ntional accounts.14 Allan Young (1989), then Di-\\nrector of BEA, reiterated BEA's rationale for\\nintroducing constant quality price indexes.\\nDulberger (1989) presented a more detailed\\nreport on her research on the prices of computer\\nprocessors for the BEA-IBM project. Speed of\\nprocessing and main memory played central\\nroles in her model. Triplett (1989) provided an\\nexhaustive survey of research on hedonic price\\nindexes for computers. Robert J. Gordon (1989,\\n1990) gave an alternative model of computer\\nprices and identified computers and communi-\\ncations equipment, along with commercial air-\\ncraft, as assets with the highest rates of price\\ndecline.\\nFigure 2 gives BEA's constant quality index\\nof prices of computers and peripheral equip-\\nment and its components, including main-\\nframes, PC's, storage devices, other peripheral\\nequipment, and terminals. The decline in com-\\nputer prices follows the behavior of semicon-\\nductor prices presented in Figure 1, but in much\\nattenuated form. The 1995 acceleration in the\\ncomputer price decline parallels the accelera-\\ntion in the semiconductor price decline that\\nresulted from the changeover from a three-year\\nproduct cycle to a two-year cycle in 1995.\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

The\\neleventh comprehensive revision of the national\\naccounts, released by BEA on October 27,\\n1999, reclassified computer software as invest-\\nment.17 Before this important advance, business\\nexpenditures on software were treated as current\\noutlays, while personal and government expen-\\nditures were treated as purchases of nondurable\\ngoods. Software investment is growing rapidly\\nand is now much more important than invest-\\nment in computer hardware.\\nRobert P.

Research Opportunities\\nThe official price indexes for computers and\\nsemiconductors provide the paradigm for eco-\\nnomic measurement. These indexes capture the\\nsteady decline in IT prices and the recent accel-\\neration in this decline. The official price indexes\\nfor central office switching equipment and pre-\\npackaged software also hold quality constant.\\nBEA and BLS, the leading statistical agencies\\nin price research, have carried out much of the\\nbest work in this area.

Switching and terminal equip-\\nment for voice, data, and video communications\\nhas come to rely on semiconductor technology\\nand the empirical evidence on prices of this\\nequipment reflects this fact. Transmission gear\\nemploys technologies with rates of progress that\\nfar outstrip those of semiconductors. This im-\\nportant gap in our official price statistics can\\nonly be filled by constant quality price indexes\\nfor all types of communications equipment.\\nInvestment in software is more important\\nthan investment in hardware. This was essen-\\ntially invisible until BEA introduced new mea-\\nsures of prepackaged, custom, and own-account\\nsoftware investment into the national accounts\\nin 1999. This is a crucial step in understanding\\nthe role of information technology in the Amer-\\nican economy. Unfortunately, software prices\\nare another statistical blind spot, with only\\nprices of prepackaged software adequately rep-\\nresented in the official system of price statistics.\\nThe daunting challenge that lies ahead is to\\nconstruct constant quality price indexes for cus-\\ntom and own-account software.\\nII. The Role of Information Technology\\nAt the aggregate level IT is identified with the\\noutputs of computers, communications equip-\\nment, and software. These products appear in\\nthe GDP as investments by businesses, house-\\nholds, and governments along with net exports\\nto the rest of the world. The GDP also includes\\nthe services of IT products consumed by house-\\nholds and governments. A methodology for an-\\nalyzing economic growth must capture the\\nsubstitution of IT outputs for other outputs of\\ngoods and services.\\nWhile semiconductor technology is the driv-\\ning force behind the spread of IT, the impact of\\nthe relentless decline in semiconductor prices is\\ntransmitted through falling IT prices. Only net\\nexports of semiconductors, defined as the dif-\\nference between U.S. exports to the rest of the\\nworld and U.S. imports, appear in the GDP.\\nSales of semiconductors to domestic manufac-\\nturers of IT products are precisely offset by\\npurchases of semiconductors and are excluded\\nfrom the GDP.\\nConstant quality price indexes, like those re-\\nviewed in the previous section, are a key com-\\nponent of the methodology for analyzing the\\nAmerican growth resurgence. Computer prices\\nwere incorporated into the NIPA in 1985 and\\nare now part of the PPI as well. Much more\\nrecently, semiconductor prices have been in-\\ncluded in the NIPA and the PPI.

The cost of capital is\\nmultiplied by the nominal value of IT capital\\nstock to obtain the imputed service flow from IT\\nproducts. In the business sector this accrues as\\ncapital income to the firms that employ these\\nproducts as inputs. In the household and gov-\\nernment sectors the flow of capital income must\\nbe imputed. This same type of imputation is\\nused for housing in the NIPA. The rental value\\nof renter-occupied housing accrues to real es-\\ntate firms as capital income, while the rental\\nvalue of owner-occupied housing is imputed to\\nhouseholds.\\nCurrent dollar GDP in Table 1 is $9.8 tril-\\nlions in 1999, including imputations, and real\\noutput growth averaged 3.46 percent for the\\nperiod 1948-1999.

This includes outputs of invest-\\nment goods in the form of computers, software,\\ncommunications equipment, and non-IT invest-\\nment goods. It also includes outputs of non-IT\\nconsumption goods and services as well as im-\\nputed IT capital service flows from households\\nand governments.\\nThe most striking feature of the data in Table\\n1 is the rapid price decline for computer invest-\\nment, 17.1 percent per year from 1959 to 1995.\\nSince 1995 this decline has almost doubled to\\n32.1 percent per year.

The depreciation rates presented\\nby Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000b) summarize a\\nlarge body of empirical research on the behavior\\nof asset prices.2 A third empirical issue is the\\ndescription of the tax structure for capital in-\\ncome. This depends on the tax laws prevailing\\nat each point of time. The resolution of these\\nissues has cleared the way for detailed measure-\\nments of the cost of capital for all assets that\\nappear in the national accounts, including infor-\\nmation technology.27\\nThe definition of capital includes all tangible\\nassets in the U.S. economy, equipment and\\nstructures, as well as consumers' and govern-\\nment durables, land, and inventories. The capi-\\ntal service flows from durable goods employed\\nby households and governments enter measures\\nof both output and input.

The most important differences reflect the\\ninclusion of inventories and land in Table 3.\\nBusiness IT investments, as well as purchases\\nof computers, software, and communications\\nequipment by households and governments,\\nhave grown spectacularly in recent years, but\\nremain relatively small.

This represents the substitution\\ntowards assets with higher marginal products.\\nThe shift toward IT increases the quality of\\ncapital, since computers, software, and commu-\\nnications equipment have relatively high mar-\\nginal products. Capital stock estimates fail to\\naccount for this increase in quality and substan-\\ntially underestimate the impact of IT investment\\non growth.\\nThe growth of capital quality is slightly less\\nthan 20 percent of capital input growth for the\\nperiod 1948-1995. However, improvements in\\ncapital quality have increased steadily in rela-\\ntive importance. These improvements jumped\\nto 44.9 percent of total growth in capital input\\nduring the period 1995-1999, reflecting very\\nrapid restructuring of capital to take advantage\\nof the sharp acceleration in the IT price decline.\\nCapital stock has become progressively less ac-\\ncurate as a measure of capital input and is now\\nseriously deficient.\\nFigure 5 gives the IT capital service flows as\\na share of gross domestic income. The second\\npanel of Table 2 summarizes the growth rates of\\nprices and quantities of capital inputs for 1990-\\n1995 and 1995-1999.

Ho and Jorgenson (2000).28\\nThe distinction between labor input and labor\\nhours is analogous to the distinction between\\ncapital services and capital stock. The growth in\\nlabor quality is the difference between the\\ngrowth in labor input and hours worked.

As shown in\\nTable 2, the growth rate of labor input acceler-\\nated to 2.18 percent for 1995-1999 from 1.70\\npercent for 1990-1995. This is primarily due to\\nthe growth of hours worked, which rose from\\n1.17 percent for 1990-1995 to 1.98 percent for\\n1995-1999, as labor-force participation in-\\ncreased and unemployment rates plummeted.\\nThe growth of labor quality has declined con-\\nsiderably in the late 1990's, dropping from 0.53\\npercent for 1990-1995 to 0.20 percent for\\n1995-1999. This slowdown captures well-\\nknown demographic trends in the composition\\nof the workforce, as well as exhaustion of the\\npool of available workers.

An important advantage of\\nthis framework is that prices of IT outputs and\\ninputs are linked through the price of IT cap-\\nital services. This framework successfully\\ncaptures the substitutions among outputs and\\ninputs in response to the rapid deployment of\\nIT. It also encompasses costs of adjustment,\\nwhile allowing financial markets to be mod-\\neled independently.\\nAs a consequence of the swift advance of\\ninformation technology, a number of the most\\nfamiliar concepts in growth economics have\\nbeen superseded. The aggregate production\\nfunction heads this list. Capital stock as a mea-\\nsure of capital input is no longer adequate to\\ncapture the rising importance of IT. This com-\\npletely obscures the restructuring of capital in-\\nput that is such an important wellspring of the\\ngrowth resurgence. Finally, hours worked must\\nbe replaced as a measure of labor input.\\nA. Production Possibility Frontier\\nThe production possibility frontier describes\\nefficient combinations of outputs and inputs for\\nthe economy as a whole.29 Aggregate output Y\\nconsists of outputs of investment goods and\\nconsumption goods. These outputs are pro-\\nduced from aggregate input X, consisting of\\ncapital services and labor services. Productivity\\nis a \"Hicks-neutral\" augmentation of aggregate\\ninput.\\nThe production possibility frontier takes the\\nform:\\n(1) Y(In 9 IC , Is, It,9 Cn 9 Cc)\\nwhere the outputs include non-IT investment\\ngoods I,, and investments in computers Ic, soft-\\nware IS\\' and communications equipment It, as\\nwell as non-IT consumption goods and services\\nCn and IT capital services to households and\\ngovernments Cc. Inputs include non-IT capital\\nservices Kn and the services of computers Kc,\\nsoftware Ks, and telecommunications equip-\\nment K, as well as labor input L.30 Totalfactor\\nproductivity (TFP) is denoted by A.\\nThe most important advantage of the produc-\\ntion possibility frontier is the explicit role that it\\nprovides for constant quality prices of IT prod-\\nucts. These are used as deflators for nominal\\nexpenditures on IT investments to obtain the\\nquantities of IT outputs. Investments in IT are\\ncumulated into stocks of IT capital. The flow of\\nIT capital services is an aggregate of these\\nstocks with service prices as weights. Similarly,\\nconstant quality prices of IT capital services are\\nused in deflating the nominal values of con-\\nsumption of these services.\\nAnother important advantage of the production\\npossibility frontier is the incorporation of costs of\\nadjustment. For example, an increase in the output\\nof IT investment goods requires forgoing part of\\nthe output of consumption goods and non-IT in-\\nvestment goods, so that adjusting the rate of in-\\nvestment in IT is costly. However, costs of\\nadjustment are external to the producing unit and\\nare fully reflected in If prices. These prices incor-\\nporate forward-looking expectations of the future\\nprices of If capital services.\\nB. Aggregate Production Function\\nThe aggregate production function employed\\nby Robert M. Solow (1957, 1960) and, more re-\\ncently, by Jeremy Greenwood et al. (1997, 2000),\\nArnold C. Harberger (1998), and Hercowitz\\n(1998) is a competing methodology. The produc-\\ntion function gives a single output as a function of\\ncapital and labor inputs. There is no role for sep-\\narate prices of investment and consumption goods\\nand, hence, no place for constant quality IF price\\nindexes for outputs of IF investment goods.\\nGreenwood et al. employ a price index for\\nconsumption to deflate the output of all\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " \"investment goods, including information tech-\\nnology. Confronted by the fact that constant\\nquality prices of investment goods differ from\\nconsumption goods prices, they borrow the con-\\ncept of embodiment from Solow (1960) in order\\nto convert investment goods output into an ap-\\npropriate form for measuring capital stock.31\\nInvestment has two prices, one used in the mea-\\nsuring output and the other used in measuring\\ncapital stock. This inconsistency can be re-\\nmoved by simply distinguishing between out-\\nputs of consumption and investment goods, as\\nin the national accounts and equation (1). The\\nconcept of embodiment can then be dropped.\\nPerhaps inadvertently, Greenwood et al. have\\nrevisited the controversy accompanying the in-\\ntroduction of a constant quality price index for\\ncomputers into the national accounts. They have\\nrevived Denison's (1993) proposal to use a con-\\nsumption price index to deflate investment in\\nthe NIPA. Denison found this appealing as a\\nmeans of avoiding the introduction of constant\\nquality price indexes for computers. Denison's\\napproach leads to a serious underestimate of\\nGDP growth and an overestimate of inflation.\\nAnother limitation of the aggregate produc-\\ntion function is that it fails to incorporate costs\\nof adjustment. Robert E. Lucas, Jr. (1967) pre-\\nsented a production model with internal costs of\\nadjustment. Fumio Hayashi (2000) shows how\\nto identify these adjustment costs from James\\nTobin's (1969) Q-ratio, the ratio of the stock\\nmarket value of the producing unit to the market\\nvalue of the unit's assets. Implementation of\\nthis approach requires simultaneous modeling\\nof production and asset valuation. If costs of\\nadjustment are external, as in the production\\npossibility frontier (1), asset valuation can be\\nmodeled separately from production.32\\nC.

The contribution of\\nTFP, the growth rate of the augmentation factor\\nA in equation (2), is the difference between\\ngrowth rates of output and input.\\nTable 6 presents results of a growth account-\\ning decomposition, based on equation (2), for\\nthe period 1948-1999 and various subperiods,\\nfollowing Jorgenson and Stiroh (1999, 2000b).\\nEconomic growth is broken down by output and\\ninput categories, quantifying the contribution of\\ninformation technology to investment and con-\\nsumption outputs, as well as capital inputs.\\nThese estimates identify computers, software,\\nand communications equipment as distinct\\ntypes of information technology.\\nRearranging equation (2), the results can be\\npresented in terms of average labor productiv-\\nity (ALP), defined as y = YIH, the ratio of\\noutput Y to hours worked H, and k = KIH is\\nthe ratio of capital services K to hours worked:\\n(3) A Iny== VKA Ink\\n+ VL(A InL - A In H) + A In A.\\n\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

The third is TFP\\ngrowth, which contributes point-for-point to\\nALP growth.\\nD. Contributions of IT Investment\\nFigure 5 depicts the rapid increase in the\\nimportance of IT services, reflecting the accel-\\nerating pace of IT price declines. In 1995-1999\\nthe capital service price for computers fell 24.81\\npercent per year, compared to an increase of\\n36.36 percent in capital input from computers.\\nAs a consequence, the value of computer ser-\\nvices grew substantially. However, the current\\ndollar value of computers was only 1.6 percent\\nof gross domestic income in 1999.\\nThe rapid accumulation of software appears\\nto have different sources. The price of software\\nservices has declined only 2.04 percent per year\\nfor 1995-1999. Nonetheless, firms have been\\naccumulating software very rapidly, with real\\ncapital services growing 16.30 percent per year.\\nA possible explanation is that firms respond to\\ncomputer price declines by investing in comple-\\nmentary inputs like software. However, a more\\nplausible explanation is that the price indexes\\nused to deflate software investment fail to hold\\nquality constant. This leads to an overstatement\\nof inflation and an understatement of growth.\\nAlthough the price decline for communica-\\ntions equipment during the period 1995-1999 is\\ncomparable to that of software, investment in\\nthis equipment is more in line with prices. How-\\never, prices of communications equipment also\\nfail to hold quality constant. The technology of\\nswitching equipment, for example, is similar to\\nthat of computers; investment in this category is\\ndeflated by a constant-quality price index devel-\\noped by BEA. Conventional price deflators are\\nemployed for transmission gear, such as fiber-\\noptic cables. This leads to an underestimate of\\nthe growth rates of investment, capital stock,\\ncapital services, and the GDP, as well as an\\noverestimate of the rate of inflation.\\nFigures 6 and 7 highlight the rising contribu-\\ntions IT outputs to U.S. economic growth.

Firms, consumers, govern-\\nments, and purchasers of U.S. exports are re-\\nsponding to relative price changes, increasing\\nthe contributions of computers, software, and\\ncommunications equipment.\\nTable 2 shows that the price of computer\\ninvestment fell by more than 32 percent per\\nyear, the price of software 2.4 percent, the price\\nof communications equipment 2.9 percent, and\\nthe price of IT services 11.8 percent during the\\nperiod 1995-1999, while non-IT prices rose 2.2\\npercent. In response to these price changes,\\nfirms, households, and governments have accu-\\nmulated computers, software, and communica-\\ntions equipment much more rapidly than other\\nforms of capital.\\nE. Total Factor Productivity\\nThe price or \"dual\" approach to productivity\\nmeasurement makes it possible to identify the\\nrole of IT production as a source of productivity\\ngrowth at the industry level.34 The rate of pro-\\nductivity growth is measured as the decline in\\nthe price of output, plus a weighted average of\\nthe growth rates of input prices with value\\nshares of the inputs as weights. For the com-\\nputer industry this expression is dominated by\\ntwo terms: the decline in the price of computers\\nand the contribution of the price of semiconduc-\\ntors. For the semiconductor industry the expres-\\nsion is dominated by the decline in the price of\\nsemiconductors.35\\nJorgenson et al. (1987) have employed\\nDomar\\'s (1961) model to trace aggregate pro-\\nductivity growth to its sources at the level of\\nindividual industries.36 More recently, Har-\\nberger (1998), William Gullickson and Michael\\nJ. Harper (1999), and Jorgenson and Stiroh\\n(2000a, 2000b) have used the model for similar\\npurposes. Productivity growth for each industry\\nis weighted by the ratio of the gross output of\\nthe industry to GDP to estimate the industry\\ncontribution to aggregate TFP growth.\\nIf semiconductor output were only used to\\nproduce computers, then its contribution to\\ncomputer-industry productivity growth, weighted\\nby computer-industry output, would precisely\\ncancel its independent contribution to aggregate\\nTFP growth. This is the ratio of the value of\\nsemiconductor output to GDP, multiplied by the\\nrate of semiconductor price decline. In fact, semi-\\nconductors are used to produce telecommunica-\\ntions equipment and many other products.\\nHowever, the value of semiconductor output is\\ndominated by inputs into IT production.\\nThe Domar aggregation folmula can be approx-\\nimated by expressing the declines in prices of\\ncomputers, communications equipment, and soft-\\nware relative to the price of gross domestic in-\\ncome, an aggregate of the prices of capital and\\nlabor services. The rates of relative IT price de-\\ncline are weighted by ratios of the outputs of IT\\nproducts to the GDP. Table 7 reports details of this\\nTFP decomposition for 1948-1999; the IT and\\nnon-IT contributions are presented in Figure\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

This re-\\nflects the accelerating decline in relative price\\nchanges resulting from shortening the product cy-\\ncle for semiconductors.\\nF. Output Growth\\nThis subsection presents the sources of GDP\\ngrowth for the entire period 1948 to 1999. Cap-\\nital services contribute 1.70 percentage points,\\nlabor services 1.14 percentage points, and TFP\\ngrowth only 0.61 percentage points. Input\\ngrowth is the source of nearly 82.3 percent of\\nU.S. growth over the past half century, while\\nTFP has accounted for 17.7 percent. Figure\\n11 shows the relatively modest contributions of\\nTFP in all subperiods.\\nMore than three-quarters of the contribution\\nof capital reflects the accumulation of capital\\nstock, while improvement in the quality of cap-\\nital accounts for about one-quarter. Similarly,\\nincreased labor hours account for 80 percent of\\nlabor's contribution; the remainder is due to\\nimprovements in labor quality. Substitutions\\namong capital and labor inputs in response to\\nprice changes are essential components of the\\nsources of economic growth.\\nA look at the U.S. economy before and after\\n1973 reveals familiar features of the historical\\nrecord. After strong output and TFP growth in\\nthe 1950's, 1960's, and early 1970's, the U.S.\\neconomy slowed markedly through 1990, with\\noutput growth falling from 3.99 percent to 2.86\\npercent and TFP growth declining from 0.92\\npercent to 0.25 percent. Growth in capital inputs\\nalso slowed from 4.64 percent for 1948-1973 to\\n3.57 percent for 1973-1990. This contributed to\\nsluggish ALP growth-2.82 percent for 1948-\\n1973 and 1.26 percent for 1973-1990.\\nRelative to the early 1990's, output growth in-\\ncreased by 1.72 percent in 1995-1999. The con-\\ntribution of IT production almost doubled, relative\\nto 1990-1995, but still accounted for only 28.9\\npercent of the increased growth of output. Al-\\nthough the contribution of IT has increased\\nsteadily throughout the period 1948-1999, there\\nhas been a sharp response to the acceleration in the\\nIT price decline in 1995. Nonetheless, more than\\n70 percent of the increased output growth can be\\nattributed to non-IT products.\\nBetween 1990-1995 and 1995-1999 the con-\\ntribution of capital input jumped by 0.95\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

The contribution of capital, predom-\\ninantly IT, is considerably more important than\\nthe contribution of labor. The contribution of IT\\ncapital services has grown steadily throughout\\nthe period 1948-1999, but Figure 9 reflects the\\nimpact of the accelerating decline in IT prices.\\nAfter maintaining an average rate of 0.25 per-\\ncent for the period 1973-1990, TFP growth fell to\\n0.24 percent for 1990-1995 and then vaulted to\\n0.75 percent per year for 1995-1999.

While TFP\\ngrowth for 1995-1999 is lower than the rate of\\n1948-1973, the U.S. economy is recuperating\\nfrom the anemic productivity growth of the past\\ntwo decades. Although only half of the accelera-\\ntion in TFP from 1990-1995 to 1995-1999 can be\\nattributed to IT production, this is far greater than\\nthe 4.26 percent share of IT in the GDP.\\nG. Average Labor Productivity\\nOutput growth is the sum of growth in hours\\nand average labor productivity. Table 8 shows\\nthe breakdown between growth in hours and\\nALP for the same periods as in Table 6. For the\\nperiod 1948-1999, ALP growth predominated\\nin output growth, increasing just over 2 percent\\nper year for 1948-1999, while hours increased\\nabout 1.4 percent per year.

Economics on Internet Time\\nThe steadily rising importance of information\\ntechnology has created new research opportuni-\\nties in all areas of economics.

The Solow (1987) Paradox,\\nthat we see computers everywhere but in the\\nproductivity statistics,42 has provided a point of\\ndeparture. Since computers have now left an\\nindelible imprint on the productivity statistics,\\nthe remaining issue is: Does the breathtaking\\nspeed of technological change in semiconduc-\\ntors differentiate this resurgence from previous\\nperiods of rapid growth?\\nCapital and labor markets have been severely\\nimpacted by information technology. Enormous\\nuncertainty surrounds the relationship between\\nequity valuations and future growth prospects\\nof the American economy.43 One theory at-\\ntributes rising valuations of equities since the\\ngrowth acceleration began in 1995 to the accu-\\nmulation of intangible assets, such as intellec-\\ntual property and organizational capital. An\\nalternative theory treats the high valuations of\\ntechnology stocks as a bubble that burst during\\nthe year 2000.\\nThe behavior of labor markets also poses\\nimportant puzzles. Widening wage differentials\\nbetween workers with more and less education\\nhas been attributed to computerization of the\\nworkplace. A possible explanation could be that\\nhigh-skilled workers are complementary to IT,\\nwhile low-skilled workers are substitutable. An\\nalternative explanation is that technical change\\nassociated with IT is skill biased and increases\\nthe wages of high-skilled workers relative to\\nlow-skilled workers.44\\nFinally, information technology is altering\\nproduct markets and business organizations, as\\nattested by the large and growing business lit-\\nerature,45 but a fully satisfactory model of the\\nsemiconductor industry remains to be devel-\\noped.46 Such a model would derive the demand\\nfor semiconductors from investment in informa-\\ntion technology in response to rapidly falling IT\\nprices. An important objective is to determine\\nthe product cycle for successive generations of\\nnew semiconductors endogenously.\\nThe semiconductor industry and the informa-\\ntion technology industries are global in their\\nscope with an elaborate international division of\\nlabor.47 This poses important questions about\\nthe American growth resurgence. Where is the\\nevidence of a new economy in other leading\\nindustrialized countries? An important explana-\\ntion is the absence of constant quality price\\nindexes for semiconductors and information\\ntechnology in national accounting systems out-\\nside the U.S.48 Another conundrum is that\\nseveral important participants-Korea, Malay-\\nsia, Singapore, and Taiwan-are \"newly indus-\\ntrializing\" economies.

In pro-\\nduction activities, work is organized in highly\\nspecialized ways to use our human resources to\\nthe fullest.\\nAll this is so elementary that economists\\nlargely take it for granted, yet much of the\\ncomplexity of modem economic life is built\\nupon these foundations. The variety of choices\\nthat confront us is astonishing. No consumer\\nbuys more than a tiny fraction of goods that are\\navailable to be purchased.

Thinking spatially proves es-\\npecially useful when there are many more\\nvarieties of goods than attributes that each con-\\ntains. Because there are fewer attributes than\\ngoods, the dimensionality of the problem is\\ngreatly reduced and analysis can proceed on\\nconventional cost-benefit terms.\\nExamples of applications include hedonic in-\\ndexes of quality change needed to correct price\\nindexes for changing product characteristics;\\namong such products as automobiles and com-\\nputers; regression analysis of housing prices on\\nhouse characteristics, used for real estate assess-\\nments in urban economics; the capital asset\\npricing model, where asset characteristics are\\nthe means and covariances of their rate of return\\ndistributions; studying how labor markets eval-\\nuate jobs of varying quality, useful for estimat-\\ning the social value of safety and environmental\\ngoods that are not directly traded; and how and\\nwhy labor markets sustain enormous differ-\\nences in rewards and rents among people of\\ndifferent talents. All are manifestations of al-\\nmost exactly the same basic spatial problem:\\nvaluing diversity.\\nMarket values are an important part of the\\nstory. The allocation of diversity in the econ-\\nomy is another. How are buyers and sellers\\nmatched or assigned to each other in market\\nequilibrium? These marriage-type questions\\nbear importantly on the economic consequences\\nof diversity because stratification of agents is\\ninherent in spatial equilibrium. Certain kinds of\\nbuyers come to be associated with certain kinds\\nof sellers, even when there are no externalities\\nand social influences in preferences. Rich peo-\\nple tend to ride in a better class of automobiles\\nthan poor people. They are more likely to live\\non the lakeshore and in other high-rent districts,\\nto eat in fancy restaurants, wear designer\\nclothes, send their children to better schools,\\nand work in more pleasant environments. But\\nthere are many other manifestations of the same\\nbasic sorting or assignment issues in the pres-\\nence of diversity. Widows and orphans tend to\\nhold their wealth in relatively safe assets. Peo-\\nple from similar ethnic groups tend to live to-\\ngether in city enclaves, more talented students\\nare apt to be found in colleges and graduate\\nschools that have more talented teachers,\\nhigher-quality lawyers work on the largest legal\\nclaims, and people exposed to higher unem-\\nployment risks tend to live in the same\\nneighborhoods.\\nThe address analogy in spatial equilibrium\\noften extends to these kinds of matches or as-\\nsignments: goods with special attributes appeal\\nto buyers with specific kinds of tastes. In prod-\\nuct markets, sellers design their goods to cater\\nto specific types of customers. And in labor\\nmarkets, each of us in our career choices and\\nwork activities seeks a niche in the incredibly\\ncomplex machinery of modern production and\\nthe division of labor. The number of people\\nseeking these slots and the nature of the tech-\\nnologies that affect the personal scale of oper-\\nations affects the distribution of rewards in\\nsociety.\\nMarkets accommodate diversity by establish-\\ning prices that tend to make different things\\nrelatively close substitutes at the margin. Adam\\nSmith's insight that market prices tend to equal-\\nize their net advantages is fundamental to these\\nproblems. If one good has more desirable char-\\nacteristics than another, the less preferred vari-\\nety must compensate for its disadvantages by\\nselling at a lower price. Supply is inelastic and\\nexogenous in geographic spatial theory, but in\\nmany applications both sides of the market must\\nbe considered jointly. Sellers choose their vari-\\neties by comparing prices with costs. Higher-\\nquality goods are more costly to produce and\\nmust be offered at a higher price. In equilibrium\\nthese extra costs can only be supported if their\\nincremental value to some customers is at least\\nas large as their incremental costs. Thus diver-\\nsity creates inequality in prices and values. The\\nreverse statement is also true. Certain kinds of\\ninequality are necessary to sustain diverse out-\\ncomes. For example, if higher-quality goods\\nwere not more expensive to produce than lower-\\nquality ones and if all consumers had the same\\nrelative ranking on the quality of two different\\ngoods, then only the higher-quality good would\\nsurvive in the market. The lower-quality good is\\ndriven out by the existence of a superior one\\nthat can be produced at equal cost.\\nWhat is less obvious is that there are social\\nincentives to create inequality, even when\\nagents are initially identical in every conceiv-\\nable way. This is a third theme of the essay. The\\nbasic idea also derives from Smith, who argued\\nthat personal investments in skill acquisition,\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

Since labor-market skills are costly to learn,\\nin market equilibrium their costs must be reim-\\nbursed by offering larger expected earnings to\\npotential entrants, otherwise students would not\\nhave the proper economic incentives to study\\nthem. Since much of the cost of education and\\nlearning are in time and opportunities forgone,\\nthe force of interest weighs heavily in these\\ndecisions and can cause remarkably large dif-\\nferences in observed earnings, as equilibrium\\nphenomena.\\nBut once a skill has been acquired, its eco-\\nnomic return is greatest if it is used as inten-\\nsively as possible. That the costs of acquiring\\nmost skills are to some extent independent of\\nhow intensively they are utilized makes it effi-\\ncient for people to specialize their skills and\\ntrade with each other. There are huge econo-\\nmies of scale in skills. Once acquired, a skill can\\nbe used over and over again without diminish-\\ning its stock. Indeed, the reverse may be true,\\nwhich provides incentives for students to ac-\\nquire skills early and to increase their work\\nhours after having become skilled.\\nFurthermore, individuals have different tal-\\nents and are better suited to some productive\\nactivities than others.

Unequal rewards motivate people to\\nstrive for superior performance and influence\\ntheir decisions to acquire skills. The two inter-\\nact because new generations of workers replace\\nolder generations: the assignment of people to\\njobs changes over the life cycle.

Uncertainty of\\noutcomes and the statistical aspects of promo-\\ntion and job assignments guarantee that compe-\\ntition for superior positions occurs in every\\nform of economic organization. The need to use\\nthe record of past performance to assess pros-\\npects for other positions automatically gives\\npeople incentives to try to influence the mea-\\nsures that will put them in a superior category.\\nThe strength of these incentives depends on\\nhow much of a difference-in money, prestige\\nand perquisites-it makes to achieve a better\\ngrade and a higher classification.\\nII. Valuing Diversity\\nMuch of my research consists of applications\\nof the problem of analyzing markets for differ-\\nentiated products when the measure of differen-\\ntiation is naturally ordered from best to worst.\\nMarket prices reflect both the costs and values\\nof the underlying attributes of goods. Agents\\nimplicitly use cost-benefit analysis to choose\\nlocations in the product spectrum, with buyers\\ncomparing the market prices of alternative va-\\nrieties with their relative values in use and with\\nsellers comparing market prices with their rel-\\native costs. Equality between demand and sup-\\nply for each variety sustains the market\\nequilibrium price-quality structure.\\nConsider a commodity that comes in two\\ndifferent varieties. For example, there are high-\\nand low-quality cars, better and worse houses\\n(or schools or neighborhoods), good jobs and\\nbad ones, fast and slow computers, and so on.\\nLet c represent all other goods consumed and let\\nZh and z1 measure the high- and low-quality\\ncharacteristics of the goods in question. The\\nrelative prices of the two varieties in terms of\\nother goods are Ph and Pl In the situation con-\\nsidered, which is typical of many markets, in-\\ndividual buyers and sellers are small compared\\nto the overall market and individually have no\\nmarket power. Suppose that customers purchase\\neither one unit of the differentiated product or\\nnone. This is a leading case. Most people live in\\nexactly one neighborhood, hold one job, and\\ndrive one car.

High-quality goods must sell for\\nhigher prices than low-quality goods, or else\\nlow quality is dominated and disappears from\\nthe market. Thus, higher z is always associated\\nwith larger p if both Zh and z, are actually\\ntraded. Given that some variety is purchased, a\\nconsumer chooses Zh if the benefits of its addi-\\ntional quality exceed its additional cost.

Analogously, those whose tastes look like\\n01 purchase z, and those whose tastes are more\\nlike 02 buy Zh- Choices of differentiated variet-\\nies are nicely ordered by the intensity of pref-\\nerences for quality in this example.\\nSupply decisions of sellers are similar. The\\nbenefit of selling a variety is its market price.\\nProduction is profitable if price exceeds produc-\\ntion costs of at least some sellers. Parallel with\\nbid functions, these choices are depicted by a\\nspatial offer function p( z)-the locus of price-\\nquality pairs that result in the same profit. \\'p( c)\\nis the supply price of quality z for that seller.\\nSince higher-quality goods are more costly to\\nproduce, \\'p\\'(z) > 0. Offer curves are increas-\\ning and convex functions of z.

Production activ-\\nities in which workers directly interact require\\npersonnel who complement each other's per-\\nsonal productivity and efficiency characteris-\\ntics. Because of direct complementarity in most\\nproduction settings, more interpersonal varia-\\ntion in efficiency within production units can be\\ntolerated by transacting through the market\\nrather than directly in teams.

Neither seller has any incentive to try to\\nsell to consumers of the other type, nor does any\\nbuyer have any incentive to purchase from the\\nother type of seller. All four types of agents can\\ndo no better, given the opportunities available.\\nA. Interpreting the Implicit Value of\\nCharacteristics\\nEmpirical investigations of product and labor\\ndifferentiation use cross-section data to relate\\nprices p with attributes z. The hedonic regres-\\nsion method regresses product prices on product\\ncharacteristics. It was initially developed to\\nstudy real cost reductions in auto and other\\ndurable goods manufacturing that were con-\\ncealed by product design changes and quality\\nimprovements. In labor economics, wages of\\nworkers are regressed on their personal produc-\\ntivity and job characteristics. In land and hous-\\ning markets, site and structure prices are\\nregressed on house attributes (size, architectural\\nstyle, and age) and onsite characteristics (neigh-\\nborhood, location, and public services). Labor\\nand land market studies are useful for imputing\\nthe social value of certain intangible goods, like\\nsafety and clean environments. An important\\nuse in goods markets is to construct price and\\nquantity indexes that control for changes in the\\nquality of goods over time.\\nB. Cross-Section Values\\nEnvironmental and safety concerns are at the\\nforefront of public policy today. The rhetoric\\nand passions they arouse make it easy to forget\\nthat these goods are costly to produce and that\\nrational decisions require comparing their ben-\\nefits with their costs. Assessing the costs of\\nthese kinds of public policies is like finding the\\ncosts of any other investment. Assessing bene-\\nfits requires estimating the willingness of con-\\nsumers to pay for more safety and better\\nenvironments. Practice is tricky because there\\nexist no explicit markets where safety and clean\\nair are directly traded, and from which demand\\nvalues can be directly inferred. Instead, safety\\nand environmental quality often are by-products\\nof other transactions and their valuations must\\nbe imputed from the observed packages in\\nwhich they play a part.\\nExposure to risk and pollution are affected by\\nwork and residential choices.

Private cost-benefit consider-\\nations underlying such choices are the basis for\\nimputing the required values. Housing in crime-\\nfree neighborhoods is expensive because people\\nare willing to pay more for greater personal\\nsafety and protection of their property and be-\\ncause crime-free neighborhoods are scarce.\\nWages on hazardous jobs must be higher in\\norder to induce workers to expose themselves to\\ngreater risk of life and limb. Observed price\\ndifferences across jobs and locations are the\\nimplicit prices of characteristics, as in Figure\\n1, with z interpreted as job safety or neighbor-\\nhood safety.\\nValuations generally vary among agents.\\nPeople with different tastes and incomes have\\ndifferent bid and offer functions, but more is\\ninvolved. In most types of economic exchange,\\nthe Law of One Price implies that marginal\\nvaluations across buyers are identical and that\\ndifferences in tastes manifest themselves only in\\ndifferences in quantities consumed. For exam-\\nple, the \"last\" loaf of bread is worth about the\\nsame-its market price-to a person who con-\\nsumes one loaf per week as to a person who\\nbuys one loaf per day.\\nThe Law of One Price always applies to the\\nspecific houses, jobs, or goods markets that\\nembody intangible characteristics, but not nec-\\nessarily to the intangible characteristics them-\\nselves. Whether there is a unique market price\\nof a characteristic depends on whether or not the\\ncharacteristics embodied in existing varieties\\ncan be recombined or remanufactured by buyers\\ninto different varieties. The leading example of\\nsuch \"combinability\" is asset and portfolio\\nmanagement. Risk and return of any single asset\\nare relevant only insofar as they affect the risk\\nand return on one\\'s total portfolio. A portfolio is\\na linear combination of various assets, so co-\\nvariance of risk on one asset compared to others\\nis the key risk component. The implied linear\\nrestrictions (or no-arbitrage conditions) imply a\\nunique market price for risk.\\nBut the fact is that combinability of charac-\\nteristics across varieties is not possible for most\\nother goods. If it is expensive to untie bundles\\nafter they have been manufactured, sellers must\\ndesign their goods for specific tastes and assem-\\nble packages of characteristics that appeal to\\nspecific market segments. This generally results\\nin differing attribute prices across packages.\\nOne cannot buy another unit of comfort for a\\nsports car in an independent \"comfort\" market.\\nInstead, a larger car must be purchased. A\\nworker on a risky job cannot subcontract little\\nbits of the risk to others in a secondary market.\\nIt is all-or-nothing. The only way less risk can\\nbe chosen is by finding a safer job. Workers\\ncome prepackaged with various combinations\\nof skills and traits, some productive and others\\ncounterproductive. Employers cannot detach\\nthe less desirable ones from any single worker.\\nRather, an entirely different person has to be\\nhired. In these cases the market equilibrium\\nprice function p( z) usually is nonlinear, and the\\ngradient p\\'(z) generally depends on z itself.\\nSince there is no single market price for z,\\ndifferent people have different valuations of it at\\nthe margin. Type 0\\' and 02 buyers in Figure\\n1 serve as an example. In principle an average\\nof the two slopes at z1 and Zh is appropriate for\\nassessing the (marginal) benefits of a small in-\\ndependent public project affecting z in some\\napplication, with the average weighted by ben-\\nefit incidence of the project among different\\ntypes of people.\\nSo many factors determine market prices of\\ngoods in practice that the best chance empiri-\\ncally for isolating the implicit value of safety\\nand environment is to examine specific goods or\\njobs where these aspects dominate other consid-\\nerations of choice. For instance, my labor-\\nmarket study with Richard Thaler (1 976) on the\\nvalue of life was one of the first to systemati-\\ncally examine wage premiums on very risky\\njobs, where risk was measured as excess insur-\\nance premiums charged by private companies\\non worker compensation policies.\\nThe revealed preference argument in Figure\\n1 applies directly to that problem. Here z rep-\\nresents job safety and p( z) is estimated by\\nstatistically comparing the smaller market wage\\nthat workers are paid on safer jobs compared to\\nhigher wages paid on riskier ones, other things\\nequal. Examining risky jobs empirically con-\\nfines the study to jobs with relatively low values\\nof safety, e.g., to those in the neighborhood of z,\\nin the figure. Since most workers hold relatively\\nsafe jobs (located closer to a point like z,, in the\\nfigure), people holding risky jobs surely place\\nsmaller values on safety than the median per-\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

       " 'son, much like the difference between people of\\ntypes 01 and &2 in the figure. Workers choosing\\nsafe jobs are willing to pay at least as much for\\nsafety as people choosing risky jobs, so the\\nwage premium on risky jobs is likely to be a\\nlower bound on the average person\\'s willing-\\nness to pay for safety.\\nThaler and I estimated a \"value of life\" of\\nabout $800,000 in dollars of Year 2000 pur-\\nchasing power. Other labor-market studies us-\\ning data on a wider range of risks have found\\nmuch larger values. The broader range of risks\\nin these studies is the most probable reason\\nfor the larger estimates: they include more\\nbetween-variation (e.g., the differences between\\nz1 and Zh), whereas our study was largely con-\\nfined to within-variation (around zl). Similar\\nconsiderations apply to housing and land mar-\\nket studies that impute values for crime, cli-\\nmate, and pollution. Here, too, revealed\\npreference implies that estimated pollution and\\ncrime gradients are likely to be lower bounds\\nfor the average citizen because they ignore im-\\nportant sorting considerations.\\nC. Time-Series Imputations\\nThe main practical difficulty in assessing\\nchanging standards of living is that goods\\nchange their character over time. The prices of\\ntractors and automobiles today differ from 30\\nyears ago, not only because manufacturing pro-\\nductivity and input prices have changed, but\\nalso because the products themselves have im-\\nproved. The nature of the problem is starkest\\nwhen entirely new goods appear on the market.\\nIf their introduction is successful and they sup-\\nplant older varieties, how should they be linked\\ninto a price index?\\nConceptually, the only possibility is to think\\nin terms of the costs of providing ultimate ser-\\nvices. Technical changes reduce the cost of ser-\\nvices. Autos were successful because they were\\na superior way of producing transport services\\ncompared to animals. Electricity produced heat\\nand light more efficiently than steam and lan-\\ntems, and radio, television, and movies reduced\\nthe cost of entertainment services relative to live\\nperformances. In these examples, technical\\nchanges should be factored into price indexes\\nfor transport services, power, and entertainment\\nservices. In practice it is extremely difficult to\\nlink entirely new goods to old goods in this\\nway. Adjusting for quality improvements of ex-\\nisting goods is more manageable.\\nRising incomes naturally cause product qual-\\nity to improve over time, because the income\\nelasticity of demand for quality is positive.\\nEven when the prices per unit quality of goods\\ndo not change, rising incomes increase the de-\\nmand for quality and raise average transactions\\nprices over time. Offsetting the rise in demand\\nfor quality is that some aspects of quality (like\\nornate detail on early twentieth-century houses)\\nare labor intensive, which causes their prices to\\nrise as incomes rise. As long as the cost factor is\\nnot dominant, there is upward bias in measured\\nprices and downward bias in measured real liv-\\ning standards from a change in the composition\\nof goods toward more expensive varieties.\\nTransactions prices rise not because cost has\\nincreased, but because the quality of what is\\nbeing referred to as a particular good has in-\\ncreased. Income effects are represented by\\nmovements along a given p( z) locus in Figure\\n1. The same envelope of offer functions define\\np(z), but bid functions shift up and to the right\\nas income rises because the willingness to pay\\nfor increments of z increases with income. 01\\nand 0& in Figure 1 could represent two people\\nwith the same underlying utility functions but\\ndifferent incomes. With constant returns to\\nscale in production, prices of each variety do\\nnot change as income rises, but average quality\\npurchased and average transactions prices both\\nincrease. We should not confuse movements\\nalong the p( z) locus with changes in the cost of\\nliving. Most consumption decisions change as\\nincome rises, and these are part and parcel of\\nthe same general phenomenon. Standardized\\ncomparisons that control for the changing com-\\nposition of goods eliminate this kind of bias.\\nTo assess changes in the real costs of living,\\nwe should account for shifts in the price-quality\\nlocus or technological changes that extend the\\nreal range of choice. Such shifts can cause\\nquality-specific prices either to rise or fall. For\\nexample, p( z) and the cost of living go up in the\\nincome-increasing experiment above if goods\\nare supplied inelastically. For example, rising\\nreal incomes increase the demand for amenities\\nassociated with geographic location, raising\\nsite values and the costs of housing services\\nin the preferred locations. On the other hand,\\n\\n\\n###',\n",

Prices and\\navailable qualities are always changing. Some\\nsellers are innovating and attempting to increase\\nprofits by extending the desirable characteristics\\nin their goods and reducing prices below those\\nof competitors. The prototypical example ap-\\npears in Figure 2. The first-period equilibrium is\\nthe same as before, where goods are labeled zll\\nand Zh I and equilibria are found at points A and\\nB. In the second period the attributes of goods\\nhave changed to Z12 and Zh2 so the price-quality\\nlocus has moved down, and the average price\\nper unit quality has declined. (A ray from the\\norigin through A is steeper than one through D\\nand similarly for B and E.) Quality-adjusted\\nprice indexes require measuring the distance\\nbetween the two price-quality loci, shown in\\nFigure 2 as the curve that connects A and B and\\nthe one that connects D and E. The distance\\nbetween F and D is a measure of the quality-\\nadjusted change in price at quality level z,12\\nWhen technical change is so large that z could\\nnot be produced in period 1 (a 32-bit computer\\nchip did not exist in 1980) shown, for example,\\nby Zh2', direct price comparisons of the im-\\nproved product are impossible. In principle this\\ncan be overcome with sufficient structural\\nknowledge of bid functions. In this case, the\\nrequirement amounts to knowing the exact\\nshape of 02( z) and of 02'( z), which represents\\ndifferent indifference curves for the same con-\\nsumer. The conceptually appropriate measure of\\ndistance is the difference between actual price\\nin period 2 and what type 2 buyers would have\\nbeen willing to pay for Zh2' in period 1 had it\\nbeen available, shown in Figure 2 as the dis-\\ntance between G and H. Generally such detailed\\nstructural knowledge is unavailable, so distance\\nmust be measured by using overlapping variet-\\nies whose quality is more or less comparable\\nacross adjacent periods. For example, top-of-\\nthe-line goods in period 1 might be compared\\nwith bottom-of-the-line goods in period 2.\\nLonger period comparisons are made by linking\\nor chaining indexes with common components\\nover the years.\\nFigure 2 contains a graphic example of why\\nthese adjustments are important. Consider a\\nnew good Zh2' not previously available, whose\\ncurrent price, Ph2', exceeds that of the best prior\\nmodels. Unadjusted indexes would show rising\\nprices simply because Ph2' exceeds Ph 1. A more\\naccurate distance-based quality-adjusted index\\nwould correctly show prices declining because\\nconsumers would have been willing to pay more\\nthan its period 2 cost in period 1, had it been\\navailable. Note that there is a consumer whose\\nbid function, in this case 03( z), reflects higher\\nsatisfaction at (Zh2', Ph2') than at any other\\navailable (z, p) combination.\\nThis example is transparent, but very rele-\\nvant. Until a few years ago, the National Income\\nand Product Accounts priced computers by the\\nbox-by the package in which producers deliv-\\nered them. In the early years of the computer\\nrevolution boxes were getting bigger and more\\npowerful, and their prices were increasing. It\\nwas as if soap were suddenly produced in bigger\\nbars and the index used the price per bar, not the\\nprice per unit volume or weight. Computer pro-\\nductivity was grossly distorted in the official\\nindexes, though the aggregate consequences of\\nthe error were limited because investment in\\ncomputers was not such a large share of total\\ninvestment as is true today. But even when box\\nprices were falling, as has been true for many\\nyears, unadjusted price indexes distort produc-\\ntivity.

Sorting and Stratification\\nIn any market equilibrium, interpersonal dif-\\nferences in tastes and technologies affect the\\nlocations chosen by buyers and sellers on the\\nattributes map. Some of these differences are\\ninexplicable: sometimes there really is no ac-\\ncounting for different tastes. Others have more\\nproximate causes, but might just as well be\\nsummarized stochastically. For instance, the\\npreferences for material goods of a person from\\nhumble origins that subsequently makes lots of\\nmoney often seem to differ from those of her\\nchildren. Families that are contemplating hav-\\ning children are likely to prefer larger cars to\\nsmaller ones and suburban to downtown dwell-\\ning units. In the labor market, a person's supply\\nprice for physically demanding or dangerous\\nwork depends on age, physical condition, and\\nnumber of dependents, among other things. Dif-\\nferent endowments affect productivities in dif-\\nferent pursuits. Musicians cannot be tone-deaf;\\nfootball players tend to be large; while lawyers,\\nand many economists, have a propensity to talk.\\nWhat matters for economic allocations in all\\nof these cases are the direct manifestations of\\ntastes. Here, the reservation prices themselves,\\nnot the specific causes that make preferences,\\ndiffer case by case. The distributions of bid and\\noffer functions are sufficient (in the statistical\\nsense) for ascertaining the demand, supply, and\\nequilibrium price of each variety. But when\\nreservation prices are systematically associated\\nwith observable traits of buyers and sellers,\\nthese markets become stratified in many ways.\\nStratification and sorting are ubiquitous in spa-\\ntial equilibrium and have many interesting con-\\nsequences. Neighborhood, bandwagon, status,\\nand other social externalities are often invoked\\nto account for stratification, but most stratifica-\\ntion occurs without them.\\nSorting by income is one of the most impor-\\ntant forms of stratification in goods, land, and\\nlabor markets. As noted above, people who buy\\nhigh-quality goods, and live in better residences\\nand neighborhoods tend to be richer than other\\npeople. Similarly, high-wage people use their\\nhigher earning capacity to purchase more job\\namenities and better working conditions. Strat-\\nification of job quality by the skill characteris-\\ntics of workers can make it difficult to estimate\\nequalizing wage differences for the implicit at-\\ntributes of jobs. Sometimes the data on job and\\nworker characteristics are so colinear that the\\nceteris paribus conditions required for identify-\\ning taste parameters alone are overwhelmed by\\nincome stratification and cannot be observed in\\nthe data. Yet it is incorrect to take this as evi-\\ndence of failure of the equalizing or compensa-\\ntion principle in the labor market.\\nStratification and colinearity is itself an im-\\nplication of the economic theory of preferences\\nwhen income effects are important. High-wage\\njobs generally are the good jobs, not the bad\\nones. They are staffed by skillful workers\\nwhose higher incomes make job amenities more\\nvaluable and who buy more of them. There is no\\nlogical contradiction here. The identifying re-\\nstrictions for backing out implicit valuations in\\nthe data just are not satisfied. After all, some-\\ntimes there is not the right kind of variation in\\nthe data to estimate a conventional demand\\ncurve, but that does not imply that a demand\\ncurve does not exist. These difficulties are less\\noften encountered in imputing implicit prices of\\ncharacteristics from goods and land market\\nprices. Prices and attributes of goods and land\\nare almost always measured independently of\\nthe characteristics of buyers and sellers. Of\\ncourse many aspects of product attributes may\\nbe highly correlated, making it difficult to ex-\\ntract the value of any single one of them. The\\nstratification problem more often arises in labor\\nmarkets, because observed wages always re-\\nflect the total bundle of both job and worker-\\nproductivity attributes. The correlation between\\nthem can be too large to separate the compo-\\nnents. In sum, potential for stratification places\\nlimits on the empirical applicability of the he-\\ndonic method. Sometimes it cannot be used, but\\nthe test is always empirical.\\nColinearity affects the precision with which\\neffects can be estimated, but sometimes there is\\nbias in estimating the importance of equalizing\\n\\n\\n###\",\n",

This\\nfrequently occurs in the labor-market setting\\nwhen one estimates compensating differences\\nin wage functions. A good example involves the\\ntrade-off between pensions and wages. Other\\nthings equal, jobs with higher pension benefits\\nshould have lower wages because the total\\namount that employers are willing to pay for a\\ngiven worker should not vary with the compo-\\nsition of the compensation package and because\\nworkers are willing to trade wages for pensions.\\nIn Figure 3, the observed trade-off is shown by\\nthe locus AB, which is the estimated market\\nrelation of wages to pensions. Note that it is\\npositively sloped, but this is not because work-\\ners do not view both wages and pension benefits\\nas goods. Instead, it reflects the fact that more\\nproductive workers, who are richer, take some of\\ntheir income in the form of wages and some in the\\nform of pensions. The (pl offer function reflects\\nthe bid by firms to low-productivity workers and\\nthe (p2 function reflects the bid by firms to high-\\nproductivity workers. Even if all workers had the\\nsame preferences, as shown by the dotted offer\\nfunctions (the one to the northeast reflecting\\nhigher utility), the market equilibrium would se-\\nlect points A and B. For any given worker, the\\ntrade-off would be negative because then the (p or\\n0 curves would be relevant. But the market ob-\\nserves the AB line, because key productivity fac-\\ntors cannot be held constant. The AB line might\\nwell be estimated with precision, depending on\\nthe amount and nature of the data, but it identifies\\nneither a firm's nor worker's willingness to trade\\noff pensions for wages.\\nIV. Diversity and Specialization\\nSpecialization, division of labor, and the or-\\nganization of work socially create much of the\\ndiversity observed in economics. In his compel-\\nling discussion, Smith identified scale econo-\\nmies as the principal cause of specialization.\\nInstead of working alone and doing everything\\nby oneself, it is productive for a worker to join\\nteams and assign individual members to a few\\nmutually exclusive tasks. The division of labor\\nis one of the most important bits of economic\\nanalysis at the extensive margin. How are pro-\\nductive activities packaged and bundled to-\\ngether into jobs, and who works on them?\\nFor the economy as a whole, the most impor-\\ntant reason by far for specialization and division\\nof labor are scale economies in utilizing ac-\\nquired skills. The returns to investing in a par-\\nticular skill are proportional to the frequency of\\nits subsequent use. This makes it efficient to use\\nth'e skills one has already acquired as inten-\\nsively as possible and not to spread oneself too\\nthinly over a highly diversified portfolio. These\\nsame connections between capacity and utiliza-\\ntion apply to all capital goods, not only to\\nhuman-capital varieties. The costs of construct-\\ning an office building depend on its size; but\\nonce it is built, it is efficient to keep the offices\\nas fully occupied as possible because the mar-\\nginal cost of an unoccupied office is much\\nsmaller than its average cost.\\nSpecialization is optimal if learning new\\nskills involves significant fixed costs that are\\nonly loosely linked to the intensity of subse-\\nquent utilization. Then it is best to learn a few\\nskills very well and use them all the time. These\\nbasic forces produce enormous social gains\\nfrom trade. We could all build our own houses\\nand educate our own children. Instead, we use\\nmarkets to buy new houses built by expert\\nhouse builders and purchase educational ser-\\nvices for our children from expert teachers. The\\nhouses are better and the children learn more.\\nSpecialization and trade are important causes of\\neconomic diversity among people in society.\\nMany aspects of economic diversity and its\\nmanifestations in economic inequality serve\\nvaluable social purposes.

They are nec-\\nessary to sustain both human-capital investment\\nincentives and work incentives.\\nFor example, in almost every society doctors\\nearn more than other people. These wage dif-\\nferentials persist in equilibrium in order to com-\\npensate prospective medical students for their\\narduous and costly training. The number and\\nquality of doctors would fall if earnings were\\nartificially compressed and the rate of return to\\nmedical education was reduced. A society with\\nfew doctors would score more egalitarian points\\non a Gini coefficient, but it would not be a better\\nsociety. This example is trivial, but the point is\\nfar more general and often not so obvious.\\nMuch inequality in the overall distribution of\\nearnings is attributable to substantial differ-\\nences in mean earnings among workers of dif-\\nferent ages and educational attainments that\\nare associated with occupational choices and\\nhuman-capital investments over the life cycle.\\nThey reflect rational personal choices that\\nchange a person\\'s economic status and current\\nincomes over a lifetime.\\nRising earnings over working life as well as\\nearnings differences between occupational\\nand educational categories largely reflect re-\\nturns to human-capital investments. A clear\\ndistinction between human-capital (lifetime)\\nwealth and current earnings is needed because\\nlearning always involves choosing prospects\\nwith smaller earnings now and higher earn-\\nings in the future. Observing that a person has\\nlow current earnings is no signal of lifetime\\npoverty if future earnings will be high. Sim-\\nilarly, high current earnings are no signal of\\nexcess wealth if a person paid the price in low\\nprevious earnings. The point is that the dis-\\ntribution of current income is far more un-\\nequal than the distribution of human-capital\\nwealth. Inequality indexes based on current\\ndata alone give a very misleading impression\\nof true inequality.\\nThe reasoning is most easily understood in\\nterms of an example. Consider a completely\\nequal society in which all workers have exactly\\nthe same age-earnings profiles over their ca-\\nreers. Then the distribution of annual earnings is\\na deterministic function of the age distribution\\nof workers. Societies with more variation in\\nworker age show more inequality, but that is not\\na very interesting aspect of inequality. In fact,\\nthe age distribution makes an enormous differ-\\nence to measured inequality indexes: earnings\\ndata used to assess inequality that are not age\\nstandardized are practically worthless for as-\\nsessing inequality. Remarkably, such adjust-\\nments are seldom made. Standardizing current\\nearnings data for education presents more diffi-\\ncult conceptual problems because family back-\\ngrounds and personal financial barriers on\\neducational choices distort investment margins\\nand make wage differentials not fully equaliz-\\ning on costs. Nonetheless, some portion of ed-\\nucational wage differences-and, judging from\\nthe remarkable uniformity of estimated rates of\\nreturn to education in different countries, per-\\nhaps a major portion-are equalizing on their\\ncosts. They represent productive, socially man-\\nufactured diversity and inequality that we can-\\nnot live very well without.\\nV. Personal Productivity and the Distribution of\\nEarnings\\nOf course, not all differences are willfully\\ncreated. Many are caused by inherited interper-\\nsonal differences in talents and tastes. The he-\\ndonic or characteristics approach to labor\\nmarkets bears similarities to statistical factor-\\nanalytic ideas in accounting for earnings differ-\\nences across individuals. Factor analysis\\npartitions observed variance into a small num-\\nber of unobserved, latent \"causes\" or factors. A\\nleading example is intelligence testing, where\\ntest scores are thought to reflect the quantitative,\\nanalytical, verbal, and mechanical abilities of\\nsubjects. Similarly, personal productivity and\\nearning power are ultimately determined by\\nsuch things as strength, intelligence, dexterity,\\nand attention to detail. Think of a model in\\nwhich a person\\'s earning power is \"scored\" as\\nthe sum of the amounts of each attribute pos-\\nsessed, times their market prices. If the number\\nof factors is small, important proximate causes\\nof the distribution of earnings are reduced to\\nsmall dimensions. The economic rationale for\\ncompacting the determinants of earnings into a\\nsmall set of universal factors and prices turns on\\nthe existence of unique economywide prices\\n(\"loadings\") on the factors.

       "'Economics As A Moral Science*\\nBy KENNETH E. BOULDING\\nAdam Smith, who has strong claim to\\nbeing both the Adam and the Smith of\\nsystematic economics, was a professor of\\nmoral philosophy and it was at that forge\\nthat economics was made. Even when I\\nwas a student, economics was still part of\\nthe moral sciences tripos at Cambridge\\nUniversity. It can claim to be a moral sci-\\nence, therefore, from its origin, if for no\\nother reason. Nevertheless, for many\\neconomists the very term \"moral science\"\\nwill seem like a contradiction. We are\\nstrongly imbued today with the view that\\nscience should be wertfrei and we believe\\nthat science has achieved its triumph pre-\\ncisely because it has escaped the swad-\\ndling clothes of moral judgment and has\\nonly been able to take off into the vast\\nuniverse of the \"is\" by escaping from the\\ntreacherous launching pad of the \"ought.\"\\nEven economics, we learn in the history of\\nthought, only became a science by escap-\\ning from the casuistry and moralizing of\\nmedieval thought. Who, indeed, would\\nwant to exchange the delicate rationality\\nof the theory of equilibrium price, for the\\nunoperational vaporings of a \"just price\"\\ncontroversy? In the battle between mech-\\nanism and moralism generally mechanism\\nhas won hands down, and I shall not be\\nsurprised if the very title of my address\\ndoes not arouse musty fears of sermoniz-\\ning in the minds of many of my listeners.\\nLet me first explain, then, what I mean\\nby moral and by moral science. A moral,\\nor ethical proposition, is a statement\\nabout a rank order of preference among\\nalternatives, which is intended to apply to\\nmore than one person. A preference which\\napplies to one person only is a \"taste.\"\\nStatements of this kind are often called\\n\"value judgments.\" If someone says, \"I\\nprefer A to B,\" this is a personal value\\njudgment, or a taste. If he says, \"A is bet-\\nter than B,\" there is an implication that\\nhe expects other people to prefer A to B\\nalso, as well as himself. A moral proposi-\\ntion then is a \"common value.\"\\nEvery culture, or subculture, is defined\\nby a set of common values, that is, gener-\\nally agreed upon preferences. Without a\\ncore of common values a culture cannot\\nexist, and we classify society into cultures\\nand subcultures precisely because it is\\npossible to identify groups who have com-\\nmon values.\\nMost tastes are in fact also common\\nvalues and have been learned by the pro-\\ncess by which all learning is done, that is,\\nby mutation and selection. The most ab-\\nsurd of all pieces of ancient wisdom is\\nsurely the Latin tag de gustibus non dis-\\nputandum. In fact, we spend most of our\\nlives disputing about tastes. If we want to\\nbe finicky about definitions we might turn\\nthe old tag around and say where there is\\ndisputing, we are not talking about tastes.\\nNevertheless, even personal tastes are\\nlearned, in the matrix of a culture or a\\nsubculture in which we grow up, by very\\nmuch the same kind of process by which\\nwe learn our common values. Purely per-\\nsonal tastes, indeed, can only survive in a\\nculture which tolerates them, that is,\\nwhich has a common value that private\\ntastes of certain kinds should be allowed.\\nOne of the most peculiar illusions of '"
