see that co-operation and the ability to co-operate are
powerful weapons, even in the competitive sub-llulnan
struggle for existence.l

We must hasten on to the point where, as a result of
orgallie evolution, we have the emergence of luan.
Amont, prilllitize men competition seems at first to
take on more cruel forms than aInoIlg animals. But if
evolution has apparently eolle back a Â£ew steps, it is
only to move forward tnigntily and ullceasillt,ly as
social evolution for the achievement of ends whose
grall(lelllX we as et but faintly apprehend. Competition,
begun far below mall with the rlerar lDeginnilags of life,
per.sists as one of the most fundamental laws of alliluate
existence, but evolution carries it to higher and ever
higher planes. Primitive competition incl lldes a Izarrow
circle of association azad, beyond that, slaughter for
economic advantat,e. With social evolution slaughter

Frolzo early times, and until recently, the competitive

for ages, slavery falls below the plane of competition
and is now regarded as incompatible nvitll civilization.
