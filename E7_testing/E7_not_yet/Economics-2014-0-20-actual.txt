Figure 5. 0*Net Characteristics and the Residual College Gender Earnings Gap
by Occupation
Notes: The gender pay gap for college graduate is from Figure 2, part B; the 0*Net charac-  teristics are described in Table 2. Only occupations with more than 25 male and more than 25  female observations for the college, full-time sample are included in the figure. Standard errors  are in parentheses under coefficients.

and log hours main effects. The interaction of log hours and occupation allows the
relationship between hours and earnings to differ for each occupation. The computed
elasticity of annual income with respect to weekly hours for each occupation
is graphed in Figure 3 against the residual gender pay gap for college graduates from
Figure 2, part B.34 There is a clear negative association between the residual gender
earnings gap and the elasticity of annual earnings with respect to weekly hours.
Occupations with higher elasticities have more negative log earnings gender gaps.
The largest elasticities are for business occupations and the smallest are for technology,
science and health occupations. In fact, almost half of the business occupations
have a computed elasticity that exceeds one, as does law. The business
occupation with the lowest elasticity is that of financial examiner, an occupation
often found in the federal and state government settings. Only one of the science
and technology occupations has an elasticity of earnings with respect to hours that
exceeds one and it is that of actuary.
As I will later demonstrate using data on occupations in business and law, the
impact of hours on the gender gap is large and goes far to explain much of the gender
34 The computed elasticities will be biased downward in part because of measurement error with regard to
weekly hours.
