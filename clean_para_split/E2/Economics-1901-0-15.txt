believe in colupetition must, in orcler to secure the CO11-
clitiolls of its lllailltellance, ask for lart,er govelnIllelltal

I retret that I call clo I10 lI]Ore llel-t aIlCl llOlV tllall
nerely to allude to t;wo somewhat a ntagol-listic lilles of
evollltioll. One is the Ilaovelnellt wllicll approaclleswi
tllotlt llope of evel reaclli llg-l-eal equa] i ty of oplDorttlnities
in economic colIlpetitioll. This is one of the
l-nost porelful lllovelnelltvs of the century just clrawillg
to a close allci lllllSt be borlle clearly in lllilld by any
one who would ullderstalld the great llistol-ical nlove
nlents of that centl1ry. The other line of clerelolDnlent
is follnd in the construction of great institlltiolas wllid-l
sllllt in and lilllit colnpetitio-l, T)llt oTllicll nevertlleless
are the very follllclations upon Nallicll our civilization
rests; the institutions \0Jllicll may be likened to social
savillgs balllSs or de?ositories of l-ace-acllievelllellts. I
have l-lere in lnind the t,-reat ecollollaicÂ°jtlriclical instittl
tiOllS of society, such as private property, inheritance of
property alld vested iilterests. The probressive appl
oxilllation to equality in opportunities must not be
perlxrlitted to bo so far as to ul-ldel-ll-line these illStitUtiOI-S.
In the lnul;ual acljustlllellts of these two lilles of evolution,
nalnely, the equality of opporCtlnity movemellt
and the illstitutional lllovemellts, nre have given us one
of the weit,lltiest atld at the salne time lnost clelicate
tasks of the twentieth centtlry.
Cozupetition thtls conceived is beneficent! alld the
competitive order riglltly colltrolled by society furllishes
to tnen the maxillluln of pleastlre with a millimtltll of
pain. Not only does it insure progress for the race, lDllt
to an increasing extelat all lnen participate in the benes
fits of this progress. \Ale have ilO eviclence that tl-le
colupetitive orcler is llltra-rational, and still less need
we believe that it is anti-rational, as Mr. ILidd asserts,
