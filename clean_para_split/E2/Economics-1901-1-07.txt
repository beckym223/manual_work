aicl of that developecl and disciplined illtellect, which
the severe traillino- of the present courses secures. Ful--
tllenllore, it was clollbtful whether it was a goocl iclea
for a young l.lall to go to college who intended to go
into business, since he woulcl be wastillg on college
bellclles the very years he needed tnost for learning t1le
details of his future callillg; and Inore illlportallt than
all, there was I10 well clefirled curriculuIn, which a college
could conscientiously recolnlllend to a young Inan
as wol-th his xvllile to take, at a11 similar in eharacter to
the cotlrses in law, lnedicille, or theology.
These al-gllments, combillecl with the lack of money
to llnclertalce new fllilctions, have kept Illost of our institutions
frozn orgaz:lizint, such clepartnlents up to the
present.

The ansu7er vo the first al^gllzzlellt is siIlople. The fact
that there are luatly lnen who take now a college course
ancl then gO into bllSilleSS, it iS clailnecl, I lJelieve, that
over 30 per ceIlt. of the Yale graduates clo, as a luatter
of fact, go into cotnlllercial life cloes not prove that
tlaese men prefer such a course to one bettel aclaptecl to
their lleecls; and still less does it prove that tl-lere are
not hundrecls allcl tilousands of young men in ttle country
who do not at present go to college at all) bllt nvho
would go if they felt that tllev coulcl get solnetlling of
more ;z-lllllediate lDellefit to thetll than the olcl-fashionecl
curricllla) or the old-fashioned stuclies. It is c30u1Dtless
true that if the only lligller illStit11tiOll in l;he cotntnullity
were a law school, tnanwr young men would take this
course) elrCll tlaollC 1l tneir purpose were to practice meclicine;
ltLt this cloes IlOt prove that a law school is
the best) or even a goocl coursW of preparation for lneclici

omet by the lar school.
