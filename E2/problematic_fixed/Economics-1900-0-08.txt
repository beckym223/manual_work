man who would sink the interest of a class in a supB
posed general public interest, is but depriving that class
of its OWI1 natural safeguard in the struggle for existences
If it works for itself it gets what it can sometimes

no small number of those who think they have studied
the conditions of modern progress most carefully.
Widespread and plausible as are some of these views,
I desire to take fundamental issue with those who support
them.

The system of political ethics just outlined is an outgrowth
