aicl of that developed and disciplined intellect, which
the severe traillino- of the present courses secures. Ful--
tllenllore, it was doubtful whether it was a good idea
for a young l.lall to go to college who intended to go
into business, since he would be wasting on college
benches the very years he needed most for learning t1le
details of his future calling; and Inore important than
all, there was I10 well defined curriculum, which a college
could conscientiously recommend to a young Man
as wol-th his while to take, at a11 similar in eharacter to
the courses in law, medicine, or theology.
These al-gllments, combined with the lack of money
to llnclertalce new functions, have kept Most of our institutions
from orgaz:lizint, such departments up to the
present.

The ansu7er vo the first al^gllzzlellt is siIlople. The fact
that there are luatly men who take now a college course
and then gO into business, it iS claimed, I lJelieve, that
over 30 per ceIlt. of the Yale graduates clo, as a luatter
of fact, go into commercial life does not prove that
these men prefer such a course to one bettel adapted to
their needs; and still less does it prove that tl-lere are
not hundreds and thousands of young men in me country
who do not at present go to college at all) but nvho
would go if they felt that tllev could get something of
more ;z-lllllediate lDellefit to them than the old-fashionecl
curricula) or the old-fashioned studies. It is c30u1Dtless
true that if the only higher illStit11tiOll in l;he community
were a law school, tnanwr young men would take this
course) elrCll tlaollC 1l their purpose were to practice medicine;
ltLt this does IlOt prove that a law school is
the best) or even a good coursW of preparation for medici
2le, 1lor that the demand :ror medical education is fully
omet by the lar school.
