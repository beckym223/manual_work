bird; two bosses conzpete to eluploy the same workman.
Frotll the standpoint of the bosses, the trallsaction bears
some analogy to the case of the cats. From the stand
point of the workman, the tlansaction bears no analogy
whatever to the case of the bircl. The more cats there
are, the worse for the bircl, as well a.s for the cats; the luore
bosses there are, the worse for the bosses, but the better
for the workman. When Adam Smith showed the
efficiency of competition as a reglllator of price and an
itlerease of useful production, he furnished a powerful
defence for the existing social ordel-. He cannot, how
ever, for that reasoll, !e fail-ly charged with having been
an advocate of the interests of the property owller. Tlae
weight allcl force of his reasoning lay in the fact that he
sllowed the beneficent effects of such coolopetition upon
the colntnullity as a whole, rather than on persons most
ilumecliately interested. He may have exaggerated
those good effects and underratecl the evils by which
they were accolllpanied. I small not now try to discuss
that pOillt. But his perlnanent and decisive illfluellce
as a social reformer lay not i.l an advocacy of the views
of any class, but in his advocacy of a means of correctilag
the forlllation of class lines. The success of cotnpetition,
so far from warranting llS in the adoptioll of a
system of political Illorality and a theory of political
progress, based on aclvocacy of class ilzterests. pronres
ratller the advantage and even the llecessit) of subordiating
those interests to a wider common good.
With the institution of representative governlllent the
case is soznewhat clifferellt. Here we hasTe an organization
of localities and of classes, and a recogllition of such
clas.ses in the actual work of government. It would,
therefore, seeril as though the success of this system
were a powerful argulnent on the side of that theory
