other is his tool. No luan, however great, call hope to
ElCCOnlpliSh his results with laeither tools nor materials
ready to his hand. Even if you believe yourself wholly
disinterested you must appeal to classes and secure the
partial good which is attainable, rather than aim at the
greater good which from the outset you are fated to miss.
