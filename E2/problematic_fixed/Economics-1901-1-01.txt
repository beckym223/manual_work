The onovement in this country for college and university
training for the futul-e business man seems to
have entered within the last year or two upon a new era
in its history. Twenty years ago, when I first began to
insist that our business classes stood in need of higher
special or professional educatiol], and that this education
should be given in our colleges and universities,
my voice was like that of one cryiIlg in the wilderness
ullheeded either ly the business world, on the one hand,
or by the college world on the other.l
Even up to within ten years only one institution of
high rank had lDeen found willing to move in this direction
and to accord a half-hearted and timid support to the
idea. To-day, at lea.st a dozen of our leading institutions,
and in this list one-half dozen of tile most prominent institutions,
have decided to organize departments whose
prirllary function is that of furnishing a higher training
for commercial life.

The Unixersity of Pennsylvania lead the way nearly
twenty years ago by the astablishment of the Wharton
School of Finance and Econoxny in I88I, though the
real work was not begun until I883.Â°

The University of Chicago, altizough its original announcement
in I892 included the scheme of a College of
of Practical Affairs, did not carry out the plan untilJIlly I,
