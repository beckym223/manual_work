growth of a new idealism. What is the real import of
these faetors ?

First, the virtual disappearanee of free land. This
makes slavery forever impossible in the future. Reeellt
investigations have proved beyond the peradventure of
a doubt that slavery as a typieal eeonomie system is
ascribalJle to the existence of vast quantities of untilled
tlJacts suitable for agrieulture. Where any one ean procure
fresh land for nothing, he will not readily work for
another; and when the soil is so exuberantly fertile
that it eall endure the wastefullaess of slave eultivation,
eolnplllsorv and not volu}ltary labor will be the dominant
ellaraeteristic of the produetion. Slavery did not beeollle
important in Greeee 1lntil the eolollies yielded vast
stretches of virgin land g the yeotnall farmer in Rome
did not disappear until the world eollquests of the later
republic threw into the market sueh prodigious supplies
of new territory as to ll-lake slave labor on the large
estates luerative. It was preeisely the same eause that
produeecl slavery in the West Indies and owl the Aloleriean
eontinent. Those days, however, have gone, never to
return. Fresh supplies of that kind of land are with
insignifieant exeeptions no longer proeurable. The
older eountries are quite filled up, and in the newer
seetions conditions are unfavorable. In both Australia
and Siberia the elitIlate is inimieal to slavery. In South
Ameriea the patnpas are the home of a grazing rather
than of an agrieultural eoulmnnity, and it is well know
that the floek tending and herding life is not eondueive
to slavery on a large seale; on the other hand, the agrieultural
regions of South Ameriea have realized that
slave produetion is inadequate to meet the eompetition
of free labor in the world market where their produets
are sold. It is only in the mining distriets of South
