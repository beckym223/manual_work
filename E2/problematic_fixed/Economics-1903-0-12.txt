In the strict scientific sense, capital has indeed existed
from the time of the first hunter's bow and arrow. But
for practical purposes and for real aid in solving actual
problems, the common man is perfectly justified in
calling this the capitalistic age, just as Karl Marx was
entirely correct in employing the word " capital " to
describe the essential modern phenomenon. The economist
calls attention to the fact that capital in the
generic sense May be put into land, into trade, or into
industry; but to the interpreter of social forces the
typical form of capital to-day is industrial capital, as in
feudal times it was landed capital, and as in so many
civilizations of old it was trade capital. We have only
lately been reminded that classic Greece, for instance,
had its beginnings, its middle ages, and its modern times.
But in ancient Greece, even at the height of its power,
slave labor was the chief factor in production, and industry
was predominantly of the small, non-capitalistic
type. Again, the medixval guild systeon of industry
was in almost esZery respect a contrast to our modern
regime. The land problem is no doubt stil] important
in a country like ours where seventy per cent of the
exports are agricultural; the commercial prolDlem is
still important in a country like ours which is seeking
to secure its share in the trade of the newly opened
Orient. But were we to read the signs aright, we should
realize that in our case, as in that of all our great competitors,
the secret of ultimate success is to be sought,
not in the land question, not in our trade relations, but
in the fundamental conditions of industrial eIlterprise at
home. Industrial capital as distinct from agricultural
ol commercial capital is a product of modem times; it
has never before existed as the tolle-giving element of
society; it is destined to produce very diflerent consequences.
