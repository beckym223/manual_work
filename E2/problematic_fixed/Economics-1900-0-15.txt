a sense far different from that a7vhiell tl1e aeeidental applieation
of this word has earried with it, a thing in
volving a delegation of power by the publie to the hands
of a few men, wllieh they are able, if tl-ley please, to
misuse to the detriment of otllel-s without beilog immediately
overtaken by any legal or eommereial penalty.
That they xvill themselves suffer in the long run from
sueh misuse of powers entrusted, is very probably true;
but the reaetion upon mein i.S SO illclireet that we eal<
not rely upon it as a proteetiotl to eolllmereial soeiety
in the way that we eould rely on everyday eolnpetition
in the smaller and more individualized business of fifty
years ago. The eorl-eetives to the abuse of individual
selfishness in the eonlulereial world today are so lllElCh
less imlolediate and autotnatie than they onee were that
very few persons now preaeh unlimited eompetition as
a means of proulotillg the general good. So luarkedS
indeed, is this reaetion that there is dalager of our having
too little eonEdellee in individual initiative in the
immediate future, and of regulating these trusts by ex
el-eise of publie authority, wlliell may prove in the long
run less wise than private enterprise itself.
A similar ehallge is taking plaee in matters politieal
as well as industrial. Not only are otlr lrlunieipalities
giving examples of eombined aetion in the way of publie
works ulldreamed of a eentury ago, lDllt our nations as
a whole are undertaking yet larger eolllbi nations i l] tlse
shape of eolonial eli-lpires. What will be the ultimate
result of this last ehallge of national ehal-aeter it ls far
too early to prediet; but this is eertain: that it will
neeessarily be aeeompanied b a recognition of the faet
that publie offiee is a pulDlie trust ulore fully than it has
been reeot,nized in the past. A federation of states of
approximately equal strength ulay govern one another
