labor costs. Not all positions can be changed. There will always be 24/7 positions
with on-call, all-the-time employees and managers, including many CEOs, trial law-
yers, merger-and-acquisition bankers, surgeons, and the US Secretary of State. But,
that said, the list of positions that can be changed is considerable.
What the last chapter must contain for gender equality is not a zero sum game
in which women gain and men lose. This matter is not just a woman's issue. Many
workers will benefit from greater flexibility, although those who do not value the
amenity will likely lose from its lower price. The rapidly growing sectors of the
economy and newer industries and occupations, such as those in health and infor-
mation technologies, appear to be moving in the direction of more flexibility and
greater linearity of earnings with respect to time worked. The last chapter needs
other sectors to follow their lead.
