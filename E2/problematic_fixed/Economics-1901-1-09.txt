student's interest itl the subjeet, and the knowledge of
its wider bearings might well lighten the burden of its
routine, as well as sharpen the intelleet in its pursuit,
and in so far qualify the eanclidate for even the more
teehnieal sides of the work.

As to the third objeetioll on the part of college men,
that there is no well reeognized eurrieulum whieh ean
with a good eonseienee be reeomnlenclec1 to a young man
as likely to qualify him better for his busil-less life9 we
must admit that this proposition has been true down to a
eomparatively reeent period, and is even yet in large measure
true. But this has been the ease in the early history
of all professional and teehnieal stucRy. Compare the
eurrieululll of the law sehool at Harvard to-clay with
that of the first law sehool in the eountry, or the present
medieal sehool in Harvard with the beginning of this
sehool a eentury ago, or present day teehnieal training
with the eurrieulum for the first sehools of teehnology.
We have not, it must be admitted, worked out as yet
any body of doetrine or group of studies, theoretieal or
praetieal, whieh will eompare favorably with the systel-n
applied to law, medicine, theology or eng-ineering.
But we have at least the beginning of sueh a eurrieululll,
and, even, as it is, a eourse worth the while of young
men to take who desile to learn something of the history
and wider bearings of their future earnings; indeed,
something whiell it is worth their while to take as a
mere element in a liberal edueation, if nothing else.
And in any ease, we must begin at sol-ne time to work
out sueh a eurriellluln, and wl-ly not now as well as ever ?
But the present remarkable development has eome
about not only beeause our colleges anc1 universities
have begun to reaeh out, c1riven by the law of their own
internal development, to enter this new and unoeeupied
