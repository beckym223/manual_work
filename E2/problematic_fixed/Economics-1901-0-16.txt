inasmuch as in his view it is opposed to the interests of
the ,reat mass of well who, he vllinks, quietly submit
to this social order, on account of the social force in relit,
-ioll Vilicll bids tl-lem clo so. Religion Slas quite a
di-gel-ellt office to t3erforlll, for its office is rat;her to raise
competition to higher planes and to t-llilagle rith it in a
harInoIliouvs ?:)lend, slnpathy and love, without by any
aleans clisplacine, collllDetitioll itself.

and the brave and Istrolito are merciful.
It has lDeetl rell said that as organic evolution bives
us mall, so social evolution gives the ideal luall.l Btlt
ecoSlolllic competition is atl e.ssential eonstituent of that
social evolution which is proclacillt, the ideal man; and
with comptitioll are tninoletl other lSe>,lllative prillciles.
PsycholoCically, the ego and the alter ego, self and
other self, arise t3t,ether; ecoololllically they engage in
many a conflict, bllt tl-zeir spheres of i1lterest are never
entirely antagonistic to each other in the struggle for
life. The ebo tlleself- -elalart,es the sphere of its selfhood;
and this ridellillb and deepeninb goes on until
the Christian ideal of llutnanity is at last attained.
Bllt the vlpsrard struggle is part and parcel of the
attailltxlent o-f idea.lss; and, ribhtly conceived, elevated
to a sllffieiellt llei>-lat, this sstrubgle iol econotnic life
means competition; it tnealls rivalry in the service of
self and otl-ler selves rivalry in the vlpbuilding of the
ideal mull in tile ideal society.
