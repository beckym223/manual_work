company of hypocrites and pharisees. He will be a
more efEcient reformer if he claims a little less for his
nission and catl get those lesser claims recognized, than
if he claims everytlling allci gets no recognition at all.
We are further told that whether he be considered
a hypocrite or not, he sarill be entitled a visiollary,
and justly so. The general public whose itlterests he
represents is not a working political force. Its interests
are so vague and remote that there is no lllealls of getting
them recognized in the collcrete work of legislation
and of government. You tntlst appeal to localities
and to classes. Localities have their representatives,
classes have their organs. Each locality and each class
has its public sentimellt, which in one way or another
-is a living power in politics. This existence of a coherent
public opinion and of a deSnite interest is a necessary
condition for the social refortner, who would be
more than a pure theorist. The one is his material, the
other is his tool. No luan, however great, call hope to
ElCCOnlpliSh his results with laeither tools nor materials
ready to his hand. Even if you believe yourself wllolly
disinterested you must appeal to classes and secure the
partial good which is attainable, rather than aim at the
greater good which from the outset you are fated to miss.
They tell us further that this view of the matter represents
not only practical politics but practical ethics.

has standards and ideals of its own, differing from those
of other classes. Civil liberty is but a recognitioll of
these differences permissioll to the variotls menlbers of
$he state to pursue their own several ends under the protection
