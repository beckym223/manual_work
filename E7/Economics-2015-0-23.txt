Figure 5. Net Economic Gains from Different Regimes
Notes: Gains are global total in 201 1 US international $. In each case, the gain is relative to  zero abatement. The total includes abatement costs, damages, and trade inefficiencies. Note  that the far left bar for each group is the gain in the noncooperative (zero-participation) out-  come. For the interpretation of the graph, see Figure 3. Note that the graph is truncated at $400  billion at the top, with the figure for highest benefit regime shown.
Figure 6. Percent of Potential Gains from Cooperation Achieved by Different
Regimes
Notes: Bars show the global gain in each regime relative to the noncooperative outcome as a  percent of the difference between the 100 percent cooperative and the noncooperative result.  Gains are as defined in Figure 5. For the interpretation of the graph, see Figure 3.
