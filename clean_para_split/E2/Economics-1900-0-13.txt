compromise in which the interests of the part which
they represent shall have adequate recoanitioll. This
substitution of compromise for COllViCtiOll as the ideal
of legislative activity is perhaps the oreatest and most
pervasive evil ulader which our political machinery
suffers. It shows its effect in the demoralizing principle
that the l-epreselltative should be guided in his
utterallces and his votes by the opiniolas of his COllstituellts,
rather tllall lDy lais own a principle which, in
spite of all protests, has come to be gelzerally accepted
in practical politics. It deprives the member of the
legislature of the educatiollal influence incidellt to his
pOSitiOtl. It makes him an agent not only of his district,
but of his party within his clistrict. It mallifests
its results in appropriatioll bills, where the Inembers
who stalld up for the general interest of the treasury are
illcreasingly rare, and those who luake claims for the
expenditure of money on bellalf of their localities and
often on behalf of private interests within their localities
beconle constantly louder. It shows itself even in
general legislation, where the character of llloderll
statutes as a patcllwork of private demallds has become
only too llotoriotls.
All this has gone so far as to produce a change in the
public estilnate of parliamelltary bodies. The glorificatioll
or idealizatioll of the legislature, so cotnlllon in
g-eneratiolls illlmediately gone by, is rapidly passillg
away. In matters of municipal government we are lessellilag
the application of the old represeoltative systemgiVillg
more power to the lnayor and those persolls appointed
by the tllayor, and less to the representatives of
the several districts; because, with the amount of busi-
-ness that is done by the ordillary lnunicipality, we cannot
afford to let the gelzeral interests of the xvhole be
