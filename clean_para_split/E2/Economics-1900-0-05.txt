his fellow members of the comlllllnity; that in this field
of exceptional doubt he should ulldertake to realize the
very highest icleals as a scientific mall who stands above
the clouds of prejudice, and therefore sees farther than
those about him; that it is his high mission to be the
repre.seoltative and the chatllpion of the permanent interests
of the whole cotntnullity, in the face of conflicting
clailus from representatives of telnporary or partial
ones.

This view of the IlliSSiOll and the duties of the political
econoluist has been challenged on three grounds: as
bad psychology, bad politics, and bad etllics. We are
told, in the first place, that as a lnatter of practical psychology,
no anan can wake his judgmellt as to llational
well-being independent of his social antecedellts and his
ethical training. If he has gl-own Up among soldiers,
he will have one set of standards; if he has growll np
among btlsiness men, he will have a second; if he has
grown l:Lp aluong literary men, he will have a third; if
he has grown up alnong laborers, he will have a fourth.
Strive as he may to disassociate llilnself frotn the ef-fects
of education and envirollmellt, he can at best be but
partially successful. His political vision suffers not
only from nearsiglltedness, but froln astiglllatisIll. He
may correct the former; no power on earth can ellable
him to correct the latter, or even to gain an objective
estimate of its effects. Robert Malthus was a disinterested
man, and so was Hellry George; yet in neither
case was such disinterestedlless sufficieolt to protect them
frorn obliquities of moral vision which led to diametrically
opposite conclusions as to the conditiotls of public
prosperity. A man may have the intentioIl to be impartial,
and may be perfectly canclid in the belief that
he has carried out this illtentioll; but that only makes
