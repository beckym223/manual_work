I believe it should reeogllize it as one of its ploper and
neeessary funetions to provide the best faeilities of whieh
it is eapable for this training, aIld I aIn happy to say,
that in l-ny opinion the question iS no longer whether
the Al-lleriean university shall take this attitude, but
simply lloev it ean reeognize this ftlnetion and earry it

The question as to wl-lat sllolllci be the fundamental
element in the higher edueation and training of the future
business mall, is to l-he eolllparatively simple. It should
be those branelles of seienee wlliell deal with the departments

or anatouly to lneclieal trainin>. It has, moreover,
the added advantage of beiIlg the most highly developed
of all these subjeets, theoretically or praetieally, botl-l as
a matter of seienee anci as a Inatter of pedagogy. The
mall nvho grapples in earnest with problems of eeonotnies
will seeure, if nothing else, a tnental diseiplille
