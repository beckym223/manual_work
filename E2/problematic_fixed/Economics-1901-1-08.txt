This argument has, however, a certain practical weight
and is llearcR most often, perhaps, al:llong business men
themselves. It is, llowes7er, the same old objection mich
has been raised at,ain.st higher education in every clepartrnellt,
viz.: that young men should begin with the
A, B, C, of the business or profession in practical life
rather than waste their time on theoretical courses in
college. The old-fashioned way to study medicine was
to begin by harnessing up the doctor's horse, as he preparecT
to go his rounds, following this up by taking
medicine to the patients, and vasllillg and cleaning the
mortars and pestles used in their preparation. The lawyer
began by eopying papers, and the merchant by
sweeping Out the snop; the book-lDinclillg apprentice, b),r
washing the dinner dishes for tl-le housewife, etc. But
this idea has alreadr been g-ivell up iu the case of cel--
tain important callings, and must gradually disappear in
the case of many others.l

As to the secoolcl point, tl-lere is undoubtedly some
danger that the young well wl-lo spend from seven to
eight years in the study of Ivatin, Greek and mathematics,
(>r even in the study of French and Gertlan, and natural
science, may acquire, if not a taste for literary callings, at
least a distaste for mercantile life. But this does not t,)rove
that the pursuit of a llighel- course of study, which sl-loulcR
be related more closely to their future work w0111cl have
the same effect. The study of the history and methods
of insurance, for example, in all their different aspects,
need not of itself destroy all interest of young
men in the business of insurance as a practical career;
on the contrary, it would very probalDly inerease the
lC:f. no. II in the list of monographs, etc., on commelcial education
appended to this paper.
