Figure 7. Winners and Losers from the Climate Club
Notes: Estimates show the gains for regions in four selected regimes. The gains are relative to the noncoopera-  tive regime and are in 201 1 US international $ per year. The graph is truncated at $30 billion to magnify the scale.
What explains the pattern of gains and losses? It is primarily determined by the
carbon-intensity of production and trade openness. South Africa and Eurasia are
the only countries showing a high fraction of losses because they have high carbon
intensity. They must either incur expensive abatement costs or pay dearly through
sanctions on their international trade. Countries with high damages (such as India)
show gains in all regimes.
