of a comtnon law. Accordilg to this view, the
man who would sink the interest of a class in a supB
posed general public interest, is but deprivillg that class
of its OWI1 natural safeguard in the struggle for existences
If it works for itself it gets what it can sometilnes
more than it ought, sometilnes less than it ought; but in
a reasonably well-ordered civil societ5J it takes its cllallces
with the others. If a silogle group, in its zeal for the
general good, otnits to pursue its own grOllp interest, it
causes a want of balallce between the parts, upsets the
conditions of the gaule, and cotltributes rather to its
OWI1 annillilation than to the predolninallce of those
conceptions with which it has iclelltified itself. Let us
have fair play; let t1S have a fair cllance for collflicting
views to strugt,le olae with another, as a cotlditioIl of
progress for the whole society. This is the cry amolog
no small nulnber of those who think they have studied
the conditions of modern progress most carefully.
Widespread and plausible as are some of these views,
I desire to take fulldalnental issue with those who support
them.

The system of political ethics just outlilled is an outgrowth
of ollr experience with two important institu
tions, competition and representative government.
Competition has led people to see now frequently the
self-interest of the individual, as given free play, confl
dtlces to the general advance of the pulDlic. Representative
government has showll how a full expression of
opinion by those who speak for the several parts or
classes in the community can be made to colltribllte to an
advance which inures to the advantage of all parts and all
classes together. Yet in the face of these facts, I believe
that the theory of struggle and cotnpromise as a normal
means of progl-ess neecls restatement; and that the lnall
