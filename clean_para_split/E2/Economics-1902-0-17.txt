about this principle. Yet it is easy for cc)lltl-act to abl-ogate
the right of cot,ltract. \Allle1lever a Inal1 colatracts
hilMSelf into t-1 COnditiOIl of virtual slavery, tlwis is the
case. I have already cited the xvell-k1lorlln cases brought
before J udge Bennett of Soutll Carolina. Cases have
arisen in Germany, under *Nrlnat is called tile "coznpetitive
clause " of labor contracts. It seellls that there it is
quite ctlstcxmary to insist llpOtl a contract Witil an employee,
learni1ag a travle or occUpAtion, tilAt 1lt Small not'
after he hAs aCqUil-ed his lirilOR\7ledoe Of the 5LlSineSS,
eIlter into competition with his employer. Sometiines
there is a limitation UpO11 the period or area vitllin
wllicll 1lo competition must be attemptecl, 1laakitlg the
clause a fairly reasonable c)ne. Sometimes, however, a
lad utterly incompetent to contzeInplate the remote COt]-
sequences of lliD act, and not liaxtillC five dollars tc) his
name, will agree uncler a pellalty of perllaps several
thousand dollars not to enter into cornpetition R7ith his
employer duritlg his Xrllole life, or itl the e1lsil-e German
empire, and sometimes it is said, not allyR;here in the

respect to their impairment, directly o1- indirectly, of the
ritllt to zanake future contracts, it xvill be foulad that
many regulations are 1zecessary in the itaterests of liberty.
Contracting-out as it is 110u7 tecllNically callerl, OC1S
