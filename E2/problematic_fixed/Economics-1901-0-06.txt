and equally familiar are the selective processes of
natlll e, reslllti llg i ll the stlrvi val of those fittest for their
environment at a particular time and place. Not quite
so familiar to all al-e other aslDects of 1lature's olletllocls.
Aftel- the aI)pearallce of JDal-XviIl's epocll-makillg lDook,
" The Origin ot Species," l:)iologists Erst brought out
the hard and cruel side of the strl.lt,gle for existence.
Rollsseall's pictures of mild and benefice lt Nature were
replaced iil their clescriptiosls by the collcepticall of
Nature as ' led itl tooth and elaw ritll ravill." Even
Htl-xler spoke of the allill-lal world as ot] about the
same level as a glacliatol-'s SllONV. ;; The cl-eattlres ", said
he "are fairly well treated and set to fight; wllerebr
the strotlbest, the sviftest, the clltzllinbest, live to fight
another clay. The spectator has 1lo need to turn his
tllllIlllD do.rn, as olO qllal-ter is ,iven." 1 But it was hot
long before careful observation resrealed other axpects of
nature'>s processes. AIr. Alfred Rnssel MWallace long
ago called attelltiool to the comparitively painless
character of tl-le struggle along allilncals, and to the
lart,-e atllOtoIlt of happiole.ss in their lives. After reviesring
the ethical aspect of the stl-llgble for existence, he
expressed the opinion that it aSol-cls " the maximum of
life and of tl]e enjoyment of life with tIle luillillltlln of
StlHetfillg aIld pain." 2 Wl-lell xwe watch aailalal exi.ste1-lces
as a whole, and not i n exceptional moments, Call we
conclude otherwise? But subsequent observel-s, going
further, have-called attention first to the fact that the
strl1g-<,le i.s not for life lllerelr, lout for tllC life of
otl1el^s. These otllel-s are first of all offslDril-lg, but later
ates and companions. Again, attention has been
called to a.ssociatio1l and lnl1tual aicl among- animals as
l tfEle Struggle foz Bxistellce. lViotetee^th Ceez.tzzo , Febmary, I888.
