llberty means the explessioIl of positixTe pORVelS of the
individual, and that it Call be reached only cls a result
of a long and tstrclllous constructive process. Green tells
zIS in these xrorcls what he means by li4erty orfreeclotn:
" We do not mean onerelv fleecloll-l from restraint or
compulsion. 5Ale clo not lizeaxl lllerel fl-eeclozn to do as
we like irrespectivrely of what it is that we like. We
do not mean a freec10on that cAn be elljoaTed by one man,
or orle set of then, at the cost of a loss of freedom to
others. When we speak of freedoul as somethillt,- to be
highly prizee1, we mean a positive power or capacity of
doitlt, o1 enjoying solnetllillt, worth doing or enjoying,
aold that, too, solnetlaillg tl]at we clo ol enjoy in common
with others. \Ale mean by it a zower which each than
exelcises through the l-lelp ol security given hioll hy his
fellowtlle2l, and -ullicll he in turn 1lellDs to secure for
them. W}lell we lloeasure the progress of a .<ociety by
tl-ze growth in freedom, re naeastlre it ly the increasing,
development and exercise o]l the whole of those poJers
of contrib.lting to social good -with which we believe
the zzlember.s of the societ) to be endoxved; in short,
by the >reattr power on the part of the citizens as a
bocler to make tlae most and best of tllelllfselxres."
Ais anal-clar gives 11s tl-le logical outcome of one line
of thought concerllint, liberty, so we find another line
of ttzollgllt, regarding libert, going far beyond the
necessary iz;-lzlications of Green's pOSitiOIl and terlMinatillg
in the fDppOSite eNtrelne, socialism.
As i'&dAnl SlllitlI 'S XlD4lilOSOphy Of liberty is atl expression
of the ei>-llteellth century, Tholuas Hill Green's
view xuay l)e looked upon as all expression of the

view. One of the most fundamental is, perhaps, found
