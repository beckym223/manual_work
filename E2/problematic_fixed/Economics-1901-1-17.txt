It seems to me that it would be just as reasonable to
expect the average young man to select the subjects
without assistance which would be of special value to
him as eolnmercial training from a list of a thousand
elective courses, as it would be to expeet the young than

subjects which would be of most advantage to him, if
these letal subjects were thrown into a pot along with

offers faeilities for aequiring that added infomlation
and experienee he would like to have, the notion
beeomes definitely eoncrete to him, and he looks forward
with pleasure and zest to the idea of attending sueh an
institution. When you say to the boy who is going into
