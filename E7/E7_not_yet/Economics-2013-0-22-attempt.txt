surplus. These considerations are quantitatively important in recent years, with the
expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and its beginning to pay interest on reserves.
Surprise inflation is not easy to quantify. During the late 1970s and early 1980s
inflation underwent wide swings that were not well tracked by statistical models fit
to historical data. Probably expectations about future inflation were diverse during
1973-1983, not well summarized by any single number. A Bayesian VAR model
using the log of the chained PCE deflator and the one-year interest rate gives reason
able-looking results, but its time series of forecast errors is quite different from what
is obtained by predicting inflation over year t as simply equal to inflation over year
t — 1, and the sum of squared forecast errors is nearly the same for the two forecast
ing methods. The simple tt, = tt,_1 forecasts were used to produce the figure, but the
figure would have looked noticeably different if the VAR forecasts had been used.
Hall and Sargent (2011) calculate ex post real and nominal returns on US govern
ment debt by a method that does not rely on the NIPA data to compute a primary
surplus. It is possible to use their ex post real returns, together with the one-year
interest rate series and the inflation forecast error series and a series for the level of
the debt, to compute the same concept shown in Figure 1.1 made those calculations,
and they produce fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as in the figure, but
again with a different time profile.
B. Sources for Table 1
These data were drawn from the international component of the FRED database
provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The interest rates are those
labeled "government bond" interest rates. The debt to GDP ratios are provided in
that form by FRED. They are the most recent available at the time of writing.
