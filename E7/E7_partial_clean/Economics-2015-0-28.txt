Notes: What international target carbon price would regions prefer when the global SCC is $25  per ton? For example, the US national welfare is highest when the target price is $28 per ton.  Countries with high damages and low abatement costs such as the EU prefer high target prices.  The table shows the optima without trade effects. The optima with trade effects have higher  country-preferred target carbon prices.  * Countries with multiple local optima.
damages. There will be second-order effects through cost-of-capital factors, GDP,
and other economic variables. But a changed discount rate will affect the outcome
primarily through changes in the SCC.
VIII. Conclusion
The present study analyzes the syndrome of free-riding in climate agreements such
as the Kyoto Protocol and considers potential structures for overcoming free-riding.
This concluding section summarizes the basic approach and conclusions.
A. The Climate Club
The structure of climate change as a global public good makes it particularly
susceptible to free-riding. The costs of abatement are national, while the benefits are
