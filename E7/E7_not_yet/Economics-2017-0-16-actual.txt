Notes: For news and newspapers (1950-2016, from ProQuest) it is the number of articles with  this phrase as a percent of all articles that year. For books (1950-2008, from Google Ngrams) it  is the number of occurrences of Laffer Curve divided by the total number of words in the data-  base for that year, in percent.
for many years, as in the model Figure 2, though it shows something of an upturn
again after 2000. For books, the curve rises more slowly, for five of six consecutive
years, from 1978 to 1983, before entering a long period of slow decline, as in
Figure 2.
The Laffer Curve owes much of its contagion to the fact that it was seen as justifying
major tax cuts. The Laffer Curve's contagion related to fundamental political
changes associated with Ronald Reagan's election as US president in 1980 with
his commitment to cutting taxes (and with Margaret Thatcher, but not the socialist
François Mitterrand elected around that time).
The Laffer Curve is an inverted U curve relating tax revenue to tax rates, a theory
that was used to justify cutting taxes on high-income people since high taxes
incentivize them to produce less. The notion that taxes might reduce the incentive
to earn income and create jobs was hardly new: the idea was expressed as long
ago as Adam Smith in the eighteenth century.7 Andrew Mellon, US Treasury
Secretary, 1921-1932, was famous for his "trickle down" economics, and, along
with US President Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929), successfully argued for reduction
of income taxes that had remained high for a while after World War I. But then the
Mellon name began to fade (outside of Carnegie-Mellon University), and the theory
lost persuasive narrative.
The story of the Laffer Curve did not go viral in 1974, the reputed date when
Laffer first introduced it. Its contagion is explained by a literary innovation that was
first published in a 1978 article in National Affairs by Jude Wanniski, editorial writer
7 "[A tax] may obstruct the industry of the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of  business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes." Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations Vol.  II (1869, p. 416).
