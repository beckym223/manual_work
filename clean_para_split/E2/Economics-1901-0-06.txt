Htl-xler spoke of the allill-lal world as ot] about the
same level as a glacliatol-'s SllONV. ;; The cl-eattlres ", said
he "are fairly well treated alld set to fight; wllerebr
the strotlbest, the sviftest, the clltzllinbest, live to fight
another clay. The spectator has 1lo lleed to turll his
tllllIlllD do.rn, as olO qllal-ter is ,iven." 1 Bllt it was tlOt
long before careful observation resrealed other axpects of
nature'>s processes. AIr. Alfred Rnssel MWallace lollg

character of tl-le struggle allloIlg allilncals, and to the
lart,-e atllOtoIlt of happiole.ss in their lives. After reviesring
the ethical aspect of the stl-llgble for existence, he
expressed the opinion that it aSol-cls " the lnaximutn of
life alld of tl]e elljoylnent of life with tIle luillillltlln of
StlHetfillg aIld pain." 2 Wl-lell xwe xvatcll aailalal exi.ste1-lces
