As a result of the nature of lzaan, of the conclitions of
existence in a srorld like ours, and of the great llistol-ical
institutions wllicll have come down to llS, men exist in
classes. These classes, in tnoclern times, rest upon all

or unsuccessfully as the case may be, to promote
liberty. All action whid-l endeavors to l-emove ignorallce
and superstition and to strengthen the individual,
mentally, morally and physically, is action which endeavors
