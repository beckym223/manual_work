who looks below the surface in the study of these two
institutions, will be brought to conclusions directly opposite
from those which prevail in so lullell of the current
thought of the world to-day.

Does the theory of competition ,ive ground for the
view that a struggle between different parts for their
class interests, works out in an econzo1nic harmony?
Not at all. It shows, on the contra1-y, that strugg-les
ZeviShiv each class, antagonistic for the moment to the
appare11t interests of that class, so conduce to the interests
of many other parts of the body politic as to work
GUt a generally beneficent result. No econelllist of any
reputatiol1 would hold for a moment that the econonoic
struggles of differel1t men for themselves, wol11d furnish
a reasonable basis of adjustment, or conaproollise, with
those in diGerent positions. What the chanopioll of
competition holds, is rather tl-lat the struggles of each
mall for llilll.self prevent others, who are in a sionilar
position, from takiolg undtze advantage over their fellow
nen. It is not a conflict between classes, but a conflict
within classes, which he seeks to perpetuate; aold he
would perpetuate it because he can prove, or thinks
that he can prove, that it conduces to a comlllol1 interest
more wide and more lasting than those which the individual
classes, if organi%ecl into trusts or trades unions,
would seek to pursl1e.

It is popularly said that coznpetitiol1 is only the form
which the struggle for existence takes in modern civili

form, false in the suggestions to which it gives rise.
The fact is, that modern civilized communities have so
regulated the struggles for existence, that tl1ey tend, on
the whole, to the benefit of third parties, rat11er than to
their detriment. Two cats stmggle to eat the same
