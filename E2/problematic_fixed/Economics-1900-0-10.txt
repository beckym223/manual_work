bird; two bosses compete to eluploy the same workman.
From the standpoint of the bosses, the transaction bears
some analogy to the case of the cats. From the stand
point of the workman, the tlansaction bears no analogy
whatever to the case of the bird. The more cats there
are, the worse for the bird, as well a.s for the cats; the luore
bosses there are, the worse for the bosses, but the better
for the workman. When Adam Smith showed the
efficiency of competition as a regulator of price and an
itlerease of useful production, he furnished a powerful
defence for the existing social ordel-. He cannot, how
ever, for that reason, !e fail-ly charged with having been
an advocate of the interests of the property owner. The
weight and force of his reasoning lay in the fact that he
showed the beneficent effects of such coolopetition upon
the community as a whole, rather than on persons most
ilumecliately interested. He may have exaggerated
those good effects and underrated the evils by which
they were accompanied. I small not now try to discuss
that point. But his permanent and decisive influence
as a social reformer lay not i.l an advocacy of the views
of any class, but in his advocacy of a means of correcting
the formation of class lines. The success of competition,
so far from warranting llS in the adoption of a
system of political Morality and a theory of political
progress, based on advocacy of class interests. pronres
rather the advantage and even the llecessit) of subordiating
those interests to a wider common good.

With the institution of representative government the
case is somewhat different. Here we hasTe an organization
of localities and of classes, and a recognition of such
clas.ses in the actual work of government. It would,
therefore, seeril as though the success of this system
were a powerful argument on the side of that theory
