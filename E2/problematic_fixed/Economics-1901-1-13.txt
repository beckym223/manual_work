themselves of higher edlleation, and soeiety demands it
of them as never before.
There is, moreover, a growing belief in the effieaey
of professional ecltleation and speeial training as a
valuable or indispensable elen-zent in the preparation of
the young man for l-lis future ealling. A eentllry ago

I beliexe the Auleriean university ought to take the

long taken toward the professional edueatioll of the
