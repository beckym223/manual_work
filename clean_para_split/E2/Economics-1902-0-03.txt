understand the theoretieal and praetieal eonelusions
reaelled by that philosophy. The probleln wllieh presented
itself to our forefatllers, and to Freneh statesmen,
as well as to English thinkers, was essentially negative.
Restrietions onust be removed. Favoritism onust be
abolished, and the laws tnaking possible restrietions and
favoritislll must be repealed. The restrietions upon
liberty svllieh nvere then llotieed ssZere restrietions of a
politieal nature. Collseqllently the probleln of liberty
was eoneeived to be essentially a politieal problem, as
well as a negative one.
Closely assoeiated witl-l this cloetrille of equality was
the doetrille of the bellefieellee of self-interest. Inaslnuell
as men were essentially equal, eaell olze eould best
gElarCl his own interests individually, provicled only the
halllperillg fetters of the law sholllc1 maiSe way for a
reign of liberty. Tillle cloes not perlllit llle to follow
out, as I would like, the clevelopment of this negative
view of liberty, wlliell I have presented. Frotll it we
may traee ollt a very elearly onarked line of evolution of
thought, and a solIlewhat less elearly marked line of
evolution of politieal praetiee. Through various
writers we reaeh Herbert Speneer's treatment of liberty
as a negative allci politieal probletn. The areat elleony
of freedoon, he holds, is the state tnanifesting itself in
laws clireeting Iluman aetisTity, alld in his opinion, leading
illevitably to slavery, unless the flow of legislation
is in some way eheeked. We find Herbert Speneer
preaehing his doetrine of liberty in his " Soeial Staties "
in I85I, and asserting in it the right of man to clisregard
tTle state, and ila tnore reeent tilnes he expounds his
doetrine in artieles bearing sueh titles as these: "The
Cotning Slavery ", " The Sins of Legislators ", " The
Great Political Superstition."
