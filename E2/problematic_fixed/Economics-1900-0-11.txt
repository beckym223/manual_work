of politics and of ethics which regards the good of the
whole community as best to be reaehed by a eoznpromise
between the aims of different sections of the eoznlllullity.
But a profouncler study of constitutional llistoryr leads
to an opposite conclusion. It snows that lDarlialllents
and eollgresses, in the really ,reat periods of their
history, have been valuable, not as a field of eomproznise
