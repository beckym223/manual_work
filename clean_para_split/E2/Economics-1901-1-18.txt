business that the university offers him the opportunity
to prepare hilnself for such work, you ^rill find that his
attitude toward the university will be an entirely new
one, and that an entirely new element of the community
- a most nulnerous and nlost important element- will
have been brought within the influence of the university.
The next important pOillt relates to the form of orgallization
of this work and its integration into the
rest of the ullix7ersity system. I think there is little
doubt that this will vary with each institution and its
needs, and I think it is desirable that there slloulcl be
the utmost liberty in this respect for the fullest ancl
freest experimentatioll. My own feeling- based upon
thirteen years' experience in connectioIl with the \Alharton
School of Finance and Scollolny, i 1l which xve
tried lnany clifferent scheIlles- is that the typical forln
will be the regular four-years' course parallelint, the traditional
college course, but strongly inclining in spirit
and forlol, rather to the techllical than to the literary
course.

Of the existillb departments, Pennsylvania, Chicago,
California, the Colunlbia scl-leme ancl the University of
Wiscollsin, have adoptecl the four-year plan and each
with the exception of the Columbia plan offers as the
croxvn of the work a bachelor's clegree. The IJniversities
of B/liclligan allcl Verlllont have adopted in essence the
twoyear course, coverillg the last two years in college,
admitting all who have con-pleted the sopllomore year in
any course in college; while Dartlllollth college has
adopted a two-year plan, adlnitting. llowerler, only those
who have colllpleted the juniol yeart thlls making the
second year graduate in character.
And Ellally, if as Presiclent Hadley has told us in his
address before the Vanderbilt University at its recent
