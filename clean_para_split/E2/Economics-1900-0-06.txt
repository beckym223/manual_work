matters worse, because this delusiol-l prevellts him frotn
recognizing the need of applyitlg outside correctives to

W1ly not, uncler these circutllstallces, adulit freely the
difiiculty under which we labor in ollaki llg objective
judglllellts ? W}ly not recot nize from the first that each
of lIS represents a locality or a class, aIlcR that the moral
judgmelat of each observer is sure to be affected and to

Such a course, fratlkly adoptecl, its advocates clailll, will

neither very good nor very bacl from that ollixture of
hypocrisy atld self-cleceptioll which contrives to coollbille

like Johll Stuart Mill, it ploved approximately
possible, would not be good politics. The assulllption
by all economist that he represents the total
interest of the community rather than the interest of
some one part or class iol that colllmuolity, exposes hiln

or one who pretellds to a righteousness which he
does not possess. If either of these titles is a jllSt one,
it interferes with a mall's success as a political reforlller.
If it is even suspected to be just, it will prove a heavy
weight around his neck. Even if a lnan believes hiInself
to be wholly free from either hyprocisy or pharisaism,
it is a wise measure for him to keep out of the
