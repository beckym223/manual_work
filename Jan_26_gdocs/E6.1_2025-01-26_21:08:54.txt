Adam Smith, who has strong claim to
being both the Adam and the Smith of
systematic economics, was a professor of
moral philosophy and it was at that forge
that economics was made. Even when I
was a student, economics was still part of
the moral sciences tripos at Cambridge
University. It can claim to be a moral science,
therefore, from its origin, if for no
other reason. Nevertheless, for many
economists the very term "moral science"
will seem like a contradiction. We are
strongly imbued today with the view that
science should be wertfrei and we believe
that science has achieved its triumph precisely
because it has escaped the swaddling
clothes of moral judgment and has
only been able to take off into the vast
universe of the "is" by escaping from the
treacherous launching pad of the "ought."
Even economics, we learn in the history of
thought, only became a science by escaping
from the casuistry and moralizing of
medieval thought. Who, indeed, would
want to exchange the delicate rationality
of the theory of equilibrium price, for the
unoperational vaporings of a "just price"
controversy? In the battle between mechanism
and moralism generally mechanism
has won hands down, and I shall not be
surprised if the very title of my address
does not arouse musty fears of sermonizing
in the minds of many of my listeners.
Let me first explain, then, what I mean
by moral and by moral science. A moral,
or ethical proposition, is a statement
about a rank order of preference among
alternatives, which is intended to apply to
more than one person. A preference which
applies to one person only is a "taste."
Statements of this kind are often called
"value judgments." If someone says, "I
prefer A to B," this is a personal value
judgment, or a taste. If he says, "A is better
than B," there is an implication that
he expects other people to prefer A to B
also, as well as himself. A moral proposition
then is a "common value."

Every culture, or subculture, is defined
by a set of common values, that is, generally
agreed upon preferences. Without a
core of common values a culture cannot
exist, and we classify society into cultures
and subcultures precisely because it is
possible to identify groups who have common
values.

Most tastes are in fact also common
values and have been learned by the process
by which all learning is done, that is,
by mutation and selection. The most absurd
of all pieces of ancient wisdom is
surely the Latin tag de gustibus non disputandum.
In fact, we spend most of our

lives disputing about tastes. If we want to
be finicky about definitions we might turn
the old tag around and say where there is
disputing, we are not talking about tastes.
Nevertheless, even personal tastes are
learned, in the matrix of a culture or a
subculture in which we grow up, by very
much the same kind of process by which
we learn our common values. Purely personal
tastes, indeed, can only survive in a
culture which tolerates them, that is,
which has a common value that private
tastes of certain kinds should be allowed.
One of the most peculiar illusions of


### ---Economics-1969-0-04.txt---
economists is a doctrine that might be
called the Immaculate Conception of the
Indifference Curve, that is, that tastes are
simply given, and that we cannot inquire
into the process by which they are
formed. This doctrine is literally "for the
birds," whose tastes are largely created
for them by their genetic structures, and
can therefore be treated as a constant in
the dynamics of bird societies. In human
society, however, the genetic component
of tastes is very small indeed. We start off
with a liking for milk, warmth, and dryness
and a dislike for being hungry, cold,
and wet, and we do have certain latent
drives which may guide the formation of
later preferences in matters of sex, occupation,
or politics, but by far and away
the largest part of human preferences are
learned, again by means of a mutation-selection
process. It was, incidentally, Veblen'
s principal, and still largely unrecognized,
contribution to formal economic
theory, to point out that we cannot assume
that tastes are given in any dynamic
theory, in the sense that in dynamics we
cannot afford to neglect the processes by
which cultures are created and by which
preferences are learned.

I am prepared indeed to go much further
and to say that no science of any
kind can be divorced from ethical considerations,
as defined above. The propositions
of science are no more immaculately
conceived than the preferences of individuals.
Science is a human learning process
wlhich arises in certain subcultures in
human society and not in others, and a
subculture as we have seen is a group of
people defined by the acceptance of certain
common values, that is, an ethic
which permits extensive communication
among them.

The scientific subculture is no exception
to this rule. It is characterized by a strong
common value system. A high value, for
instance, is placed on veracity, on curios-
ity, on measurement, on quantification, on
careful observation and experiment, and
on objectivity. Without this common
value structure the epistemological process
of science would not have arisen; indeed
it did not arise in certain societies
where conditions might otherwise have
been favorable but where some essential
common values of the scientific subcultures
did not exist. The question as to exactly
what values and ethical propositions
are essential to the scientific subculture
may be in some dispute. The fact that
there are such values cannot be disputed.
It is indeed one of the most perplexing
questions in intellectual history as to why
the scientific subculture developed in the
time and place that it did in Western Europe.
The common values that are prerequisite
to it are rather rare among human
subcultures. The common values, for instance,
of the military or the people that
run the international system are quite different
from those of science. In this sense,
therefore, science has an essential ethical
basis.

This means that even the epistemological
content of science, that is, what scientists
think they know, has an ethical component.
The proposition, for instance, that
water consists of two molecules of hydrogen
and one of oxygen is not usually
thought of as a proposition with high ethical
content. Nevertheless, any student in
chemistry who decides that he prefers to
think of hydrogen as dephlogisticated
water will soon find out that chemistry is
not just a matter of personal taste. The
fact that there is no dispute going on
about any particular scientific proposition
does not mean to say that it is a matter of
taste; it simply means that the dispute
about it has been resolved through the application
of certain common values and

ethical presuppositions.

There is however a fundamental sense
in which the epistemological process even


### ---Economics-1969-0-05.txt---
in the physical and biological sciences is
now running into situations which have
strong ethical implications outside the
scientific subculture. The myth that science
is simply discovering knowledge
about an objectively unchangeable world
may have had some validity in the early
stages of science but as the sciences develop
this myth becomes less and less
valid. The learning process of science is
now running into two serious difficulties.
The first might be called the generalized
Heisenberg principle. When we are trying
to obtain knowledge about a system by
changing its inputs and outputs of information,
these inputs and outputs will

change the system itself, and under some
circumstances they may change it radically.
My favorite illustration of the Heisenberg
principle is that of a man who inquires
through the door of the bedroom
where his friend is sick, "How are you?"
whereupon the friend replies "Fine," and
the effort kills him. In the social sciences
of course the generalized Heisenberg principle
predominates because knowledge of
the social sciences is an essential part of
the social system itself, hence objectivity
in the sense of investigating a world which
is unchanged by the investigation of it is
an absurdity.

The second difficulty is that as science
develops it no longer merely investigates
the world; it creates the world which it is
investigating. We see this even in the
physical sciences where the evolution of
the elements has now been resumed in this
part of the universe after some six billion
years. We are increasingly going to see
this in the biological sciences, which will
only find out about the evolutionary process
by actively engaging in it, and changing
its course. In the social sciences one
can defend the proposition that most of
what we can really know is what we create
ourselves and that prediction in social
systems can be achieved only by setting
up consciously created systems which will
make the predictions come true. Knowledge
of random systems can only be obtained
by destroying them, that is, by taking
the randomness out of them. There is
a great deal of evidence, for instance, that
the fluctuations of prices in organized
commodity or secuirity markets are essentially
random in nature. All we can possibly
discover therefore by studying these
fluctuations is what bias there might be in
the dice. If we want to predict the future
of prices in such a market we will have to
control it, that is, we will have to set up a
system of counterspeculation which will
guarantee a given future course of prices.
The gold standard is a primitive example
of such a system in which it is possible to
predict that the price of gold will lie
within the gold points as long as the system
remains intact. Similarly, we can predict
the inside temperature of a house
with an effective furnace and thermostat
much better than we can predict the
outside temperature simply because we
control one and not the other.
We cannot escape the proposition that
as science moves from pure knowledge toward
control, that is, toward creating
what it knows, what it creates becomes a
problem of ethical choice, and will depend
upon the common values of the societies
in which the scientific subculture is
embedded, as well as of the scientific subculture.
Under these circumstances science
cannot proceed at all without at least
an implicit ethic, that is, a subculture with
appropriate common values. The problem
exists in theory even in what might be described
as the objective phase of science,
that is, the phase in which it is simply investigating
"what is," because the question
of the conditions under which ignorance
is bliss is not an empty one. The assumption
which is almost universal in academic
circles that ignorance cannot possibly
be bliss might under some circumstances


### ---Economics-1969-0-06.txt---
be proved wrong by the very

methods of science itself. As long as science
is investigating an unchanging world,
however, this problem does not become
acute, for if knowledge does not change
the world, then all ignorance does for us is
to prevent us from satisfying our idle
curiosity. When, however, knowledge
changes the world the question of the content
of the common values, both of the
subculture which is producing knowledge
and of the total society in which that subculture
is embedded, becomes of acute importance.
Under these circumstances the

concept of a value-free science is absurd,
for the whole future of science may well
rest in our ability to resolve the ethical
conflicts which the growth of knowledge is
now creating. Science could create an ethical
dynamic which would bring it to an
end.

Let us return then to economics as a
moral science, not merely in the sense in
which all science is "affected with an ethical
interest," but in the quite specific
sense of asking whether economics itself
can be of assistance in resolving ethical
disputes, especially those which arise out
of the continued increase of knowledge.
Economics specializes in the study of
that part of the total social system which
is organized through exchange and which
deals with exchangeables. This to my
mind is a better definition of economics
than those which define it as relating to
scarcity or allocation, for the allocation of
scarce resources is a universal problem
which applies to political decisions and
political structures through coercion,
threat, and even to love and community,
just as it does to exchange. I have elsewhere
distinguished three groups of social
organizers which I have called the threat
system, the exchange system, and the integrative
system. Economics clearly occupies
the middle one of these three. It
edges over towards the integrative system
insofar as it has some jurisdiction over the
study of the system of one-way transfers
of exchangeables, which I have called the
"cgrants economy," for the grant, or oneway
transfer, is a rough measure of an integrative
relationship. On the other side,
economics edges towards an area between
the threat system and the exchange system
which might be described as the study
of strategy or bargaining.

To complete the circle there is also an
area, between the threat system and the
integrative system, of legitimated threat
which is the principal organizer of political
activity and the main subject matter
of political science. All these systems are
linked together dynamically through the
process of human learning which is the
main dynamic factor in all social systems.
Part of this learning process is the learning
of common values and moral choices,
without which no culture and no social
system is possible. The process by which
we learn otr preference structures indeed
is a fundamental key to the total dynamics
of society.

Economics, as such, does not contribute
very much to the formal study of human
learning, though some philosophical economists
like Frederick Hayek [4] have

made some interesting contributions to
this subject. Our main contribution as
economists is in the description of what is
learned; the preference functions which
embody what is learned in regard to
values, and the production functions
which describe the results of the learning
of technology. XVe may not have thought
much about the genetics of knowledge,
but we have thought about its description,
and this is a contribution not to be despised.


Thus, economics suggests the proposition
that actual choices depend not only
on preferences but on opportunities, and
that under some circumstances quite small
changes in either preferences or opportunities


### ---Economics-1969-0-07.txt---
may result in large changes in actual
choices made. This proposition applies
just as much to ethical choices and
common values as it does to private
tastes. It throws a good deal of light also
on what might be called the evolutionary
ecology of ethical systems. Successful ethical
systems tend to create subcultures,
and these subcultures tend to perpetuate
and propagate the ethical systems which
created them. This principle helps to explain
the persistent division of mankind
into sects, nations, and ideological groups.
If we were to map the ethical preference
systems of the individuals who comprise
mankind, we would not find a uniform
distribution but we would find a very
sharp clustering into cultures and subcultures
with relatively empty spaces between
the clusters. All the members of a
single sect, for instance, tend to think
rather alike in matters of ethical judgment
and differentiate themselves sharply
from the ethical judgments of other sects.
Individuals tend to be attracted to one or
another of these clusters, leaving the social
space between them relatively empty,
like space between the stars. The reasons
for this phenomenon lie deep in the dynamics
of the human learning process, for
our preferences are learned mainly from
those with whom we have the most communication.
This principle accounts for

the perpetuation of such clusters, though
it does not necessarily account for their
original formation, which exhibits many
puzzling phenomena. The splitting of
these clusters in a kind of mitosis is also
an important and very puzzling phenomenon.
Once we realize, however, that these
are highly sensitive systems as economic
analysis suggests, we can see how wide
divergences might arise. Thus, the actual
difference in preferences and even opportunities
between, shall we say, the socialist
countries and the capitalist countries,
may in fact be quite small, but this difference
is enough to produce a very wide
difference in the choices made.
Economics has made its own attempt to
solve some of the problems involved in the
moral judglnent in what we know as welfare
economics. I believe this attempt has
been a failure, though a reasonably glorious
one, and we should take a brief look
at it. Welfare economics attempts to ask
the question "What do we mean when we
say that one state of a social system is
better than another in strictly economic
terms?" The most celebrated answer
given is the Paretian optimum, which
states in effect that Condition A of a social
system is economically superior to
Condition B, if nobody feels worse off in
A than in B, and if at least one person
feels better off. "Better off" or "worse off"
are measured of course by preferences, so
that we could restate the condition as saying
that State A is superior to State B if
one or more persons prefer A and if nobody
prefers B. If we permit internal redistributions
within the system, that is,

compensation, the range of possible superior
states is considerably broadened.
From this simple principle a wide range of
applications has been found possible in a
stirring intellectual drama which might
well be subtitled "Snow White (the fairest
of all) and the Seven Marginal Conditions.
"

Many, if not most, economists accept
the Paretian optimum as almost self-evident.
Nevertheless, it rests on an extremely
shaky foundation of ethical propositions.
The more one examines it, for instance,
the more clear it becomes that
economists must be extraordinarily nice
people even to have thought of such a
thing, for it implies that there is no malevolence
anywhere in the system. It implies,
likewise, that there is no benevolence,
the niceness of economists not quite
extending as far as good will. It assumes
selfishness, that is, the independence of individual


### ---Economics-1969-0-08.txt---
preference functions, such that it
makes no difference to me whether I perceive
you as either better off or worse off.
Anything less descriptive of the human
condition could hardly be imagined. The
plain fact is that our lives are dominated
by precisely this interdependence of utility
functions which the Paretian optimum
denies. Selfishness, or indifference to the
welfare of others, is a knife edge between
benevolence on the one side and malevolence
on the other. It is something that is
very rare. We may feel indifferent towards
those whom we do not know, with whom
we have no relationships of any kind, but
towards those with whom we have relationships,
even the frigid relationship of
exchange, we are apt to be either benevolent
or malevolent. We either rejoice when
they rejoice, or we rejoice when they
mourn.

The almost complete neglect by economists
of the concepts of malevolence and
benevolence cannot be explained by their
inability to handle these concepts with
their usual tools. There are no mathematical
or conceptual difficulties involved in
inter-relating utility functions, provided
that we note that it is the perceptions that
matter [2]. The familiar tools of our
trade, the indifference map, the Edgeworth
box, and so on, can easily be expanded
to include benevolence or malevolence,
and indeed without this expansion
many phenomena, such as one-way transfers,
cannot be explained. Perhaps the
main explanation of ouLr neglect of these
concepts is the fact that we have concentrated
so heavily on exchange as the object
of our study, and exchange frequently
takes place under conditions of at least
relative indifference or selfishness, though
I argue that there is a minimum degree of
benevolence even in exchange without
which it cannot be legitimated and cannot
operate as a social organizer. We exchange
courtesies, smiles, the time of day
and so on with the clerk in the store, as
well as exchanging money for commodities.
The amount of benevolence which exchangers
feel towards each other need not
be large, but a certain minimum is essential.
If exchangers begin to feel malevolent
toward each other exchange tends to
break down, or can only be legitimated
under conditions of special ritual, such as
silent trade or collective bargaining.
Nevertheless, economists can perhaps
be excused for abstracting from benevolence
and malevolence, simply because
their peculiar baby, which is exchange,
tends to be that social organizer which lies
between these two extremes, and which
produces, if not selfishness, at least low
levels of malevolence and benevolence.
The threat system constantly tends to
produ-ce malevolence simply because of
the learning process which it engenders. A
threatener may begin by feeling benevolent
toward the threatened-"I am doing
this for your own good"-but threats almost
invariably tend to produce malevolence
on the part of the threatened towards
the threatener, and this is likely to
produce a type of behavior which will in
turn produce malevolence on the part of
the threatener towards the threatened.
This can easily result in a cumulative process
of increasing malevolence which may
or may not reach some kind of equilibrium.
The breakup of communities into
factions and into internal strife frequently
follows this pattern. At the other end of
the scale, the integrative system tends to
produce benevolence and those institutions
which are specialized in the integrative
system, such as the family, the
church, the lodge, the club, the aluimni association,
and so on, tend also to create
and organize benevolence, even beyond
the circle of their members. This is partly
because benevolence seems to be an importaint
element in establishing a satisfactory
personal identity, especially after the


### ---Economics-1969-0-09.txt---
threat system has been softened by the
development of exchange. Those who live
under threat, who generally occupy the
lower end of the social scale, as well as
those who live by threat at the upper end,
tend to find their personal identities
through malevolence and through the development
of counter-threat or through

the displacement of hatred onto weaker
objects, such as children and animals.
Once this state is passed, however, and society
is mainly organized by exchange,
there seems to be a strong tendency to
miove towards the integrative system and
the integrative institutions. The Rotary
Club is a logical extension of a businessoriented
society, but it is not one that
would necessarily have occurred to economists.


Oddly enough, it is not welfare economics
with its elegant casuistry, subtle distinctions,
and its ultimately rather implausible
recommendations, which has

made the greatest impact on the development
of common values and ethical propositions.
The major impact of economics on
ethics, it can be argued, has come because
it has developed broad, aggregative concepts
of general welfare which are subject
to quantification. We can see this process
going right back to Adam Smith, where
the idea of what we would today call per
capita real income, as the principal measure
of national well-being, has made a
profound impact on subsequent thinking
and policy. The development of the concept
of a gross national product and its
various modifications and components as
statistical measures of economic success,
likewise, has had a great impact in creating
common values for the objectives of
economic policy. Another, less fortunate,
example of a measure which profoundly
affected economic policy was the development
of the parity index by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics in the United
States Department of Agriculture. As a
measure of the terms of trade -of agricul.
ture, this became an important symbol.
"A hundred per cent of parity" became
the avowed goal of agricultural policy,
even though there is very little reason to
suppose that the terms of trade of a given
historic period, in this case the period
1909-14, have any ultimate validity as
an ideal. Because of differing rates of
change in productivity in different parts
of the economy, we should expect the
terms of trade of different sectors to
change. If, for instance, productivity in
agriculture rises faster than in the rest of
the economy, as it has done in the last
thirty years, we would expect the terms of
trade of agriculture to "worsen" without
any worsening of the incomes of farmers,
and without any sense of social injustice.
Even though economic measurement
may be abused, its effect on the formation
of moral judgments is great, and on the
whole I believe beneficial. The whole idea
of cost-benefit analysis, for instance, in
terms of monetary units, say "real" dollars
of constant purchasing power, is of
enormous importance in the evaluation of
social choices and even of social institutions.
We can grant, of course, that the
"real" dollar which is oddly enough a
strictly imaginary one, is a dangerously
imperfect measure of the quality of human
life and human values. Nevertheless,
it is a useful first approximation,
and in these matters of evaluation of difficult
choices it is extremely useful to have
some first approximation that we can then
modify. Without this, indeed, all evaluation
is random selection by wild hunches.
It is true, of course, that cost-benefit analysis
of all sorts of things, whether of
water projects, other pork barrel items, or
in more recent years weapon systems, can
be manipulated to meet the previous prejudices
of people who are trying to influence
the decisions. Nevertheless, the fundamental
principle that we should count


### ---Economics-1969-0-10.txt---
all costs, whether easily countable or not,
and evaluate all rewards, however hard
they are to evaluate, is one which emerges
squarely out of economics and which is at
least a preliminary guideline in the formation
of the moral judgment, in what might
be called the "economic ethic."
Nevertheless, the economic ethic, or the
total cost-benefit principle, is subject to
sharp challenge. Two principal criticisms
have been made of it, the first of which I
think is probably not valid, and the second
of which may be valid under limited
circumstances. The criticism that I think
is not valid is that cost-benefit analyses in
particular, or economic principles in general,
imply selfish motivation and an insensitivity
to the larger issues of malevolence,
benevolence, the sense of community
and so on. It is quite true, as shown
above, that economists have neglected the
problem of malevolence and benevolence.
Nevertheless, our attitudes towards others
can be measured at least as well as we can
measure other preferences, either by some
principle of "revealed preference" or by
direct questioning. It is entirely within the
competence of economics, for instance, to
develop a concept of the "rate of benevolence"
which is the quantity of exchangeables,
as measured in real dollars, which a
person would be willing to sacrifice in
order to contemplate an increase of one
real dollar in the welfare of another person.
If the rate of benevolence is zero, of
course, we have indifference or pure selfishness;
if the rate of benevolence is negative
we have malevolence, in which case
people need compensation in order to contemplate
without loss the increased welfare
of an enemy, or in reverse would be
willing to damage themselves in order to
damage another. The rate of malevolence
then would be the amount in real dollars
one would be prepared to damage one's
self in order to damage another person to
the extent of one dollar. These rates of
malevolence incidentally are frequently
quite high. It apparently costs the United
States about four dollars to do one dollar's
worth of damage in Vietnam, in which
case our rate of benevolence towards
North Vietnam is at least minus four. In
determining cost-benefit analysis we can
easily include rates of benevolence and
malevolence, adding the benefits and subtracting
the costs to those toward whom
we are benevolent, multiplied of course by
the rate of benevolence, and subtracting
the benefits and adding the costs, similarly
modifed, to those towards whom we
are malevolent.

The concept of a rate of benevolence, incidentally,
is at least a partial solution to
the perplexing question of interpersonal
comparisons of utility around which economists
have been doing a ritual dance for
at least three generations. Any decision
involving other people obviously involves
these interpersonal comparisons. They are
made, of course, inside the mind of the decision-
maker and what his rates of benevolence
or malevolence are likely to be is
determined by the whole social process in
which he is embedded. Surely something
can be said about this. We are, for instance,
likely to be more benevolent to
people who are going to vote for us and
perhaps malevolent to people who are
going to vote against us. The economic
theory of democracy indeed as developed
by Anthony Downs and others is a very
good example of what I have sometimes
called "economics imperialism," which is
an attempt on the part of economics to
take over all the other social sciences.
The second attack on the "economic
ethic" is more fundamental and harder to
repulse. This is the attack from the side
of what I have elsewhere called the "heroic
ethic" [1]. In facing decisions, especially
those which involve other people, as


### ---Economics-1969-0-11.txt---
virtually all decisions do, we are faced
with two very different framneworks of
judgment. The first of these is the economic
ethic of total cost-benefit analysis.
It is an ethic of being sensible, rational,
whatever we want to call it. It is an ethic
of calculation. We cannot indeed count
the cost without counting. Hence, it is an
ethic which depends on the development
of measurement and numbers, even if
these are ordinal numbers. This type of
decision-making, however, does not exhaust
the immense complexities of the
human organism, and we have to recognize
that there is in the world another
type of decision-making, in which the decision-
maker elects something, not because
of the effects that it will have, but
because of what he "is," that is, how he
perceives his own identity.

This "heroic" ethic takes three major
forms-the military, the religious, and the
sporting. The heroic ethic "theirs not to
reason why, theirs but to do and die" is so
fundamental to the operation of the military
that attempts to apply an economic
ethic to it in the form of cost-benefit analysis
or programmed budgeting, or even
strategic science as practiced by Herman
Kahn, T. C. Schelling, or even Robert
McNamara, are deeply threatening to the
morale and the legitimacy of the whole
military system. Religion, likewise, is an
essentially heroic enterprise, even though
there is a strong streak of spiritual costbenefit
analysis in it. The enormous role
which religion has played in the history of
mankind, for good or ill, is based on the
appeal which it has to the sense of identity
and the sense of the heroic even in ordinary
people. "Here I stand and I can do
no other" said Luther; "To give and not to
count the cost, to labor and ask for no reward"
is the prayer of St. Francis. "Do
your own thing" is the motto of our new
secular Franciscans, the Hippies. In our
national religion, President Kennedy said,
"Ask not what your country can do for
you, ask only what you can do for your
country." We find the same principle in
poetry, in art, in architecture, which are
constantly striving to disengage themselves
from the chilling embrace of costbenefit
analysis. I cannot resist quoting
here in full what has always seemed to me
one of the finest expressions in English
poetry of the heroic critique of economics
-Wordsworth's extraordinary sonnet on
King's College Chapel, Cambridge (Ecclesiastical
Sonnet, Number XLIII):

INSIDE OF KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL,
CAMBRIDGE

Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,
With ill-matched aims the Architect who

Of white-robed Scholars only-this immense
And glorious Work of fine intelligence!

Okay, boys, bring out your cost-benefit
analysis now! There is a story, for the
truth of which I will not vouch, that
Keynes once asked the chaplain of King's
College if he could borrow the chapel for
a few days. The chaplain was overjoyed
at this evidence of conversion of a noted
infidel until it turned out that Keynes had
got stuck with a load of wheat in the
course of his speculations in futures contracts

and wanted to use the chapel for

more," of course, is economics. I used to
think that high heaven rejected this because
its resources were infinite and therefore
did not need to be economized. I have
since come to regard this view as theologically
unsound for reasons which I cannot
go into lhere, but also for a more fundamental
reason. High Heaven, at least as it
exists and propagates itself in the minds
of men, is nothing if not heroic. The
power of religion in human history has
arisen more than anything from its capacity
to give identity to its practitioners and
to inspire them with behavior which arises
out of this perceived identity. In extreme
form, this gives rise to the saints and martyrs
of all faiths, religious or secular, but
it also gives rise to a great deal of quiet
heroism, for instance, in jobs, in marriage,
in child rearing and in the humdrum tasks
of daily life, without which a good deal of
the economy might well fall apart.
A good deal of the criticism of economics
from both left and right arises from
dissatisfaction with its implied neglect of
the heroic. There is a widespread feeling
that trade is somehow dirty, and that merchants
are somewhat undesirable characters,
and that especially the labor market
is utterly despicable as constituting the
application of the principle of prostitution
to virtually all areas of human life. This
sentiment is not something which economists
can neglect. We have assumed all
too easily in economics that because something
paid off it was therefore automatically
legitimate. Unfortunately, the dynamics
of legitimacy are more complex
than this. Frequently it is negative payoffs,
that is, sacrifices, rather than positive
payoffs, which establish legitimacy. It has
been the precise weakness of the institutions
that we think primarily of as economic,
that is, associated with exchange,
such as the stock market, the banking system,
organized commodity markets and so
on, as Schumpeter pointed out, that they
easily lose their legitimacy if they are not
supported by other elements and institutions
in the society which can sustain
them as integral parts of a larger community.
On the right also we find nationalists,
fascists, and the military, attacking
the economic man and economic motivation
from the point of view of the heroic
ethic. It is a wonder indeed that economic
institutions can survive at all, when economic
man is so universally unpopular.
No one in his senses would want his
daughter to marry an economic man, one
who counted every cost and asked for
every reward, was never afflicted with
mad generosity or uncalculating love, and
who never acted out of a sense of inner
identity and indeed had no inner identity
even if he was occasionally affected by
carefully calculated considerations of benevolence
or malevolence. The attack on

economics is an attack on calculatedness
and the very fact that we think of the calculating
as cold suggests how exposed

economists are to romantic and heroic
criticism.

My personal view is that, especially at
his present stage or development, man requires
both heroic and economic elements
in his institutions, in his learning processes
and in his decision-making and the
problem of maintaining them in proper
balance and tension is one of the major
problems of maturation, both of the individual
person and of societies. Economic
man is a clod, heroic man is a fool, but
somewhere between the clod and the fool,
human man, if the expression may be pardoned,
steers his tottering way.

Let me conclude by stealing another
idea from economics and applying it to
general moral science. This is the concept


### ---Economics-1969-0-13.txt---
of a production function, some sort of limited
relationship between inputs and outputs
as expressed in the great biblical
principle that grapes are not gathered
from thorns, or figs from thistles (Matthew
7:16). There are production functions
not only for grapes and figs, but also
for goods and bads, and indeed for the ultimate
Good. We dispute about what is
good, about what outputs we want as a result
of the inputs we put in. We dispute
also however about the nature of the production
functions themselves, what inputs
in fact will produce what outputs. In the
case of physical production functions the
problems can be resolved fairly easily by
experimenting, even though there are
some pretty doubtful cases, as in the case
of cloud seedings, which do not seem to be
demonstrably more effective than rain
dances. In the case of moral production
functions, however, the functions themselves
are much in dispute, and there may
indeed be more disputation about the production
functions than there is about the
nature of the desired outputs themselves.
I was impressed some years ago, when engaged
in a long arduous seminar with
some young Russians and young Americans
with how easy it was to agree on ultimate
goals, even across these widely divergent
ideologies, and how extraordinarily
hard it was to agree about the inputs
which are likely to produce these ultimate
goals.

There is a problem here in human
learning of how do we get to know the
moral production functions in the complex
melee of social, political, and economic
life, when it seems to be pervaded
throughout with a note of almost cosmic
irony in which almost everything we do
turns out different from what we expect
because of our ignorance, so that both the
bad and the good we do is all too often
unintentional. I cannot solve this enistemological
problem in one short paper, but
I recommend it as a major intellectual
challenge to the moral sciences. What I
am concerned with here is with economics
as an input into this moral production
function. Does economics, as George Stigler
has suggested, make people conservative
[3]? If so, it is perhaps because it
simply points out the difficulties and dangers
of heroic action and makes people appreciate
the productivity of the commonplace,
of exchange and finance, of bankers
and businessmen, even of the middle class
which our heroic young so earnestly despise.
Perhaps this is why so many young
radiCals today have abandoned economics
as a poisoned apple of rationality which
corrupts the pure and heroic man of their
identities and sympathlies. Economics is a
reconciler, it brings together the ideologies
of East and West, it points up the many
common problems which they have, it is
corrosive of ideologies and disputes that
are not worth their costs. Even as it acts
as a reconciler, however, does it not undermine
that heroic demand for social mutation
which will not be stilled in the
voices of our young radicals?

I confess I have been deeply disturbed
when I have asked myself these questions
and I have no easy answers to them. Nevertheless,
I am not sorry that I became an
economist, for to belong to a body of people
who have never even thought of introducing
malevolence into their social

theory is somehow in this day and age a
little cheering. The anxieties, the moral
anguish, and the intense dispute which
has racked the American Economic Association
this year and which is symbolized
by the question as to whether we should
move our meeting from Chicago is symptomatic
of the fact that not even the study
of economics can turn people into purely
economic men. Strangely enough it was
the mathematical economists and econometricians

who were most heroically

moved by a sense of outrage against their
personal identity, and who were least affected
by the cost-benefit analysis. In this
year of crisis I havte also learned something
about myself-that it is easier to
make heroic decisions as a member of the
committee than it is as a sole decisionmaker
and that heroism is much less appropriate
in political than it is in personal
decisions. The lessons of this year, therefore,
are that the study of economics does
not produce clods, even if perhaps the
American Economic Association does not
produce undue heroics. So we can hope at
least that economics is one of the inputs
that helps to make us human. If so, the
benefits of this strange activity will be
well worth its undoubted cost, even if in
our heroic mood we dare not calculate
them.

### ---Economics-1970-0-03.txt---
Much of mankind's accumulated knowledge
performs functions other than that of
increasing our command over goods and
services in the usual sense of these words.
The value of such knowledge is not instrumental
in an economic-technological

context. It is equally clear that contributors
to the growth of knowledge have all
along been motivated largely by a desire to
improve their understanding of the world
into which they were born. "From science
to engineering and from engineering to
more goods and services" would be an unduly
drab account of man's quest for knowledge.


Yet in societies of various types, financial
and other incentives have become
established for directing inventive and educational
abilities to specific tasks carrying
economic promise. Moreover, for several
centuries the Western conception of
knowledge that is valuable for its own
sake has been appreciably influenced by
the ideals of natural scientists and mathematicians.
It is a fact of crucial importance
that this has created a cultural environment
in which a reasonably high degree of
correlation may be found between the accumulation
of knowledge per se and subsequent
technological applications. The
methods of measuring the economic yield
of new knowledge and of measuring the
trend of that yield have many inevitable
limitations reflecting the indirectness of
the relation of the knowledge-acquisition
process to its economic consequences. My
paper will be concerned with these yields
and trends.

The inputs which in this study will be
regarded as progress-generating will be so
defined because they increase the economic
productivity of inputs at large. Our progress-
inputs could be viewed as producing
intangible capital that is instrumental to
the production of goods and services and
also intangible consumer capital serving as
a source of direct satisfaction. But this is
merely a simile because the properties of
this intangible investment militate against
treating it as output in the sense proper.
The "intangible investment" results in an
increase of the value of terms which in
static versions of neoclassical production
functions would be parameters. The progress-
generating inputs of each period may
then be viewed as producing additional
output indirectly, via their effect on such
terms of otherwise conventionally defined
production functions. In my appraisal,
interpreting the progress-generating inputs
of any period, and their immediate results,
in this distinctive fashion describes the
most convenient way of separating them
out for specific analysis.

As I shall show later, however, very
similar results are obtained in an analytical
framework of different character in
which practically all long-ruIn increase in
output per man-hour is interpreted as developing
from additional per capita knowledge.'


### ---Economics-1970-0-04.txt---
Even what in the usual neoclassical
model is considered mere factor-substitution
is in this alternative framework viewed
as implying the invention of new types of
goods, viz. of less labor-intensive equipment.
I will explain later why I will
merely keep an eye on the conclusions obtainable
from this construction which is
neither neoclassical nor Cambridgeian,
and why the main part of my analysis
will move in the framework usually referred
to as neoclassical.2 Objections raised
against the neoclassical models are quite
inconclusive in their present form, because
the question is not whether the assumptions
underlying such models are

"'realistic" (a good photograph of reality),
but whether in the real world these assumptions
are violated in such respects

and to such an extent as to render the
analytical results misleading. This the critics
have so far not even tried to show.
I. A Ratio of Benefit-Streamt to Cost and the
Corresponding Average Social

Rate of Return

The costs of generating progress consist
of the costs of producing new knowledge,
and the costs of increased per-capita knowledge-
distribution, and of the extra-costs of
chiangeovers from the use of old to the use of
new knowledge. This seems a reasonable
way of looking at our problem, because
if knowledge in use remained constant
per capita, the rate of progress would be
I In the case of the United States "practically all,"
because here terms-of-trade effects, the consequences of
improved diets, etc. play no major role. There remains
an ambiguity in connection with the consequences of
intersector shifts, on which see the discussion of the two
Kendrick measures in Section III.
2 To illustrate with the simplest kind of CobbDouglas
function applicable to the problem, as well as
this is possible for a single period (t= n):
Q(n) = F( E LR, E KR, LR(n), KE(n),
o o

LA(n), KA(n))L4(n)K$(n)

LR, KR = research-type inputs, in the broad sense.
LE(n), KE(n) = education (knowledge-distribution)
inputs which were applied in the past, or are being applied
in period n, to the labor force of period n, expressed
per capita of this labor force.
LA(n), KA(n) =inputs required for changing over to
improved industrial methods (mainly the obsolescencecomponent
of capital-replacement)..

Lc(n), Kc(n) = those inputs of period n not accounted
for in the argument of F, except that the education inputs
applied in period n to persons who are not yet
members of the labor force belong neither in Lc(n),
Kc(n) nor of course in the argument of F.
The algebraic form and the parameters of F depend on
factors not formalized in the equation, such as abilities
and habits of the population; policies other than those
expressing themselves in the R and E inputs; various
inputs in foreign economies; the relative weight of that
part of the old knowledge which remains useful when
new knowledge is acquired, etc. It will be seen later
that the convenient definition of the rate of technological
progress here is d In F/dt.

In this model avoidance of the implication of economies
of scale would require (3<1-a, instead of the
conventional (3=1 -a, but it may be preferable to face
the problem of such economies as one giving rise to the
qualifications discussed in the opening paragraph of
Section III.

The progress-generating inputs should be defined so
that if the variables in the argument of F assume the
values to which zero progress-generating input corresponds,
then d In F/dt=O (in which case, however,
JLc and IKc would be larger than at positive values of the
progress-inputs and of this derivative). Hence the progress-
generating inputs for period n consist of the
period's additions to the two E terms; and of the increase
of LB and KE expressed per capita of the labor
force of period n, as compared to the immediately preceding
period's Lg and KB expressed per capita of that
period's labor force; and of LA(n) and KA(n). In principle,
one of the magnitudes representing a progressinput
(increased per capita education) could turn out
to be negative, and avoidance of this awkwardness
would then call for some adjustments of terminology,
but in our context this may be disregarded.
If the methods of measuring progress call for limiting
Q to the private sector (usually including governmentowned
enterprise), then Lc and Kc should also be so
limited, but the argument of F should nevertheless include
also the public-sector inputs of the type specified
in the lines under the equation.
The larger cost-base to be defined in Section II involves
"charging" to the progress generated in a period
all progress-generating inputs for the period; the smaller
cost-base to be defined in Section II involves charging
merely the "profit-oriented" progress-inputs, which in
turn implies that the costs of the other progress-inputs
are recovered outside the market process and that the
progress-account should therefore be "credited" with
these nonmarket values.


### ---Economics-1970-0-05.txt---
zero. Whether we wish to distinguish the
specific costs of changeovers as a separate
subcategory is a terminological question,
since technological knowledge is not even
truly acquired before it is introduced on
an industrial scale. But at any rate the
changeover-costs belong among the costs
of progress, and they are quantitatively
significanit though they are frequently
overlooked when benefits are weighed
against costs. The costs of progress so conceived
are the costs of those inputs which
in this paper are referred to as "progressgenerating.
" These inputs become combined
with hiuman talent which is no easier
to define and is certainly no less essential
than are the Ricardian "original" and "indestructible"
powers of the soil.

We may express, as a proportion of the
value of a year's output, the cost of the
goods and services representing the progress-
generating input for the year; and on
the benefit-side, we may set against this
cost the proportion in which technological
progress increases the output flow annually.
3 On specific simplifying assumptions,
the progress-induced proportionate
addition to output will remain permanent
and independent of the output-base. With
a deduction on the productivity-side to
allow for the continuing need to keep per
capita education at any once-attained
higher level,4 we then arrive at the ratio of
an economic benefit-stream to cost; and
after multiplying by 100, we obtain a
magnitude that comes close to what the
economist may consider a measure of the
average social rate of return from the
progress-generating activities of the period
in question.6 Such a concept of an average
rate of return can not, of course, guide us
to the core of the ultimately relevant problems
of resource-allocation, but the concept
will nevertheless be found useful.
Even on assumptions assuring constant
proportionate additions to the output-flow
the delayed start of the benefit stream will
subsequently require allowances in the
nature of discounts, yet for reasons explained
in Appendix A and in Section VI,
this difficulty will not prove critical.6 We
will also have to try to get rid of the effect
of cyclical and erratic forces on our yearly
data.

The simlplifying assumptions required for
defining average social rates of return in
terms of constant proportionate additions
to output are indeed specific. But analysis
based on these assumptions has led to
reasonably realistic results in a good many
other respects. I shall make these assumptions
which should assure at least rough
comparability of the benefit-cost ratios so
obtained with analogous ratios for physical
capital formation on a more-or-less given
level of technological knowledge.7 The
"stepping up" of the absolute contribution
of technological progress when future inputs
(other than progress-generating ones)
raise the output-base must not be allowed
to destroy the comparability of progressreturns
with the returns from investment
in the usual sense. This must be watched
in formulating the assumptions needed for
the justification of such comparisons.


### ---Economics-1970-0-06.txt---
The required simplifying assumptions
are reasonably well satisfied in the macroeconomic
Cobb-Douglas framework. The

CES model also acquires the needed properties
if we work into it a mechanism of
induced invention and of distributiveshares
equilibrium.8 This is explained in
Appendix A. In Sections III and IV we
shall return to the question how much
similarity of the real world with such
models is implied in my paper.
I should add that on both sides of my
benefit-cost ledger I will have to disregard
problems of considerable importance which
either cannot be articulated sufficiently
well, or, if capable of articulation, can
be appraised only in very vague terms. I
will not be able to consider the question
whether all-too-rapid change does not reduce
our well-being "in a fundamental
sense," or, on the other hand, whether at a
stagnant or near-stagnant level of technology
the institutions of Western nations
would be workable at all. Nor will I try to
explore the relationship of technological
progress to population growth and to its
specific consequences.

II. Two Versions of the Social BenefitCost
Ratio, and their Meaning

A substantial part of the progress-generating
costs of each period is incurred by
decision makers subjected to the criterion
of private economic yield. The progresscosts
falling in this category consist mainly
of the costs of privately financed research
and development (R & D) and of the extra
costs of changing over to new industrial
processes. Though we are concerned here
with the problem of social yield, we should
obviously include these private yield-oriented
costs in the cost-base of our benefitcost
ratio.

Another large part of the progress-generating
expenses is incurred by agencies
not institutionally subjected to criteria of
economic yield. The government-financed
R & D9 and that financed by other nonprofit
institutions belong here, and so does
almost all of the cost of increased per
capita education.10 This does not mean
that the nonprofit institutions incurring
these costs are under no political or quasipolitical"
pressure to keep costs down per
unit of service; what it does mean is that
these costs create net income by definition,
i.e., that their net-income-creating property
does not depend on whether they
generate offsetting revenues. Nonprofit institutions,
most prominently illustrated by
governments, but illustrated also by private
teaching organizations, can have defcits
but these deficits are not usually
viewed as negative income such as would
cancel any part of the incomes created by
the institutions. In the language of national
accounting, the services of these institutions
are valued at cost, though, when
appraising the worth of the services, any
individual may find this valuation unconvincing.
In this regard such costs are

treated differently from those of firms,
e.g., differently from that R & D component
which is financed by industry.'2 The
8 See my December 1967 article which is listed in the
Reference section, as are the particulars of the other
references. The bibliography attached to that article
lists earlier writings of several authors on this subject
(including some by the present writer).
9 In the United States the greater part of the government-
financed R & D is performed on contract by industry.
The remainder of the government-financed component
is performed by the government itself and by
other nonprofit institutions (see Appendix D).
10 Training on the job in the business sector, and sales
of books, periodicals and newspapers to consumers
represent exceptions. These are institutionally profitoriented
expenditures. They do not weigh heavily in the
sum total of education costs in the broad sense (and, of
course, these items belong here only if education costs
are interpreted in the broad sense, as they should be for
our purpose).

11 By quasi-political pressure, I mean the pressure to
which trustees and administrators of private nonprofit
organizations are exposed and which they in turn exert
on the staffs of these organizations.
la Industry finances also some of the research performed
by universities and other nonprofit organiza-
tions but more than 98 percent of the R & D financed by
industry is also performed by it. (Continued)


### ---Economics-1970-0-07.txt---
costs of industry show in losses-in deductions
from net income-unless they are
recovered through revenue from sales in
markets.

This difference in accounting methods
corresponds to differences in the strength
of the argument for including the two
types of progress-generating expense in the
costs that make up the denominator of our
ratio of benefit-stream to costs. Where the
expenses need not be recovered through
revenues generated by them, groups of decision
makers were given legal authority to
proceed on the assumption that the knowledge
so produced or distributed has considerable
nonmarket value, i.e., value which
is not measured as part of the economic
benefit-stream. As a rule this is true even
where a nonprofit organization13 makes its
services available through sales in markets,
as is the case in a subsector of the education
sector. Even these nonprofit organizations
are heavily subsidized and/or the
acquisition of the type of service they offer
has been made compulsory by a political
decision limiting the market decision of the
customers to the choice of a source of
supply. The question arises therefore
whether the practice of valuation at cost
to the nonprofit institution, without regard
to recovery of the cost through revenue,
should for our purpose be taken at its face
value in the sense that we net out, and thus
exclude from the cost-side of our social
benefit-cost ledger, the costs of all items
that the national accountant treats as if
they created equivalent values by definition.
In a preliminary step let us do so,
but before trying to appraise the merits
and deficiencies of this version of our ratio,
let us take a look also at another way of
going about the matter.

We may, alternatively, decide to include
in our cost-base the costs of nonprofit institutions
along with those of the profitseeking
ones and thus obtain a ratio based
on all-inclusive costs. This ratio will, of
course, come out lower than the first.
We must remember, however, that even
the cost-base which we call "all-inclusive"
excludes items which are interpreted here
not as costs of progress-generating inputs
but as expenditures influencing the effectiveness
of such inputs.14 In the first
place, we shall have to limit ourselves to
the analysis of American data; hence the
costs incurred abroad belong among those
automatically excluded. Secondly, medical
expenses, other health-related components
of the consumer budget, and types of
public investment bearing on the effectiveness
of progress-generating inputs are
excluded (netted out) even from our larger
cost-base because it is implied that these
expenses become justified by the specific
output which they buy, aside from their
effect on productivity-gains. The same is
not "automatically" taken for granted for
any part of the input we define as progressgenerating.
No part of that input is excluded
from our larger cost-base, and while
part of it is excluded from our smaller
base, we emphasize that both bases require
attention in our analysis. Thereby we
leave a range open for personal (subjective)
valuation of the contribution of progressgenerating
inputs aside from their contribution
to measurable productivity

gains.

The proposition suggests itself that the


### ---Economics-1970-0-08.txt---
average social benefit-cost ratio which a
person is willing to accept as relevant to his
behavior as a voter, adviser, or administrator
is unlikely to fall significantly outside
the range bounded by the two ratios
we have defined. Our lower ratio involving
our all-inclusive cost-base completely
disregards the value of new knowledge
per se and also its instrumental value for
the performance of services made available
to the public through channels other than
those of the market. Our higher ratio involving
merely the costs of the institutionally
profit-oriented progress-inputs implies
that the given scale of the progress-generating
activities of governments and other
nonprofit organizations would be justifiable
even if these activities had no favorable
effect whatever on the market sector;
in view of the actual scale of these activities
in the contemporary American economy,
such a judgment would, I think, be
interpreted by most individuals as describing
valuation at, or near, the upper limit
of the range of reasonable valuations. Thus,
for what we may consider typical valuation,
our lower boundary seems convincing
as such, and our upper boundary seems
not far off the mark as such.

Can these propositions concerning alternatively
computed ratios of social benefit
stream to cost provide guidance for the
appraisal of the results of the American
progress-generating activities? I suggest
that the answer is in the affirmative,
though it must be recognized that an affirmative
answer implies a rather modest
interpretation of what it means to be
guided in one's behavior by an estimated
rate of return. Such a limitation is inherent
in any analysis that focuses on average
rates of return for successive periods. Yet
there is good reason for choosing this focus
in the central part of the present analysis.
We are concerned here with activities
for which the marginal social returns, and
hence the ultimately relevant social allocation
criteria, are not capable of being
estimated by examining private or national
accounts. Even with regard to the progressgenerating
inputs financed by profit-seeking
institutions, significant external effects
and shifts in competitive positions create
differentials between social returns and the
private marginal returns of the innovating
firms. For the diffusion of knowledge in the
market sector reduces their profits, while
gains in competitive position achieved during
the intervening period may prove enduring.
These gains increase the private
returns. At the same time, the spillover
effect of the progress-activities originating
in the nonprofit institutions expresses itself
in part in private market-returns. As
for the progress-generating activities of
nonprofit institutions, obviously there exists
no way of approximating from accounting
data the value of their nonmarket
contribution or that of their spillover effect
on the market economy. When appraising
marginal social returns each individual is
entitled to his own standards, and where
the problem is one of politically determined
inputs, individual valuations will not lead
to the quantity-adjustments which would
work toward equalization of returns at the
margin."5

In such circumstances only one statement
can be made about the marginal
criteria of desirable allocation on a reasonably
"objective" (or general) level of discourse.
The statement is that once a very
large number of individual preferences concerning
the ranking of the specific objectives
of the progress-activities have been bridged
16 As was pointed out above, in some sectors of the
progress-activities-particularly in a subsector of
"education"-political-type decisions, which greatly influence
the aggregate quantity of resources used for a
general purpose, nevertheless leave room for the individual'
s market-choices as to the specific quantities of
service acquired from alternative suppliers. I consider
extension of the range of such choices desirable but
whatever the range is (or might become) its existence
does not contradict the statements in the text.


### ---Economics-1970-0-09.txt---
by political or quasipolitical compromise, it
is in the common interest of the community
to avoid waste. The content of the
political compromise plays a significant
role in shaping the waste-avoidance problem
with which the private as well as the
public sector is faced. Given some specific
compromise on the priority-rankings, the
avoidance of waste requires the solution of
technical problems that are far from trivial
from a professional point of view. Yet any
substantive suggestion on how to satisfy
the marginal criteria of socially desirable
allocation for the progress-inputs inevitably
implies distinctly personal preferences
which need to be reconciled with the
preferences of others. Preferences of this
sort are essentially preferences of an individual
for one variety of political compromise
("as if" utility function) rather
than another."6

This very high degree of subjectivity
does not attach to all substantive propossitions
that may be developed on the yield
of the progress-effort. It is possible to suggest
substantive propositions not only
about the average social rate of return
from each period's progress-activities but
also about tlle algebraic sign of the difference
between the average and the marginal
social rate to which a much lesser
degree of subjectivity attaches. Event if an
individual were in a position to exert decisive
influence on the composition of the
progress-generating inputs-or if for any
reason he ideiitified himself fully with politically
determined priority-rankings-he
would still be apt to find a considerable
gap between the average and the marginal
social rates from the progress-activities of
a period, provided that these activities are
pursued on a significant scale. The gap
between average and marginal rates develops
because high talent shades over
into lesser talent, and because the solution
of problems is an inherently sequential pro.
cess. This is ain essential property-we
may perhaps say a Schumpeterian property
-of the progress-generating activities. By
way of "transitivity," the following propositions
follow from the average-marginal
gap in the progress activities:
a) Each person has reason to consider it
a necessary condition of his approval of a
set of allocative decisions that by his
standards the average social rate of return
from the progress-activities should exceed
the marginal social rate of return from
physical investment "at a given level of
technological knowledge";

b) the necessary condition requires also
that the average rate of progress-return
should exceed the marginal market rate
from the current flow of physical investment,
since we may assume that this

market rate is no higher than the marginal
social rate from physical investment;
c) finally, no undue stretching is involved
in extending this condition to the
requirement that the average rate of progress-
return should exceed the rate of return
on the capital stock-say, the algebraic
product of the share of capital in income
with the ratio of yearly output to
capital"7-since we may assume that normally
this rate is not very different from
the marginal market rate on physical investment.


It therefore seems reasonable to conclude
that from each individual's point of
view it is a necessary condition of good
allocation that by his standards the average
social rate of return from the progressgenerating
activities of the successive

periods should tend to exceed the profit
rate on physical capital, i.e., should exceed
the rate which in traditional theory is interpreted
as the net marginal productivity


### ---Economics-1970-0-10.txt---
of capital. About the relationship between
the average rate from the progress-activities
and the conventionally estimated marginal
product of capital it is possible to
make reasonably "objective" numerical
statements, though unfortunately not very
precise ones, because some statements that
can be made about the average rates from
the progress-activities imply merely value
judgments that are very widely shared.
In particular, a great many individuals
would agree that an unduly strict criterion
of overall social profitability, and
hence of required average social rates of
return, is set by charging the full cost of
the knowledge-acquisition activities of
governments and of teaching and research
institutions to measured productivity
trends, as if the nonmarket contribution
of these activities were zero. At the
same time, most individuals would, I
think, agree that it is useful to inquire into
the question of average social rates of return
also by valuing the nonmarket contribution
of the politically or quasi-politically
determined progress-inputs at full
cost to the nonprofit institutions as if no
favorable effect on the market-sector were
required to justify these inputs on their
present scale. I surmise that the valuation
convincing to most persons would be located
either within, or not significantly
outside, the range described by these two
frames of reference for valuation. In this
sense, our two benefit-cost ratios describe a
range which should be of some use to most
decision makers, particularly because the
usefulness of the framework is admittedly
limited. A verdict of social profitability as
expressed by adequate average rates of
return is compatible with anyone's personal
judgment that the progress-activities
could be made even more profitable by
changing the controversial content of
political compromises concerning the composition
of the inputs. While the present
paper will not lose sight of these highly
controversial questions involving marginality,
I will try to separate these from
the problems that can be analyzed on a
reasonably "objective" level. In practice,
this objectivity becomes reduced by the
need to fill in gaps in the available data by
operations that at times become very
speculative.

More ambitious contributions of other
authors are revealing in many ways but
they do not remove the limitations we
need to observe in our present context. For
example, from empirical investigations one
may conclude that additional educationeducation
at the margin-is profitable by
market criteria alone, even without regard
to socially desirable external effects and to
the nonmarket value which is acquired.'8
This is a significant result, and it has important
applications, but it cannot be put
to use in our present analysis. Additional
education is profitable very largely be
cause our technology is becoming increasingly
complex, a process which in turn
presupposes additional education. Recognition
of this takes us back to the problem
of the social worth of the activities that
lead to the increasing complexity of our
technological and organizational methods.
III. The Residual: A Roundabout Way of
Measuring Productivity-Increases
The method here to be used for estimating
productivity gains leads to higher
estimates than do some procedures that
have occasionally been suggested. Yet I
feel that the method needs to be defended
not so much against methods that attribute
a smaller component of growth to
progress, but against methods that attribute
to progress an even larger growthcomponent.
As concerns the United States,
an argument could be made for the view
that practically all long-run increase in
output per man-hour (or possibly more
than this) involves invention and/or
18 See particularly Gary S. Becker.


### ---Economics-1970-0-11.txt---
additional knowledge-distribution because
even insofar as the neoclassical approach
attributes a growth-component to mere
factor-substitution-i.e., insofar as physical
investment exceeds the equivalent of
mere "widening"-such investment presupposes
the invention of new equipment
of lesser labor-intensity.'9 Practically all
long-run increase of output per man-hour
(and even the prevention of some decrease
resulting from land-scarcity) requires at
least some amount of additional per capita
knowledge which may or may not express
itself in the production of new types of
equipment20; the reverse proposition that
making use of new ideas requires new capital
goods is hazy because new capital goods
result from new ideas applied to already
existing types of equipment. If one wanted
to follow through consistently the implications
of the conception that all long-run
increase in man-hour output reflects technological
progress, one would arrive at even
higher productivity-gains than those which
we shall assume (though at more costly
ones); the progress-generated productivity-
gains so defined would show a rising
tendency, as will ours; and these progressgains
too would point to high but somewhat
declining rates of social return, similar
to ours.2' We will not follow through all
the implications of this "inclusive" conception
of progress though one of its several
implications will be carried over into the
framework I am using because in mine, too,
economies of scale will become merged
with "progress." My main reason for not
following through all the implications of
the most inclusive conception is that some
possible ways of increasing man-hour
output require new ideas only in a very
modest sense of this term, i.e., require
merely somewhat trivial new ideas (resulting
in slow changes of the physical
composition of the capital stock). Thisis
what in my appraisal justifies the "neoclassical"
procedure of attributing part of
the increase in output per man-hour to
changes in input-proportions aside from
technological progress. But this way of
looking at the problem still leaves one with
a preference for principles that lead to
higher progress-estimates than do the principles
suggested in some other contributions
to growth theory.

My analysis will rely on the method of
the Residual as it is employed by John
Kendrick for measuring the proportionate
rate of increase of productivity. From this
productivity-increase I will derive the
magnitude I consider the benefit resulting
from the progress-generating costs.
As is well known, the method of the
Residual attributes to technological advance
that increase in output which is not
attributed to the increase in physical
inputs given their base-period productivities.
The measurement of productivity assumes
measurement of the price-corrected market


### ---Economics-1970-0-12.txt---
value of output, and in the United States
this is practically the same thing as to say
that we are concerned here with a Residual
observed as a proportion of the privately
produced output.22 The procedure has the
implication that the analysis of the determinants
of technological progress is as
yet in a tentative stage, so that if for example
R & D, the increase of per capita
education, the extra-inputs needed for
industrial changeovers, and some other
items to be discussed in this paper make up
the identifiable progress-inputs (as I
suggest they do), we cannot at present
expect good results from regressing output
on all these specific inputs along with the
conventional inputs specified in the production
functions. I feel convinced that
realism does require recognizing this limitation
but that this does not mean that we
are left with no good argument for relating
the Residual to the inputs and costs I
defined as progress-generating.
Regression analysis of cross-sections of
individual industry groups and of firms
enabled investigators to obtain confirmation
of the hypothesis that productivityincreases,
as estimated by the method of

the Residual, are positively correlated with
R & D-intensity.23 On the other hand,
spillover effects from the public into the
private sector, the diffusion of knowledge
within the private sector, and the narrowness
of the concept of R & D-intensity
as compared to our concept of progressgenerating
input make it desirable to ask
the question of the relationship of the
Residual to progress-inputs also in broader
intertemporal terms. When the question is
so posed, it calls for exploring whether the
time-sequence of productivity increases, as
measured by the Residual, bears an understandable
relation to the time-sequence

of progress-generating inputs. We shall see
that this is indeed the case, but in such
work there is at present only limited room
for regression analysis and for "testing" in
the technical sense. This is because for
some purposes for which time-sequence
comparisons of productivity increase with
inputs are used it is advisable to rely on a
rather small number of typical values of
the variables for successive periods of
considerable duration; high serial correlation
and lags reduce the usefulness of data
reflecting yearly changes.24 Emphasis will
22 However, the base in relation to which the pro-
ductivity-increase is measured is somewhat inflated as a
result of the fact that the private sector includes some
activities for which no productivity-increase can be
measured (such as the activities of private nonprofit
organizations, and paid household work); and it includes
some activities for which the output indices
actually used do not measure productivity-increases
adequately. A minor terminological awkwardness to be
noted here is that government-enterprise, in contrast to
general government, belongs in the "private" sector
See also fn. 33.

23 Kendrick (pp. 182-186) has found a statistically
significant correlation between the increase in his total
factor productivity and the "R & D-intensity" of
specific industry groups. His discussion of this problem
is based partly on his own research and partly on that of
Nestor Terlecky.

Jora Minasian in his May 1969 article, and in his
earlier work there quoted, reports on a positive re-
lationship between R & D and productivity-increase in
a cross-section of chemical firms. He regressed Value
Added on labor, capital and R & D. His estimate of the
rates of return from R & D disregards a substantial
proportion of the progress-costs with which we shall be
concerned in this paper, but what matters here is the
existence of a positive relationship between R & D and
productivity-increase. However, the fact that on the
cost-side merely R & D enters into Minasian's analysis
when he estimates rates of return may provide part of
the explanation why these rates are hard to reconcile
with the results of a survey (questionnaire study) on
which Edwin Mansfield reported also in the May 1969
Papers and Proceedings. Firms must be acutely aware
of the changeover costs and of various other costs to
be considered in our analysis.
24 This, however, is not all "black and white." For
example, regression analysis based on yearly data is not
useless when it comes to examining the question whether
in the United States the rate of increase of productivity
has been rising.

Testing the upward tendency of the rate of produc-
tivity increases (semi-logarithmic nonlinearity) with
yearly data is of interest only for the period following
1919 (or conceivably for a period ending in 1919).
Kendrick has shown conclusively that if one decides to
limit oneself to semi-logarithmically linear relations of
productivity to time (i.e., of the logarithm of productherefore


### ---Economics-1970-0-13.txt---
be placed on tendencies observable
by comparing typical data for a
limited number of consecutive periods, and
importance will be attributed to the fact
that when the Residual is used as a point of
departure for estimating benefits, and the
costs are defined as those of our progressgeneratinog
inputs, the benefit-trends and
cost-trends show a fairly consistent relationship
that "makes sense."

The method of the Residual can be employed
in different ways. Kendrick has
measured a magnitude he calls total factor
productivity, this being a productivity
measure from which he excludes the consequences
of allocational shifts among sectors
(his industry groupings). Hence here the
shifts, which in fact have favored the
higher-productivity sectors (industry
groups), are made to express themselves as
increases of weighted physical inputs rather
than of productivity. Further, Kendrick
has measured a magnitude which he calls
"output per unit of total input" and which
differs from his "total factor productivity"
only in that it registers the results of the
intersector shifts as productivity-increases
rather than as increase of weighted inputquantity.
Both concepts relate to the private
domestic economy.

Both measures used by Kendrick register
larger productivity-increases than those
consistent with the usual two-factor classroom
models, because his input-estimates
include estimates of farm land and of real
estate (site land) as part of his estimate of
capital. The relative fixity of this input
reduces the growth-rates of physical inputs,
thus increasing the Residual. Aside
from this, some technical considerations
suggest that, by their own standards, the
Kendrick measures of productivity-gains
err somewhat on the high side but other
considerations point in the opposite direction.


From 1900 to 1929, factor productivity,
including the favorable effect of intergroup
shifts, rose at an annual compound
rate of 1.8 percent (during the last ten
years of the period it rose at 2.0 percent);
from 1929 to 1948 the rise occurred at the
rate of 2.3 percent; from 1948 to 1966 at
2.8 percent, with no acceleration during
these past eighteen years. If we exclude
from the productivity-increase the favorable
effect of Kendrick's intergroup shifts,
we obtain somewhat smaller productivity
increases but broadly similar trends for
these, except that some further acceleration


### ---Economics-1970-0-14.txt---
is observed for the comparison of
1957-1966 with 1948-1957.25 Kendrick's
published series end with estimated values
for 1957, but I made use of his somewhat
revised figure for 1957 and of his figures for
later years, i.e., of unpublished data he
kindly let me see, though with emphasis
on their preliminary character.
Thus, from the period 1929-1948 to the
present, the rate of increase of productivity
has risen by about 20 percent of itself; or
by about 30 percent, if the effects of the
intergroup shifts are excluded from the
productivity-increase. From the opening
decades of the century to the present, the
rate of productivity-increase has risen by
about 60 percent (a figure which becomes
75 percent with exclusion of the intergroup
shifts) .26

Indications of a rising tendency of the
rate of productivity-increase are consistent,
though the rise is small as compared
to the rise of the recorded progress-generating
inputs, particularly of R & D, in
relation to output. The discrepancy becomes
significantly reduced by reasonable
allowance for progress-inputs that are not
recorded as such.

IV. The Framework for Productivity and
Benefit Measurement: How Serious
are its Pitfalls?

1. Using the All-Inclusive Cost-Base Requires
a Deduction on the Productivity-Side.
We start with a pitfall for the avoidance
of which a definite prescription can be
given. If we say, as we do when using our
all-inclusive cost-base, that productivityincreases
cost us inter alia the inputs

needed for increased per capita education,
then we are implying that on the benefitside
the bulk of this particular cost must
be deducted from the productivity-increases.
The reason is that a once-attained
higher level of per capita education must
subsequently be maintained to keep the
level of knowledge from becoming reduced.
In this regard the characteristics of education
are different from those of R & D or
from those of the costs of changeovers.
What needs to be deducted on the benefit-
side is the "bulk" of the cost that had
been entered for education-not the entire
cost-because we are relating our magnitudes
to output, and constancy per unit of
the population means a gradual reduction
per unit of output. However, on reasonable
quantitative assumptions the "discounted
value" of the difference between these two
growth rates is small, and hence I will
indeed deduct the bulk.27

2. The Embodiment-Disembodiment Issue,
the Quality-Quantity Controversy and the
Importance of "Dimensions of Improvement.
"'

We shall now consider the main problem
of the present section. Our reasoning can
be Dlaced into frameworks of different
25 On this basis the following results are obtained:
from 1900 to 1929 the rise was 1.5 percent (for the subperiod
1919-29: 2.0 percent); from 1929 to 1948 it was
2.0 percent; from 1948-57 it was 2.3 percent; and for the
following nine years 2.6 percent.
26 Dension, who has made an attempt to separate
quantitatively the effect of different sources of growthan
attempt which because of interactions between his
"sources" I am inclined to consider too ambitiousused
his estimates also for explaining what results he
would obtain by a method much more similar to that of
Kendrick and of other investigators. It turns out that
from the period 1909-29 to 1929-47 he would obtain a
45 percent rise of the rate of productivity-increase. See
Edward F. Denison, pp. 148-49.
27 If progress were limited to a brief interval, then
not merely the "bulk" but, for practical purposes, all of
the cost-item entered for increased per-capita education
would have to be deducted on the benefit-side of the
ledger. The increase in per capita output resulting
merely from, say, a 2 percent yearly increase of the
capital-labor ratio "at a given level of technology"
would require a negligible correction of the kind described
in the text. But if we consider a very long sequence
of periods with technological progress and assume,
say a 2 percent yearly increase in per capita output
then, with a 10 percent discount rate, roughly
four-fifths (or a shade less) of the cost-item entered for
increased per capita education should be deducted on
the benefit-side. I will in fact deduct about four-fifths,
with some rounding where this is called for (see fn. 40,
for the calculation of the 1966 and the 1953 yield).


### ---Economics-1970-0-15.txt---
kinds as long as these have enough in
common with the models discussed in
Appendix A. For us the essential property
of these constructs is that they are models
of disembodied progress in which the
elasticities of output with respect to the
inputs are reasonably well approximated
by the distributive shares of the inputs,
and in which distributive shares remain
reasonably stable. To the extent that these
assumptions are unrealistic our analysis
needs to be adjusted, and in Section III, I
have already pointed out that one type of
adjustment does not change the conclusions
very much. What should we think of
the "disembodiment" implication of our
framework, i.e., of the implication that
progress leads inter alia to the production
of new types of goods rather than depends
on new equipment?

Models of so-called embodied progress do
not seem convincing to me on logical
grounds, and to my knowledge, no claim of
empirical superiority has been made, let
alone established, for these frameworks. As
I said, all progress is necessarily disembodied
in the sense that new ideas must
always be put into effect with reliance on
the initially given resources. This is an
essential constraint under which all economies
operate. Improved production with
the initially given resources then leads to
more and better capital goods-hence to
the replacement of old with superior equipment
and structures ("obsolescence")-
and it yields more and better consumer
goods. But all this represents forward, not
backward, embodiment.

For various purposes it has proved rewarding
to interpret progress as "factoraugmenting"
; yet even if progress is interpreted
as purely capital-augmenting, this
alone does not change the framework into
one of embodied progress. Using a framework
in which some input is "augmented"
merely means expressing the productivityincrease
of that input as the equivalent of a
specific quantity-increase and expressing
the productivity-increases of other inputs
as resulting from complementarity. No
empirical superiority has been claimed for
this degree of unilateral emphasis on
capital-i.e., for assuming pure capitalaugmentation-
but at any rate more is

needed for obtaining "embodiment," in a
distinctive sense of the term.
If the embodiment hypothesis is not to
lose what I consider its essential characteristic,
the additional assumption must be
made that each period's capital-goods
output can become subject merely to a
single dose of augmentation which describes
a specific level of technology; and
that only the next period's capital goodsthe
next vintage-can become subject to
the next dose. This, I submit, is an unconvincing
assumption if we take into

account why next period's capital goodsnext
period's equipment-models-are superior
to this period's equipment-models.
They are superior because this period's
initially given equipment-models and labor
perform better than how these inputs
would have performed without the new
ideas. So why should the possibilities with
a period's capital goods-a given vintage
become exhausted during a specific period
for which a specific level of technological
knowledge is defined? If the possibilities do
not become exhausted in this fashion, then
a level of technological knowledge ceases
to be uniquely described by (or embodied
into) a specific vintage of capital goods.
In the absence of strong empirical support
for the hypothesis of pure capitalaugmentation
and of the required additional
assumption, I have fewer misgivings
about disembodiment than about embodiment.
Yet while so-called embodiment
makes too much of the role of new physical
capital formation in bringing about progress,
disembodiment implies overlooking
its progress-promoting effect which probably
does exist. The existence of this effect


### ---Economics-1970-0-16.txt---
complicates matters, and I shall soon
return to this difficulty.

We must be mindful also of another
property of the framework here employed.
We are implying, as does the method of the
Residual in general, that it is advisable to
try to translate quality-improvements of
consumer goods into additional quantities
and yet to express productivity-increases
of capital goods and of inputs in general as
quality-improvements for given physical
quantities.

In my appraisal there is no reason to
become disturbed about this lack of symmetry
between the interpretation of improvements
of inputs and that of improvements
of consumer goods. The alternative
would be that of lumping together our
"progress-generating inputs" with the
other inputs, and of interpreting the research
worker not as one who increases the
productivity, and hence the quality of the
inputs with which measured output is
produced, but as one who has the same
kind of productivity in the production of
measured output as do (say) production
workers.28 However, for my present purpose
it would be wrong to cut the story
short in this fashion. I am concerned with
the question how the social yield of progress-
inputs compares with that of other
inputs, and this concern calls for placing
emphasis on the indirectness with which
the progress-inputs produce additional
measured oUtput.29 Thus, for the present
purpose it is useful to have a framework
in which the progress-inputs increase the
" quality" of the other inputs and in which
the other inputs produce quantities of
output.

In practice the effort to let the productivity-
increases of inputs express themselves
in quality-changes for given physical
quantities, and to translate the qualityimprovements
of consumer goods into

quantities, gives rise to many procedural
difficulties and the methods for taking care
of these are admittedly very imperfect. In
particular, it has been argued that the
quantitative allowances for the improvement
of consumer-good quality are not
only very crude (which they certainly are),
but in all probability also insufficient. In a
general way it makes good sense to suspect
that the allowances are quantitatively
insufficient, but we should nevertheless
note that the standard of living of Western
countries is rising rapidly, and it is particularly
true at higher levels of income
that the market basket illustrates instances
of consistent quality-deterioration
as well as of improvement. Nevertheless,
for consumer goods I shall make an allowance
for the assumed underestimate of net
quality improvement (see Appendix C).
Last but not least, an inevitable imperfection
of frameworks of the kind here
employed results from two-way interactions
between physical capital formation
and technological progress. As I said above,
my misgivings about the method by
which vintage models deal with this relationship
does not mean that I consider it
harmless to disregard the interactions.
Starting with initially given resources,
the chances of substantial and continued
improvement are undoubtedly greater if
the processes used are rich in changeable
properties-i.e., in what I elsewhere called
dimensions of improvement-than if these
processes offer improvement possibilities
only in a few directions; and the use of a
large variety of instruments of production
opens up a large number of dimensions of
potential improvement. In another study
I found strong indications that the results
of learning-by-doing are significantly influenced
by differences in the available
28 See Zvi Griliches and Dale Jorgensen.
29 Looking at the matter in this fashion is of course
compatible with using models that represent progress
as the "augmentation" of inputs. Indeed, models of
this sort usually draw a sharp distinction between "inputs
measured in physical units" and "inputs measured
in (augmented) efficiency units."


### ---Economics-1970-0-17.txt---
number of dimensions of improvement.30
So physical capital formation helps the
improvement process, if for no other reason
than because it increases the number
of directions in which improvement can
proceed. The interaction is mutual: we
have seen that without any technological
progress whatever, net physical capital
formation could not exceed the equivalent
of the growth of other inputs because less
labor-intensive machines are different machines.
Some readers might therefore prefer
the alternative framework outlined at
the outset of Section III (see also fn. 21).
On the whole, I do not believe that we
would become guilty of gross error by disregarding
these mutual interactions when
using our framework for distinguishing
between progress-generating activities and
physical investment provided we stay
aware of the fact that large changes in the
scale on which either of these activities is
pursued have implications for the conditions
under which it is possible to engage
in the other type of activity. Of this we
must remain aware.

V. Progress-Generating Inputs and Costs:
The Significance of the

"Unrecorded" Items3"

From 1953 to 1966 total recorded R & D
rose from $5.2 billion to $22.2 billion, and
this represents a better than twofold inincrease
when R & D is expressed as a

proportion of the privately produced
GNP. This proportion rose from 1.6 percent
to 3.3 percent.32 While an appreciable
part of this increase was "real"-i.e.,
"physical"- considerable importance attaches
to changes in relative values.
The question of the weight of the realinput
component versus the relative-valuation
component of the increase of the ratio
of R & D-cost to private GNP is discussed
quantitatively in Appendix B. This question
is of some importance because the
relative-valuation component represents
in part rent-formation-a mere transfer of
income-rather than a rise of social costs.
However, in any event, even the relativevaluation
component represents in good

part rising social costs, because the relatively-
rising salaries of research workers
(and also of teachers) have attracted into
the progress activities individuals whose
qualifications and productivity would be
higher also in other occupations. This must
have been the driving force of the transfer.
Such a phenomenon is accompanied by
rent-formation, but I suspect that in the
progress-activities-particularly in reseach
and higher education-the rent-formation
accompanying the rise of social costs is
smaller than in the types of activity mostly
referred to when the nature of the transferrent
problem is illustrated.33


### ---Economics-1970-0-18.txt---
We have just seen that from 1953 to
1966 the ratio of total recorded R & D cost
to private GNP rose by more than 100
percent. For the period 1929-1953 only
sporadic and incomplete data are available,
but there is good reason to conclude
that during this period there occurred a
very significant increase of R & D inputs in
relation to real private GNP, and that in
terms of undeflated values the increase was
even more substantial than in real terms
(see Appendix B). These increases are out
of line with the rise of the rate of productivity-
increase. The latter is a 60 percent
or, at most, a 75 percent increase even if we
go back to 1900-1929 and thus compare
the pre-1929 period with the present.34
The efficiency of the edutcational complement
of research would to some extent
become adjusted to the requirements set
by new knowledge-production even if
per capita knowledge inputs did not rise in
quantity. In reality the quantity of these
inputs has risen appreciably. Partly from
HEW data and partly from those of Fritz
Machlup, I infer that from the calendar
year 1953 to 1966 the cost of increased per
capita education rose from the equivalent
of 0.3 percent of private GNP to the
equivalent of about 0.5 percent (see Appendix
B). Increased education works itself
out with significant lags, but an appreciable
rate of increase dates back far
into the past. Therefore, trend-appraisals
are not appreciably distorted if we associate
0.3 percent with the 1953 benefit, and
0.5 percent with the 1966 benefit, though
the levels of the rates of progress-return
are somewhat distorted-i.e., are calculated
as if the lag did not exist-a fact that
need not disturb us much because the
smaller cost of the past, which in view of
the lag would represent a more appropriate
present charge, arose correspondingly
earlier and for that reason should be
viewed as the equivalent of more than the
undiscounted figure suggests.35
As for the industry-financed (institutionally
profit-oriented) R & D, this rose
from $2.2 billions in 1953 to $7.2 billions in
1966. When expressed in relation to private
GNP we obtain a rise from 0.7 percent to
1.1 percent. In Appendix B it is shown that
the post-1953 rise of this particular proportion
is likely to have been mainly (perhaps
entirely) the result of the increase in the
relative prices of R & D inputs. That is to
say, here the relative-valuation component
accounts for practically the entire effect,
while for total R & D, the real-input component
also was significant (even for 1953-
1966).

Regardless of whether we are interested
in yields on our all-inclusive cost-base or in
yields on a cost-base limited to institutionally
yield-oriented progress-inputs, exclusive
concern on the cost-side with

recorded R & D and with increased per
capita education would lead to the twin
conclusions that yields have been declining
steeply and that they nevertheless still are
at a "perplexing" level. Such calculations
are misleading because they disregard the
fact that obsolescence in the conventional
sense, as well as some costs of a character
similar to that of obsolescense, and also
some costs of a different kind, are omitted
from the recorded progress-generating costs.
This is so even if for the present purpose we
regard the education costs in Machlup's
broadened sense as "recorded." Many of
the unrecorded costs, including obsolescense
itself, fall in the category which in
Section I, I called costs of changeovers to
gress-sectors are the favored ones the significance of
this phenomenon is reduced by the fact that the labor
force of research establishments is far from homogene-
ous. The reason why a high proportion of these workers
is facing increasingly favorable market conditions is
that a high proportion is gradually improving its qualifi-
cations which are getting to be considered increasingly
valuable also in other occupations.

of the growth rate of the output base.

new methods. Their weight is substantial,
but for a given rate of technological progress
these costs are unlikely to change
much in relation to private GNP. Hence
allowances for these costs reduce not
merely the rates of return but also their
downtrend.

It is easy to become misled into the
belief that the method of the Residual
automatically implies proper recognition
of obsolescence. In a sense it does recognize
obsolescence but it does not do so in the
sense relevant to our problem. The method
is not intended to, and it does not, take
account of the fact that in any of the "base
periods" with which the "present period"
is compared, the now old technology was
new.36 Hence at that time the now old
technology gave rise to obsolescence and
it required various instrumental activities
that represented costs of changing over to
new methods. These costs would not have
been incurred in the base-period and they
would not be incurred now if there had
been no technological advance in either
period. In a continuously progressing
economy the inputs used for the obsolescence-
component of capital-replacement
are continuously withheld from the production
of consumer goods or from net

investment (or from the public-sector
counterparts of these). 37

A list of the items that may be regarded
as unrecorded costs is presented in Appendix
C, along with explanations. In spite
of the large number of items on the list,
we may take it for granted that only one
item-conventional obsolescence-corresponds
individually to an appreciable proportion
of private GNP. As for the other
items, in some cases it is doubtful whether
they have a legitimate place on the list and
at any rate, even their joint weight cannot
be appreciable when expressed in relation
to private GNP. Among the items listed
in Appendix C there are only a few that
would be suspect, even at first sight, of
possessing large weight. Item 5 of the
Appendix-the cessation of learning-bydoing
with the old equipment and for the
old product when new methods are introduced-
belongs among the suspects, but
in reality it is unlikely to be of great quantitative
importance because in each period
the discarded methods are apt to be those
for which learning-by-doing has largely
run its course. Item 6-the technical imperfections
of recording-must have been

large in the early decades, but we are concerned
here mainly with the post-1953
period, and our few references to pre-1953
periods were based on attempts to get
indirectly at what now would be "recorded"
R & D. For the present purpose I shall
assume that a deliberately high estimate is
obtained of the joint weight of the unrecorded
costs other than obsolescence in the
usual sense if these other costs are put
at 2 percent in relation to private GNP;
and that a deliberately low estimate is
obtained by putting these items at 1 percent.


What mainly matters is obsolescence in
the usual sense. The fact that we consider a
component of capital consumption a cost
even though we are moving in a GNP
framework may seem paradoxical, but for
no good reason, because while for our
periods GNP may safely be used as a
proxy for NNP, we must take into account
that if capital consumption had all along
been smaller, then any given GNP would
have been a proxy for a higher NNP.
Experts have repeatedly expressed the
view that practically all of the capital
consumption and replacement, which corresponds


### ---Economics-1970-0-20.txt---
to more than 10 percent of GNP,38
reflects obsolescence, i.e., a result of technological
progress. Such a statement needs
to be reinterpreted for our purpose. If the
service lives of capital goods were to be
prolonged significantly, then, unless the
equipment-goods and the construction
industry were to raise their costs and selling
prices for the sake of durability, the
users of capital goods would be spending
more on repairs and maintenance. The
question here is: how much more? This, I
believe, has remained an unexplored question
which would deserve a research effort.
In the absence of dependable information,
I suggest two guidelines for the present
purpose. I will base my subsequent reasoning
more on the second than on the
first of these.

1) By assuming that total capital consumption
typically amounts to about 12

percent as expressed in relation to private
GNP, and by charging one-fourth of this to
technological advance for obsolescence, one
is unlikely to overcharge the progressaccount.
One way of visualizing the implications
of a charge of such size-3 percent
of private GNP-is to note that it is
consistent with the hypothesis that in
order to arrive at a doubling of the useful
service lives, the users of capital goods
would have to increase their present expenditures
on current repairs and maintenance
by the equivalent of about 50

percent of what would then become their
reduced current capital-consumption cost.39
For structures which represent a very
weighty component of the capital stock,
this is quite likely to be an overstatement
of the costs of extending the now usual service
lives, hence an understatement of the
costs to be set against technological advance
and against the rise of living standards
in which it expresses itself. The same
may be true of some types of equipment,
but there undoubtedly exist types for
which these numerical assumptions understate
the costs of the extension of service
life, and thus overstate the cost of progress.
On the whole, charging 3 percent of private
GNP is unlikely to err (or to err much) on
the high side of costs, and this charge
might well err on the low side. As long as
we try not to overcharge we may add
merely 1 percent of the private GNP for
unrecorded costs other than obsolescence,
i.e., for the other costs listed in Appendix C.
We arrive at 4 percent of private GNP for
what I consider a "moderate" estimate of
the unrecorded costs, though I will not
build much on this figure.

2) An immoderate overstatement of the
obsolescence-cost of progress would be
obtained by charging to progress the
entire capital-consumption-i.e., about 12
percent of private GNP-and by adding 2
38 From 1919 to 1955 Kuznets' capital consumption
allowances move in the range from 10.9 to 15.1 in relation
to GNP (constant prices); at the beginning and
also at the end of the period the figure was almost precisely
in the middle of the range. This implies Kuznets'
Variant III of output. Using other Variants of Kuznets,
wider ranges are found for movements of the depreciation
ratio in the region above 10 percent. See Kuznets'
Appendix A, Table R-2, p. 487.
The capital-consumption ratio implied in the Capital
Stock Study of the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Office of Business Economics seems to be somewhat
smaller than Kuznets', but also typically somewhat
higher than 10 percent. See for this e.g. Robert C. Wasson'
s articles in the Survey of Current Business, particularly
in the December 1966 and in the February 1969
issue. However, proper interpretation of the relationships
here considered requires also use of computer
output available from Mr. Wasson's office. My evaluation
implies a reasonable "blowing up" of the Commerce
Capital Stock Study depreciation figures, in view of the
fact that the figures of the Study relate only to the
business sector including farms, i.e., exclude the residential
sector as well as general government. I was using
the Capital Stock Study's straight-line depreciation
estimates and was using them on "Cost 1" basis. This
cost-basis makes the method of deflating comparable to
that applied to the Commerce estimates of the GNP.
39 Any hypothesis of this kind has the realistic impli-
cation that in a progressive economy the "representa-
tive" physical asset is produced in such a way as to be
in some sense "too durable." This has several reasons,
one of which presumably is that lack of durability is
not the only unfavorable property of a "flimsy object."


### ---Economics-1970-0-21.txt---
percent for the other unrecorded costs,
thus obtaining a charge corresponding to
14 percent of private GNP. But it will
prove to be important to take a look also
at the progress-yields obtained on this
immoderate assumption. I will build on
the fact that the 14 percent charge is excessive
by a significant margin.

VI. Levels and Trends of "Objective" Yields
and Observations on Matters Calling
for Subjective Appraisal

The method by which the quantitative
yield-appraisals were obtained is based
on the discussion in Sections III and V
and the details are explained in the footnote
below.40 Note that on the productivity-
side we rely on Kendrick's estimate of
annual productivity-increase including the
effect of intergroup shifts (2.8 percent),
but the reader can convince himself that
the result would be influenced little by
the use of estimates that exclude the intersector
effect (for the most recent period
this would have been an increase of 2.6
percent p.a.). To me it seems reasonable to
relate also the intersector effect to progress-
generating inputs.41

Many statements one would like to be
able to make about these results would be
much too risky for presentation. But there
are two statements which I consider to be
safe.

The first of these is that the present
average social rate of return from the
progress-activities is substantially in excess
of 13 percent on the all-inclusive
cost-base, and substantially in excess of
18 percent on the cost-base limited to
institutionally profit-oriented progress-inputs
("reduced" cost-base). The rates of
13 percent and of 18 percent would imply
charging all capital consumption to progress,
as if extension of service-life were
entirely costless ad infinitum except for
continued maintenance costs at the now
usual level. If we charged one-fourth of the
capital consumption to progress, and made
a moderate charge also for other unrecorded
costs, we would obtain a 31 percent
rate of return on the all-inclusive cost-base,
and a 55 percent rate on the reduced costbase.
These particular charges rest on


### ---Economics-1970-0-22.txt---
guesswork (I believe of a plausible kind),
but it may be regarded as a fact that 13
percent and 18 percent understate the
average rate of progress-return by a substantial
margin and this will prove significant
for the present analysis.

The second statement I consider to be
reasonably safe is that the rates of return
show some degree of downward tendency
in the long run (see here also Appendix B).
The qualifications one might want to add
to this statement are not sufficiently
persuasive to arouse much suspicion in the
diagnosis that such a tendency is observable,
though I would not want to assert
that my figures give an accurate idea of
the extent to which a downtrend has manifested
itself. On what I defined as the reduced
cost-base this downward tendency
has been very mild, but it would not
entirely disappear on any cost-base that to
me seems reasonably chosen.

The suggestion of a long-run downward
tendency of the average rate of return is
not misleading, because the long-run increase
of the costs of progress-inputs has
all along exceeded the rise of the productivity-
gains when both are expressed in
relation to the same output-base. In particular,
the approximately constant uptrend
of productivity during the post-war
decades has been associated with increasing
progress-costs even if we consider
merely the costs of the privately financed
progress-inputs. The second half of the
present decade does not fit well into the
pattern, but it is too early to try to interpret
the record of the very recent inflationary
years, not only because the rate of
resource-utilization in the American economy
has risen suddenly but also because
the rate of increase of the progress-inputs
has been tapering off. This tapering off
occurred partly because the rate of increase
of space research tapered off and
then space research reached a peak in 1966;
and partly because even more recently
there also took place anti-inflationary
downward revisions of government programs
(which is not to say that the rate of
increase of R & D might not have declined
even aside from these circumstances).
Consequently it is to early to ask whether
in the mid-sixties the downward tendency
of our benefit-cost ratios was or was not
interrupted, but further productivityincreases
would have to assume a very

unlikely course to invalidate the conclusion
that there did occur some degree of
long-run decline, even with reasonable
allowances for lags.

We should note that the downward
tendency of the progress-yields would be
slightly smaller than our figures suggest if
we assumed a small rise of the rate of
increase of factor productivity from 1953
to 1966. In fact there is valid reason for
assuming a small acceleration of progress
but, as concerns the downward tendency
of the yields, allowance for this would
make little difference, because such a
modification would call at the same time
for a small increase of our charge for the
unrecorded costs.42

42 I assumed a 2.8 percent rate of increase of factor
productivity for the entire period 1948-66. This is in
accordance with the Kendrick estimates when the favorable
productivity-effects of intersector (intergroup)
shifts are included. On this basis there was no increase
from 1948-57 to 1957-66. However, if the effect of these
shifts is excluded, then from 1948-57 to 1957-66 a rise
is observed from a rate of increase of 2.3 percent to a
rate of 2.6 percent. Furthermore, even the first of these
two types of measure of productivity-increase rose from
the period 1929-48 to 1948-66 (it rose from 2.6 percent
to 2.8 percent), and it may be argued that this rise has
resulted in part from the post-1953 increase in progress-
inputs.

When comparing 1966 with 1953 I took no account
of any such increase on the benefit-side of the ledger. I
also used the same percentage allowance in relation to
private GNP for the unrecorded costs of 1966 as for
those of 1953, since there exists a general presumption
that these costs tend to move in proportion to the rate
of progress. During these particular thirteen years there
may conceivably have occurred a somewhat more than
proportionate increase in specific costs appearing in the
list of Appendix C. One may be led to suspect this for
example because of the increase of the white-colla
proportion of the labor force. On the other hand, the


### ---Economics-1970-0-23.txt---
A downtrend of rates of return in the
progress-generating activities is, of course,
not the same phenomenon as the previously
discussed gap between the average
and the marginal rate on the progressinputs
of single periods; the downtrend
over time calls for a different interpretation.
It may be interpreted as meaning
that researchers, teachers and other workers
engaged in knowledge-acquisition and
distribution activities of growing complexity
have increased the efficiency of their
own group somewhat less than would have
been required for unchanging performance
at unchanging costs. Even the relativevaluation
(or relative-wage) component of
a downtrend can in good part be so interpreted,
because while this component

becomes enlarged by rent-formation, it
nevertheless is true that the relative increase
of the incomes of progress-workers
typically results from the need to use very
highly qualified personnel on a rising
scale."' Trying to avoid a downtrend
of the rates of return on these particular
inputs by limiting the scale of the progressactivies
of each successive period accordingly
would in the long run prove incompatible
with a nondiminishing rate of technological
advance in the economy at large.
In view of the scarcity of the ultimate resources
needed for any economic processincluding
the process of self-improvement
of progress-workers-a secular downward
tendency of yields should indeed be expected,
and Kenneth Arrow was right in
reminding us at last year's annual meeting
that "eternal exponential technological
growth is just as unreasonable as eternal
exponential population growth."44 But it is
equally true and important that such a
slow, secular downward tendency of the
progress-yields may become interrupted
for very long periods. Recurring "breakthroughs"
play an important role in the

history of the sciences.

Quite aside from the question of a downward
tendency with the actually observed
composition of the progress-activities, we
should recall that, given the present scale
of these activities, even a person in full
agreement with the community-decisions
concerning composition would in all probability
have to consider the marginal social
rates of return of each period lower than
our average rates. This gap arises partly
because high-quality personnel is limited,
and partly because the solution of problems
presupposes the solution of earlier ones.
The least promising project of any period
is apt to be appreciably less promising
than the period's average project. But as
I said in Section II, I am abstaining here
from efforts to apply formal analysis to the
problem of marginal rates, since each individual
is entitled to his own marginal
calculus and in most of the area in which
this paper has been moving individual
valuations become submerged in compromise
rather than become validated at the
margin by means of purchase, sale and
production.45 This is why I have so far


### ---Economics-1970-0-24.txt---
focused on average rates of return and on
"necessary conditions," using what I believe
to be very widely shared assumptions
as to the meaning of low and of high valuation
of controversial nonmarket contributions.


At this point, attention should be directed
at those aspects of our problem
which call for highly subjective judgment.
My illustrations will be found in Appendix
D, which contains observations on significant
structural and allocational problems
within the area of R & D. Prominent
among these problems is that of "concentration"
in several senses of this term. As
for educational policy, it has become all too
obvious that the future of Western civilization
depends on the personal attitudes
millions of individuals will develop to
structural problems belonging in that sector
of the progress-generating activities.
We may now return to our point of departure.
As long as we want to remain on a
level of reasonable objectivity, we can only
try to play into the hands of those who
must make their own value judgments. On
alternative cost-bases it is possible to make
reasonable statements of fairly general
validity on the social profitability of the
progress-generating activities as a whole
and on the trends of this profitability. For
the time being the average social yields
are high on both our cost-bases, very much
higher than 13 percent and 18 percent,
respectively, as was seen. It should of
course not be overlooked that a waiting
period of considerable duration elapses between
some progress-generating inputs and
the onset of their yield. But this is true
only of part of the progress-inputs as we
have defined them. Furthermore, when
comparing these yields with yields from
plhysical capital formation, another lagadjustment
is also needed, and as explained
in Appendix A, this works in the
opposite direction (in favor of the progressinputs)
. We should remember also that
while on the one hand the lag between
progress-inputs and their results would call
for upward revaluation of the inputs in
relation to their results, on the other hand,
earlier progress-inputs have all along been
smaller progress-inputs.

At any event, regardless of what lagadjustment
we make within reason, the

average social rate of return-even the
rate on the all-inclusive cost-base-satisfies
our necessary condition with ease. This
"real rate" is at present much higher than
the marginal rate from physical investment
at a more or less given level of knowledge.
The latter rate should be estimated
at less than 10 percent; a good case can be
made for estimating it at a figure located
in the range between 5 percent and 10 percent.
46 Moreover, the rates on progressinputs
suggested by our analysis are appreciably
higher also than the typical pretax
corporate profit-rates, a fact which is
worth noting even though no comparability
is claimed for our rates of return with
accounting profits.47

46 A rough estimate of the rate in question, which is
obtained by way of multiplying the ratio of yearly output
to the capital stock by the share of reproducible
capital in income, points to less than 10 percent. See
Section II.

47 The published corporate profit rates (which are
related to the book value of equity) are of course private
rather than social rates. This would not make too much
difference if the private rates were rates "at a given
level of technological knowledge" but in reality they
are earned partly on private progress-generating inputs
which do not enter into the book value. Also, in contrast
to our "real" rates these corporate rates are money
rates earned in large part on equity such as has been
paid up or accumulated in much earlier years than those
in which the profits were earned. There are several
further reasons for noncomparability. On balance there
exists a strong presumption that the corporate rates on
book value are considerably higher than the real rates
on physical investment. The published pre-tax profit
rate on the book value of American manufacturing
corporations as a whole has of late been about 20 percent,
and even this is less than the rates of progressreturn
to which our calculations in the text point.
Again with no claim to comparability, it may be added
that the earnings-rate on the market value of Standard
and Poor's common-stock sample (not wholly limited
to manufacturing) is in the neighborhood of 6 percent,


### ---Economics-1970-0-25.txt---
For an appreciable period to come, even
a slow downtrend of the progress-yields
would leave a significant differential between
the average social rate of return
from the progress-activities and the conventionally
defined marginal rate of return
from physical investment. One is
tempted to add that, given the size of this
differential, it should be possible to promote
the gradual shifting of a larger proportion
of our inputs into the various progress-
activities without forcing the marginal
social rates on these below the marginal
rates on physical investment (the latter
being an activity which does not come in
fixed proportions with technological progress)
. In my appraisal, this statement, too,
makes very good sense. But even if most
people should agree with this statement,
and yet there should be substantial disagreement
on the nature of the projects

that satisfy the marginal criteria, the possibility
of increasing the weight of the newknowledge
sector would still depend on

how well the political mechanism is capable
of bridging the differences. In view of
this, I will end with a question in bargaining
theory: Is it realistic to expect that the
propensity to reach compromises can be
increased by making the bargaining parties
aware of the fact that the joint payoff on
reaching agreement is high?
 ## Economics-1971-0


### ---Economics-1971-0-03.txt---
Economics today rides the crest of
intellectual respectability and popular
acclaim. The serious attention with which
our pronouncements are received by the
general public, hard-bitten politicians, and
even skeptical businessmen is second only
to that which was given to physicists and
space experts a few years ago when the
round trip to the moon seemed to be our
only truly national goal. The flow of
learned articles, monographs, and textbooks
is swelling like a tidal wave; Econometrica,
the leading journal in the field
of mathematical economics, has just
stepped up its publication schedule from
four to six issues per annum.

And yet an uneasy feeling about the
present state of our discipline has been
growing in some of us who have watched
its unprecedented development over the
last three decades. This concern seems to
be shared even by those who are themselves
contributing successfully to the
present boom. They play the game with
professional skill but have serious doubts
about its rules.

Much of current academic teaching and
research has been criticized for its lack of
relevance, that is, of immediate practical
impact. In a nearly instant response to
this criticism, research projects, seminars
aind undergraduate courses have been
set up on poverty, on city and small town
slums, on pure water and fresh air. In an
almost Pavlovian reflex, whenever a new
complaint is raised, President Nixon appoints
a commission and the university
announces a new course. Far be it from
me to argue that the fire should not be
shifted when the target moves. The trouble
is caused, however, not by an inadequate
selection of targets, but rather by our
inability to hit squarely any one of them.
The uneasiness of which I spoke before is
caused not by the irrelevance of the practical
problems to which present day economists
address their efforts, but rather by
the palpable inadequacy of the scientific
means with which they try to solve them.
If this simply were a sign of the overly
high aspiration level of a fast developing
discipline, such a discrepancy between ends
and means should cause no worry. But I
submit that the consistently indifferent
performance in practical applications is in
fact a symptom of a fundamental imbalance
in the present state of our discipline.
The weak and all too slowly growing empirical
foundation clearly cannot support
the proliferating superstructure of pure, or
should I say, speculative economic theory.
Much is being made of the widespread,
nearly mandatory use by modern economic
theorists of mathematics. To the
extent to which the economic phenomena
possess observable quantitative dimensions,
this is indisputably a major forward
step. Unfortunately, any one capable of
learning elementary, or preferably advanced
calculus and algebra, and acquiring
acquaintance with the specialized terminology
of economics can set himself up as a
theorist. Uncritical enthusiasm for mathematical
formulation tends often to conceal


### ---Economics-1971-0-04.txt---
the ephemeral substantive content of
the argument behind the formidable front
of algebraic signs.

Professional journals have opened wide
their pages to papers written in mathematical
language; colleges train aspiring
young economists to use this language;
graduate schools require its knowledge and
reward its use. The mathematical modelbuilding
industry has grown into one of the
most prestigious, possibly the most prestigious
branch of economics. Construction of
a typical theoretical model can be handled
now as a routine assembly job. All principal
components such as production functions,
consumption and utility functions
come in several standard types; so does
the optional equipment as, for example,
"factor augmentation"-to take care of
technological change. This particular device
is, incidentally, available in a simple
exponential design or with a special automatic
regulator known as the "Kennedy
function." Any model can be modernized
with the help of special attachments. One
popular way to upgrade a simple one-sector
model is to bring it out in a two-sector version
or even in a still more impressive form
of the "n-sector," that is, many-sector
class.

In the presentation of a new model,
attention nowadays is usually centered on
a step-by-step derivation of its formal
properties. But if the author-or at least
the referee who recommended the manuscript
for publication-is technically competent,
such mathematical manipulations,
however long and intricate, can even without
further checking be accepted as
correct. Nevertheless, they are usually
spelled out at great length. By the time it
comes to interpretation of the substantive
conclusions, the assumptions on which the
model has been based are easily forgotten.
But it is precisely the empirical validity
of these assumrptions on which the usefulness
of the entire exercise depends.
What is really needed, in most cases, is
a very difficult and seldom very neat
assessment and verification of these assumptions
in terms of observed facts. Here
mathematics cannot help and because of
this, the interest and enthusiasm of the
model builder suddenly begins to flag:
"If you do not like my set of assumptions,
give me another and I will gladly make you
another model; have your pick."
Policy oriented models, in contrast to
purely descriptive ones, are gaining favor,
however nonoperational they may be.
This, I submit, is in part because the
choice of the final policy objectives-the
selection and justification of the shape of
the so-called objective function-is, and
rightly so, considered based on normative
judgment, not on factual analysis. Thus,
the model builder can secure at least some
convenient assumptions without running
the risk of being asked to justify them on
empirical grounds.

To sum up with the words of a recent
president of the Econometric Society,
" . . . the achievements of economic theory
in the last two decades are both impressive
and in many ways beautiful. But it cannot
be denied that there is something scandalous
in the spectacle of so many people
refining the analysis of economic states
which they give no reason to suppose will
ever, or have ever, come about.... It
is an unsatisfactory and slightly dishonest
state of affairs."

But shouldn't this harsh judgment be
suspended in the face of the impressive
volume of econometric work? The answer
is decidedly no. This work can be in
general characterized as an attempt to
compensate for the glaring weakness of
the data base available to us by the widest
possible use of more and more sophisticated
statistical techniques. Alongside the
mounting pile of elaborate theoretical
models we see a fast-growing stock of
equally intricate statistical tools. These


### ---Economics-1971-0-05.txt---
are intended to stretch to the limit the
meager supply of facts.

Since, as I said before, the publishers'
referees do a competent job, most modeltesting
kits described in professional
journals are internally consistent. However,
like the economic models they are
supposed to implement, the validity of
these statistical tools depends itself on the
acceptance of certain convenient assumptions
pertaining to stochastic properties of
the phenomena which the particular
models are intended to explain; assumptions
that can be seldom verified.

In no other field of empirical inquiry has
so massive and sophisticated a statistical
machinery been used with such indifferent
results. Nevertheless, theorists continue
to turn out model after model and mathematical
statisticians to devise complicated
procedures one after another. Most of these
are relegated to the stockpile without any
practical application or after only a perfunctory
demonstration exercise. Even

those used for a while soon fall out of favor,
not because the methods that supersede
them perform better, but because they
are new and different.

Continued preoccupation with imaginary,
hypothetical, rather than with
observable reality has gradually led to a
distortion of the informal valuation scale
used in our academic community to assess
and to rank the scientific performance of its
members. Empirical analysis, according to
this scale, gets a lower rating than formal
mathematical reasoning. Devising a new
statistical procedure, however tenuous,
that makes it possible to squeeze out one
more unknown parameter from a given
set of data, is judged a greater scientific
achievement than the successful search
for additional information that would
permit us to measure the magnitude of the
same parameter in a less ingenious, but
more reliable way. This despite the fact
that in all too many instances sophisticated
statistical analysis is performed on a
set of data whose exact meaning and
validity are unknown to the author or
rather so well known to him that at the
very end he warns the reader not to take
the material conclusions of the entire
''exercise" seriously.

A natural Darwinian feedback operating
through selection of academic personnel
contributes greatly to the perpetuation of
this state of affairs. The scoring system
that governs the distribution of rewards
must naturally affect the make-up of the
competing teams. Thus, it is not surprising
that the younger economists, particularly
those engaged in teaching and in academic
research, seem by now quite content with a
situation in which they can demonstrate
their prowess (and incidentally, advance
their careers) by building more and more
complicated mathematical models and
devising more and more sophisticated
methods of statistical inference without
ever engaging in empirical research. Complaints
about the lack of indispensable primary
data are heard from time to time,
but they don't sound very urgent. The
feeling of dissatisfaction with the present
state of our discipline which prompts me
to speak out so bluntly seems, alas, to be
shared by relatively few. Yet even those
few who do share it feel they can do little
to improve the situation. How could they?
In contrast to most physical sciences, we
study a system that is not only exceedingly
complex but is also in a state of constant
flux. I have in mind not the obvious change
in the variables, such as outputs, prices or
levels of employment, that our equations
are supposed to explain, but the basic
structural relationships described by the
form and the parameters of these equations.
In order to know what the shape of
these structural relationships actually are
at any given time, we have to keep them
under continuous surveillance.
By sinking the foundations of our analytical


### ---Economics-1971-0-06.txt---
system deeper and deeper, by

reducing, for example, cost functions to
production functions and the production
functions to some still more basic relationships
eventually capable of explaining
the technological change itself, we should
be able to reduce this drift. It would,
nevertheless, be quite unrealistic to expect
to reach, in this way, the bedrock of invariant
structural relationships (measurable
parameters) which, once having been
observed and described, could be used
year after year, decade after decade, without
revisions based on repeated observation.


On the relatively shallow level where the
empirically implemented economic analysis
now operates even the more invariant
of the structural relationships, in terms of
which the system is described, change
rapidly. Without a constant inflow of new
data the existing stock of factual information
becomes obsolete very soon.

What a contrast with physics, biology or
even psychology where the magnitude of
most parameters is practically constant
and where critical experiments and measurements
don't have to be repeated every
year!

Just to keep up our very modest current
capabilities we have to maintain a steady
flow of new data. A progressive expansion
of these capabilities would be out of the
question without a continuous and rapid
rise of this flow. Moreover, the new, additional
data in many instances will have to
be qualitatively different from those provided
hitherto.

To deepen the foundation of our analytical
system it will be necessary to reach
unhesitatingly beyond the limits of the
domain of economic phenomena as it has
been staked out up to now. The pursuit
of a more fundamental understanding of
the process of production inevitably leads
into the area of engineering sciences. To
penetrate below the skin-thin surface of
conventional consumption functions, it
will be necessary to develop a systematic
study of the structural characteristics and
of the functioning of households, an area in
which description and analysis of social,
anthropological and demographic factors
must obviously occupy the center of the
stage.

Establishment of systematic cooperative
relationships across the traditional
frontiers now separating economics from
these adjoining fields is hampered by the
sense of self-sufficiency resulting from what
I have already characterized as undue reliance
on indirect statistical inference as
the principal method of empirical research.
As theorists, we construct systems in which
prices, outputs, rates of saving and investment,
etc., are explained in terms of
production functions, consumption functions
and other structural relationships
whose parameters are assumed, at least for
arguments' sake, to be known. As econometricians,
engaged in what passes for

empirical research, we do not try, however,
to ascertain the actual shapes of these
functions and to measure the magnitudes
of these parameters by turning up new
factual information. We make an about
face and rely on indirect statistical inference
to derive the unknown structural
relationships from the observed magnitudes
of prices, outputs and other variables
that, in our role as theoreticians, we
treated as unknowns.

Formally, nothing is, of course, wrong
with such an apparently circular procedure.
Moreover, the model builder in
erecting his hypothetical structures is free
to take into account all possible kinds of
factual knowledge and the econometrician
in principle, at least, can introduce in the
estimating procedure any amount of what
is usually referred to as "exogenous"
information before he feeds his programmed


### ---Economics-1971-0-07.txt---
tape into the computer. Such

options are exercised rarely and when they
are, usually in a casual way.

The same well-known sets of figures are
used again and again in all possible combinations
to pit different theoretical models
against each other in formal statistical
combat. For obvious reasons a decision is
reached in most cases not by a knock-out,
but by a few points. The orderly and
systematic nature of the entire procedure
generates a feeling of comfortable selfsufficiency.


This complacent feeling, as I said before,
discourages venturesome attempts to
widen and to deepen the empirical foundations
of economic analysis, particularly
those attempts that would involve crossing
the conventional lines separating ours from
the adjoining fields.

True advance can be achieved only
through an iterative process in which improved
theoretical formulation raises new
empirical questions and the answers to
these questions, in their turn, lead to new
theoretical insights. The "givens" of today
become the "unknowns" that will have to
be explained tomorrow. This, incidentally,
makes untenable the admittedly
convenient methodological position according
to which a theorist does not need
to verify directly the factual assumptions
on which he chooses to base his deductive
arguments, provided 'his empirical conclusions
seem to be correct. The prevalence
of such a point of view is, to a large extent,
responsible for the state of splendid
isolation in which our discipline nowadays
finds itself.

An exceptional example of a healthy
balance between theoretical and empirical
analysis and of the readiness of professional
economists to cooperate with experts in
the neighboring disciplines is offered by
Agricultural Economics as it developed in
this country over the last fifty years. A
unique combination of social and political
forces has secured for this area unusually
strong organizational and generous financial
support. Official agricultural statistics
are more complete, reliable, and systematic
than those pertaining to any other major
sector of our economy. Close collaboration
with agronomists provides agricultural
economists with direct access to information
of a technological kind. When they
speak of crop rotation, fertilizers, or alternative
harvesting techniques, they usually
know, sometimes from personal experience,
what they are talking about. Preoccupation
with the standard of living of the rural
population has led agricultural economists
into collaboration with home economists
and sociologists, that is, with social scientists
of the "softer" kind. While centering
their interest on only one part of the economic
system, agricultural economists
demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic
combination of theoretical approach
with detailed factual analysis. They
also were the first among economists to
make use of the advanced methods of
mathematical statistics. However, in their
hands, statistical infereince became a
complement to, not a substitute for,
empirical research.

The shift from casual empiricism that
dominates much of today's econometric
work to systematic large-scale factual
analysis will not be easy. To start with, it
will require a sharp increase in the annual
appropriation for Federal Statistical Agencies.
The quality of government statistics
has, of course, been steadily improving.
The coverage, however, does not keep up
with the growing complexity of our social
and economic system and our capability
of handling larger and larger data flows.
The spectacular advances in computer
technology increased the economists' potential
ability to make effective analytical
use of large sets of detailed data. The time


### ---Economics-1971-0-08.txt---
is past when the best that could be done
with large sets of variables was to reduce
their number by averaging them out or
what is essentially the same, combining
them into broad aggregates; now we can
manipulate complicated analytical systems
without suppressing the identity of
their individual elements. There is a
certain irony in the fact that, next to the
fast-growing service industries, the areas
whose coverage by the Census is particularly
deficient are the operations of
government agencies, both federal and
local.

To place all or even the major responsibility
for the collection of economic data
in the hands of one central organization
would be a mistake. The prevailing decentralized
approach that permits and

encourages a great number of government
agencies, non-profit institutions and private
businesses engaged in data gathering
activities acquitted itself very well. Better
information means more detailed information
and detailed specialized information
can be best collected by those immediately
concerned with a particular field. What is,
however, urgently needed is the establishment,
maintenance and enforcement of
coordinated uniform classification systems
by all agencies, private as well as public,
involved in this work. Incompatible data
are useless data. How far from a tolerable,
not to say, ideal state our present economic
statistics are in this respect, can be judged
by the fact that because of differences in
classification, domestic output data cannot
be compared, for many goods, with the
corresponding export and import figures.
Neither can the official employment statistics
be related without laborious adjustments
to output data, industry by industry.
An unreasonably high proportion
of material and intellectual resources devoted
to statistical work is now spent not
on the collection of primary information
but on a frustrating and wasteful struggle
with incongruous definitions and irreconcilable
classifications.

Without invoking a misplaced methodological
analogy, the task of securing a
massive flow of primary economic data can
be compared to that of providing the high
energy physicists with a gigantic accelerator.
The scientists have their machines
while the economists are still waiting for
their data. In our case not only must the
society be willing to provide year after
year the millions of dollars required for
maintenance of a vast statistical machine,
but a large number of citizens must be prepared
to play, at least, a passive and occasionally
even an active part in actual

fact-finding operations. It is as if the electrons
and protons had to be persuaded to
cooperate with the physicist.

The average American does not seem to
object to being interviewed, polled, and
surveyed. Curiosity, the desire to find out
how the economic system (in which most of
us are small gears, and some, big wheels)
works might in many instances provide
sufficient inducement for cooperation of
this kind.

One runs up, of course, occasionally
against the attitude that "what you don't
know can't hurt you" and that knowledge
might be dangerous: it may generate a
desire to tinker with the system. The
experience of these years seems, however,
to have convinced not only most economists-
with a few notable exceptions-but
also the public at large that a lack of
economic knowledge can hurt badly. Our
free enterprise system has rightly been
compared to a gigantic computing machine
capable of solving its own problems automatically.
But any one who has had some

practical experience with large computers
knows that they do break down and can't
operate unattended. To keep the automatic,
or rather the semi-automatic, engine
of our economy in good working order we
must not only understand the general


### ---Economics-1971-0-09.txt---
principles on which it operates, but also
be acquainted with the details of its actual
design.

A new element has entered the picture
in recent years-the adoption of methods
of modern econiomic analysis by private
business. Corporate support of economic
research goes as far back as the early
1920's when Wesley Mitchell founded the
National Bureau. However, it is not this
concern for broad issues of public policies
or even the general interest in economic
growth and business fluctuations that I
have in mind, but rather the fast-spreading
use of advanced methods of Operations
Research and of so-called Systems' Analysis.
Some of the standard concepts and
analytical devices of economic theory first
found their way into the curricula of our
business schools and soon after that, sophisticated
management began to put

them into practice. While academic theorists
are content with the formulation of
general principles, corporate operations
researchers and practical systems' analysts
have to answer questions pertaining to
specific real situations. Demand for economic
data to be used in practical business
planning is growing at an accelerated pace.
It is a high quality demand: business users
in most instances possess first-hand technical
knowledge of the area to which the data
they ask for refer. Moreover, this demand
is usually "effective." Profit-making business
is willing and able to pay the costs of
gathering the inlformation it wants to have.
This raises the thorny question of public
access to privately collected data and of
the proper division of labor and cooperation
between government and business in
that fast-expanding field. Under the inexorable
pressure of rising practical demand,
these problems will be solved in one
way or another. Our economy will be surveyed
and mapped in all its many dimensions
on a larger and larger scale.

Economists should be prepared to take
a leading role in shaping this major social
enterprise not as someone else's spokesmen
and advisers, but on their own behalf.
They have failed to do this up to now. The
Conference of Federal Statistics Users
organized several years ago had business,
labor, and many other groups represented
among its members, but not economists as
such. How can we expect our needs to be
satisfied if our voices are not heard?
We, I mean the academic economists,
are ready to expound, to any one ready to
lend an ear, our views on problems of public
policy: give advice on the best ways to
maintain full employment, to fight inflation,
to foster economic growth. We should
be equally prepared to share with the
wider public the hopes and disappointments
which accompany the advance of
our own often desperately difficult, but
always exciting intellectual enterprise.
This public has amply demonstrated its
readiness to back the pursuit of knowledge.
It will lend its generous support to our
venture too, if we take the trouble to
explain what it is all about.

### ---Economics-1972-0-03.txt---
The world economy today is vastly
different from the 1930's, when Seymour
Harris, the chairman of this meeting, infected
me with his boundless enthusiasm
for economics and his steadfast confidence
in its capacity for good works. Economics
is very different, too. Both the science and
its subject have changed, and for the
better, since World War II. But there are
some notable constants. Unemployment
and inflation still preoccupy and perplex
economists, statesmen, journalists, housewives,
and everyone else. The connection
between them is the principal domestic
economic burden of presidents and prime
ministers, and the major area of controversy
and ignorance in macroeconomics.
I have chosen to review economic thought
on this topic on this occasion, partly because
of its inevitable timeliness, partly
because of a personal interest reaching
back to my first published work in 1941.
I. The Meanings of Full Employment
Today, as thirty and forty years ago,
economists debate how much unemployment
is voluntary, how much involuntary;
how much is a phenomenon of equilibrium,
how much a symptom of disequilibrium;
how much is compatible with competition,
how much is to be blamed on monopolies,
labor unions, and restrictive legislation;
how much unemployment characterizes
"full" employment.

Full employment imagine macroeconomics
deprived of the concept. But

what is it? What is the proper employment
goal of policies affecting aggregate demand?
Zero unemployment in the monthly
labor force survey? That outcome is so
inconceivable outside of Switzerland that
it is useless as a guide to policy. Any other
numerical candidate, yes even 4 percent,
is patently arbitrary without reference to
basic criteria. Unemployment equal to
vacancies? Measurement problems aside,
this definition has the same straightforward
appeal as zero unemployment, which
it simply corrects for friction.1
A concept of full employment more
congenial to economic theory is labor
market equilibrium, a volume of employment
which is simultaneously the amount
employers want to offer and the amount
workers want to accept at prevailing wage
rates and prices. Forty years ago theorists
with confidence in markets could believe
that full employment is whatever volume
of employment the economy is moving
toward, and that its achievement requires
of the government nothing more than
neutrality, and nothing less

After Keynes challenged the classical
notion of labor market equilibrium and
the complacent view of policy to which it
led, full employment came to mean max;-
mum aggregate supply, the point at which
expansion of aggregate demand could not
further increase employment and output.
Full employment was also regarded as
the economy's inflation threshold. With a
deflationary gap, demand less than full
employment supply, prices would be declining
or at worst constant. Expansion of
aggregate demand short of full employment
would cause at most a one-shot


### ---Economics-1972-0-04.txt---
increase of prices. For continiuing inflation,
the textbooks tol(I us, a necessary and
sufficient conditioin was an inflationary
gap, real aggregate (lemand in excess of
feasible supply. T he modlel was tailormade
for wartime inflation.

Postwar experience destroyed the identification
of full employmeint with the

economy's inflation threshold. The profession,
the press, andI the public discovered
the "new inflation" of the 1950's, inflation
without beniefit of gap), labelled but
scarcely illuminated by the term "costpush.
" Subsequently the view of the world
suggested by the Phillips curve merged
demand-pull and cost-push inflation and
blurred the distinction between them.
This view containe(d no concept of full employment.
In its place came the tradeoff,
along which society supposedly can choose
the least undesirable feasible combination
of the evils of unemployment and inflation.
Many economists deny the existence of
a durable Phillips tradeoff. TIheir numbers
and influence are increasing. Some of them
contendl that there is only one rate of
unemployment compatible with steady
inflation, a "natural rate" consistent with
any steadly rate of change of prices, positive,
zero, or negative. The natural rate is
another full employment candidate, a
policy target at least in the passive sense
that monetary and fiscal policy makers
are advised to eschew any numerical unemployment
goal and to let the economy

gravitate to this equilibrium. So we have
come full circle. Full employment is once
again nothing but the equilibrium reached
by labor markets unaidedl andl undlistorted
by governmental fine tuning.

In discussing these issues, I shall make
the following points. First, an observed
amount of unemployment is not revealed
to be voluntary simply by the fact that
money wage rates are constant, or rising,
or even accelerating. I shall recall and extend
Keynes's dlefinition of involuntary
unemployment and his explanation why
workers may accept price inflation as a
method of re(lucing real wages while rejecting
money wage cuts. The second

point is related. Involuntary unemployment
is a disequilibrium phenomenon;
the behavior, the persistence, of excess
supplies of labor depend on how and how
fast markets adjust to shocks, and on how
large and how frequent the shocks are.
Higher prices or faster inflation can
(liminish involuntary, disequilibrium unemployment,
even though voluntary, eqluilibrium
labor supply is entirely free of
money illusion.

Third, various criteria of full employment
coincide in a theoretical full stationary
eqjuilibrium, but diverge in persistent
disequilibrium. These are 1) the
natural rate of unemployment, the rate
compatible with zero or some other constant
inflation rate, 2) zero involuntary
unemployment, 3) the rate of unemployment
needed for optimal job search and
placement, and 4) unemployment equal
to job vacancies. The first criterion dictates
higher unemployment than any of
the rest. Instead of commending the natural
rate as a target of employment policy,
the other three criteria suggest less unemployment
and more inflation. Therefore,
fourth, there are real gains from additional
employment, which must be

weighed in the social balance against the
costs of inflation. I shall conclude with a
few remarks on this choice, and on the
possibilities of improving the terms of the
tradeoff.

II. Keynesian and Classical Interpretations
of Unemployment

To begin with the General Theory is not
just the ritual piety economists of my
generation owe the book that shaped their
minds. Keynes's treatment of labor market
equilibrium and disequilibrium in his
first chapter is remarkably relevant today.


### ---Economics-1972-0-05.txt---
Keynes attacked what he called the
classical presumption that persistent unemployment
is voluntary unemployment.

The presumption he challenged is that in
competitive labor markets actual employment
and unemployment reveal workers'
true preferences between work and
alternative uses of time, the presumption
that no one is fully or partially unemployed
whose real wage per hour exceeds
his marginal valuation of an hour of free
time. Orthodox economists found the observed
stickiness of money wages to be
persuasive evidence that unemployment,
even in the Great Depression, was voluntary.
Keynes found decisive evidence
against this inference in the willingness of
workers to accept a larger volume of employment
at a lower real wage resulting
from an increase of prices.

Whenever unemployment could be reduced
by expansion of aggregate demand,
Keynes regarded it as involuntary. He expected
expansion to raise prices and lower
real wages, but this expectation is not
crucial to his argument. Indeed, if it is possible
to raise employment without reduction
in the real wage, his case for calling the unemployment
involuntary is strengthened.

But why is the money wage so stubborn
if more labor is willingly available at the
same or lower real wage5? Consider first
some answers Keynes did not give. He did
not appeal to trade union monopolies or
minimum wage laws. He was anxious, perhaps
over-anxious, to meet his putative
classical opponents on their home field,
the competitive economy\ He did not rely
on any failure of workers to perceive what
a rise in prices does to real wages. The unemployed
take new jobs, the employed

hold old ones, with eyes open. Otherwise
the new situation would be transient.
Instead, Keynes emphasized the institutional
fact that wages are bargained

and set in the monetary unit of account.
Money wage rates are, to use an unKeynesian
term, "administered prices." I'hat is,
they are not set and reset in daily auctions
but posted and fixed for finite periods of
time. This observation led Keynes to his
central explanation: Workers, individually
and in groups, are more concerned with
relative than absolute real wages. They
may withdraw labor if their wages fall
relatively to wages elsewhere, even though
they would not withdraw any if real wages
fall uniformly everywhere. Labor markets
are decentralized, and there is no way
money wages can fall in any one market
without impairing the relative status of
the workers there. A general rise in prices
is a neutral and universal method of reducing
real wages, the only method in a
decentralized and uncontrolled economy.
Inflation would not be needed, we may
infer, if by government compulsion, economy-
wide bargaining, or social compact,
all money wage rates could be scaled down
together.

Keynes apparently meant that relative
wages are the arguments in labor supply
functions. But Alchian (pp. 27-52 in Phelps
et al.) and other theorists of search activity
have offered a somewhat different
interpretation, namely that workers whose
money wages are reduced will quit their
jobs to seek employment in other markets
where they think, perhaps mistakenly,
that wages remain high.

Keynes's explanation of money wage
stickiness is plausible and realistic. But two
related analytical issues have obscured the
message. Can there be involuntary unemployment
in an equilibrium, a proper, fullfledged
neoclassical equilibrium? Does the
labor supply behavior described by Keynes
betray "money illusion"? Keynes gave a
loud yes in answer to the first question,
and this seems at first glance to compel an
affirmative answer to the second.
An economic theorist can, of course,
commit no greater crime than to assume
money illusion. Comparative statics is a


### ---Economics-1972-0-06.txt---
nonhistorical exercise, in which different
price levels are to be viewed as alternative
rather th bn sequential. Compare two
situations that differ only in the scale of
exogenous monetary variables; imagine,
for example, that all such magnitudes are
ten times as high in one situation as in the
other. All equilibrium prices, including
money wage rates, should differ in the
same proportion, while all real magnitudes,
including employment, should be the same
in the two equilibria. To assume instead
that workers' supply decisions vary with
the price level is to say that they would
behave differently if the unit of account
were, and always had been, dimes instead
of dollars. Surely Keynes should not be
interpreted to attribute to anyone money
illusion in this sense. He was not talking
about so strict and static an equilibrium.
Axel Leijonhufvud's illuminating and
perceptive interpretation of Keynes argues
convincingly that, in chapter 1 as throughout
the General Theory, what Keynes calls
equilibrium should be viewed as persistent
disequilibrium, and what appears to be
comparative statics is really shrewd and
incisive, if awkward, dynamic analysis.
Involuntary unemployment means that
labor markets are not in equilibrium. The
resistance of money wage rates to excess
supply is a feature of the adjustment process
rather than a symptom of irrationality.


The other side of Keynes's story is that
in depressions money wage deflation, even
if it occurred more speedily, or especially
if it occurred more speedily, would be at
best a weak equilibrator and quite possibly
a source of more unemployment rather
than less. In contemporary language, the
perverse case would arise if a high and
ever-increasing real rate of return on
money inhibited real demand faster than
the rising purchasing power of monetary
stocks stimulated demand. To pursue this
Keynesian theme further here would be a
digression.

What relevance has this excursion into
depression economics for contemporary
problems of unemployment and wage inflation?
The issues are remarkably similar,
even though events and Phillips have
shifted attention from levels to time rates
of change of wages and prices. Phillips
curve doctrine2 is in an important sense
the postwar analogue of Keynesian wage
and employment theory, while natural
rate doctrine is the contemporary version
of the classical position Keynes was opposing.


Phillips curve doctrine implies that
lower unemployment can be purchased at
the cost of faster inflation. Let us adapt
Keynes's test for involuntary unemployment
to the dynamic terms of contemporary
discussion of inflation, wages, and
unemployment. Suppose that the current
rate of unemployment continues. Associated
with it is a path of real wages,
rising at the rate of productivity growth.
Consider an alternative future, with unemployment
at first declining to a rate one
percentage point lower and then remaining
constant at the lower rate. Associated
with the lower unemployment alternative
will be a second path of real wages. Eventually
this real wage path will show, at
least to first approximation, the same rate
of increase as the first one, the rate of
productivity growth. But the paths may
differ because of the transitional effects of
increasing the rate of employment. The
growth of real wages will be retarded in
the short run if additional employment
lowers labor's marginal productivity. In
any case, the test question is whether with
full information about the two alternatives
labor would accept the second one-
2 Phillips himself is not a prophet of the doctrine associated
with his curve. His 1958 article was probably the
most influential macro-economic paper of the last
quarter century. But Phillips simply presented some
striking empirical findings, which others have replicated
many times for many economies. He is not responsible
for the theories and policy conclusions his findings
stimulated.


### ---Economics-1972-0-07.txt---
whether, in other words, the additional
employment would be willingly supplied
aloing the second real wage path. If the
answer is affirmative, then that one percentage
point of unemployment is involuntary.


For Keynes's reasons, a negative answer
cannot necessarily be inferred from
failure of money wage rates to fall or even
decelerate. Actual unemployment and the
real wage path associated with it are not
necessarily an equilibrium. Rigidities in
the path of money wage rates can be explained
by workers' preoccupation with
relative wages and the absence of any
cetntral economy-wide mechanism for altering
all money wages together.

According to the natural rate hypothesis,
there is just one rate of unemployment
compatible with stea(ly wage and price
inflation, andl this is in the long run compatible
with any constant rate of change of
prices, positive, zero, or negative. Only
at the natural rate of unemployment are
workers content with current and prospective
real wages, content to have their real
wages rise at the rate of growth of productivity.
Along the feasible path of real
wages they would not wish to accept any
larger volume of employment. Lower unemployment,
therefore, can arise only from
economy-wide excess demand for labor
and must generate a gap between real
wages (lesired and real wages earned. The
gap evokes increases of money wages designed
to raise real wages faster than productivity.
But this intention is always

frustrated, the gap is never closed, money
wages and prices accelerate. By symmetrical
argument, unemployment above

the natural rate signifies excess supply in
labor markets and ever accelerating deflation.
Older classical economists regarded
constancy of money wage rates as indicative
of full employment equilibrium, at
which the allocation of time between work
and other pursuits is revealed as voluntary
and optimal. Their successors make the
same claims for the natural rate of unemployment,
except that in the equilibrium
money wages are not necessarily
constant but growing at the rate of productivity
gain plus the experienced and

expected rate of inflation of prices.
III. Is Zero-Inflation Unemployment
Voluntary and Optimal?

There are, then, two conflicting interpretations
of the welfare value of employment
in excess of the level consistent with
price stability. One is that additional
employment does not produce enough to
compensate workers for the value of other
uses of their time. The fact that it generates
inflation is taken as prima facie
evidence of a welfare loss. The alternative
view, which I shall argue, is that the responses
of money wages and prices to

changes in aggregate demand reflect
mechanics of adjustment, institutional
constraints, and relative wage patterns
and reveal nothing in particular about
individual or social valuations of unemployed
time vis-a-vis the wages of employment.


On this rostrum four years ago, Milton
Friedman identified the noninflationary
natural rate of unemployment with "equilibrium
in the structure of real wage

rates" (p. 8). "The 'natural rate of unemployment,
' " he said, ". . . is the level
that would be ground out by the Walrasian
system of general equilibrium equations,
provided that there is embedded in them
the actual structural characteristics of the
labor and commodity markets, including
market imperfections, stochastic variability
in demands and supplies, the costs of
getting information about job vacancies
and labor availabilities, the costs of mobility,
and so on." Presumably this

Walrasian equilibrium also has the usual
optimal properties; at any rate, Friedman
advised the monetary authorities not to
seek to improve upon it. But in fact we
know little about the existence of a


### ---Economics-1972-0-08.txt---
Walrasian equilibrium that allows for all
the imperfections and frictions that explain
why the natural rate is bigger than
zero, ancl eveni less about the optimality
of such an equilibriunm if it exists.
In the new microeconomics of labor
markets and inflatioin, the principal activity
whose marginal value sets the reservation
price of employment is job search.
It is not pure leisure, for in principle persons
who choose that option are not reported
as unemployed; however, there may
be a leisure component in job seeking.
A crucial assumption of the theory is
that search is significantly more efficient
when the searcher is unemployed, but
almost no evidence has been advanced on
this point. Members of our own profession
are adept at seeking and finding new jobs
without first leaving their old ones or
abandoning not-in-labor-force status. We
do not know how many quits and new hires
in manufacturing are similar transfers, but
some of them must be; if all reported
accessions were hires of unemployed workers,
the mean duration of unemployment
would be only about half what it is in fact.
In surveys of job mobility among blue
collar workers in 1946-47 (see Lloyd
Reynolds, pp. 2 14-15, and Herbert Parnes,
pp. 158-59), 25 percent of workers who
quit had new jobs lined up in advance.
Reynolds found that the main obstacle
to mobility without unemployment was
not lack of information or time, but simply
"anti-pirating" collusion by employers.
A considerable amount of search activity
by unemployed workers appears to be
an unpro(luctive consequence of dissatisfaction
and frustration rather than a

rational quest for improvement. This was
the conclusion of Reynolds' survey twentyfive
years ago, p. 215, and it has been reemphasized
for the contemporary scene by

Robert Hall, and by Peter Doeringer and
Michael Piore for what they term the
secondary labor force. Reynolds found
that quitting a job to look for a new one
while unemployed actually yielded a better
job in only a third of the cases. Lining up a
new job in advance was a more successful
strategy: two-thirds of such changes
turned out to be improvements. Today,
according to the dual labor market hypothesis,
the basic reason for frequent and
long spells of unemployment in the secondary
labor force is the shortage of good jobs.
In any event, the contention of some
natural rate theorists is that employment
beyond the natural rate takes time that
would be better spent in search activity.
Why do workers accept such employment?
An answer to this question is a key element
in a theory that generally presumes
that actual behavior reveals true preferences.
The answer giveIn is that workers
accept the additional employment only
because they are victims of inflation illusion.
One form of inflation illusion is overestimation
of the real wages of jobs they
now hold, if they are employed, or of jobs
they find, if they are unemployed and
searching. If they did not under-estimate
price inflation, employed workers would
more often quit to search, and unemployed
workers would search longer.

The force of this argument seems to me
diluted by the fact that price inflation
illusion affects equally both sides of the
job seeker's equation. He over-estimates
the real value of an immediate job, but he
also over-estimates the real values of jobs
he might wait for. It is in the spirit of this
theorizing to assume that money interest
rates respond to the same correct or incorrect
inflationary expectations. As a
first approximation, inflation illusion has
no substitution effect on the margin between
working and waiting.

It does have an income effect, causing
workers to exaggerate their real wealth.
In which direction the income effect
would work is not transparent. 1)oes
greater wealth, or the illusion of greater


### ---Economics-1972-0-09.txt---
wealth, make people more choosy about
jobs, more inclined to quit and to wait?
Or less choosy, more inclined to stay in
the job they have or to take the first one
that comes along? I should have thought
more selective rather than less. But natural
rate theory must take the opposite
view if it is to explain why under-estimation
of price inflation bamboozles workers
into holding or taking jobs that they do
not reallv want.

Another form of alleged inflation illusion
refers to wages rather than prices.
Workers are myopic anl (1o not perceive
that wages elsewhere are, or soon will be,
rising as fast as the money wage of the
job they now hold or have just found.
Consequently they under-estimate the
advantages of quitting and searching.
This explanationi is convincing only to the
extent that the payoff to search activity
is determined by wage differentials. The
payoff also depends on the probabilities of
getting jobs at quoted wages, therefore on
the balance between vacancies and job
seekers. Workers know that perfectly well.
Quit rates are an index of volunitary
search activity. They do not diminish
when unemployment is low and wage
rates are rapidly rising. They increase,
quite understandably. This fact contradicts
the inflation illusion story, both
versions. 1 conclude that it is not possible
to regard fluctuations of unemployment
on either side of the zero-inflation rate as
mainly voluntary, albeit mistaken, extensions
and contractions of search activity.
The new microeconomics of job search
(see Edmund Phelps et al.), is nevertheless
a valuable contribution to understanding
of frictional unemployment. It
provides reasons why some unemployment
is voluntary, and why some unemployment
is socially efficient.

Does the market produce the optimal
amount of search unemployment? Is the
natural rate optimal? I do not believe the
new microeconomics has yet answered
these questions.

An omniscient and beneficent economic
dictator would not place every new job
seeker immediately in any job at hand.
Such a policy would create many mismatches,
sacrificing efficiency in production
or necessitating costly job-to-job shifts later
on. The hypothetical planner would prefer
to keep a queue of workers unemployed,
so that he would have a larger choice of
jobs to which to assign them. But he would
not make the queue too long, because
workers in the queue are not producing
anything.

Of course he could shorten the queue of
unemployed if he could dispose of more
jobs and lengthen the queue of vacancies.
With enough jobs of various kinds, he
would never lack a vacancy for which any
worker who happens to come along has
comparative advantage. But because of
limited capital stocks and interdependence
among skills, jobs cannot be indefinitely
multiplied without lowering their marginal
productivity. Our wise and benevolent
planner would not place people in jobs
yielding less than the marginal value of
leisure. Given this constraint on the
number of jobs, he would always have to
keep some workers waiting, and some jobs
vacant. But he certainly would be inefficient
if he had fewer jobs, filled and
vacant, than this constraint. This is the
common sense of Beveridge's rule-that
vacancies should not be less than unemployment.


Is the natural rate a market solution of
the hypothetical planner's operations research
problem?/ According to search

theory, an unemployed worker considers
the probabilities that he can get a better
job by searching longer and balances the
expected discounted value of waiting
against the loss of earnings. The employed
worker makes a similar calculation when
he considers quitting, also taking into account


### ---Economics-1972-0-10.txt---
the once and for all costs of movement.
These calculations are like those of
the planner, but witlh an important difference.
An individual does not initernalize
all the considerations the planner takes
into account. The external effects are the
familiar ones of congestion theory. A
worker decidling to join a queue or to stay
in one consi(lers the probabilities of getting
a job, but not the effects of his decision on
the probabilities that others face. He
lowers those probabilities for people in
the queue he joins and raises them for persons
waiting for the kind of job he vacates
or turns (lown. tI0oo many persons are
unemployed waiting for good jobs, while
less desirable ones go begging. However,
externial effects also occur in the
(lecisions of employers whether to fill a
vacancy with the applicant at hand or to
wait for someone more qualified. It is not
obvious, at least to me, whether the market
is biased toward excessive or inadlequate
search. But it is doubtful that it
produces the optimal amounit.

Empirically the proposition that in the
United States the zero-inflation rate of
unemployment reflects voluntary and efficienit
job-seeking activity strains credulity.
If there were a natural rate of unemployment
in the United States, what would it
be? It is hard to say because virtually all
econometric Phillips curves allow for a
whole menu of steady inflation rates. But
estimates constrained to produce a vertical
long-run Phillips curve suggest a natural
rate between 5 and 6 percent of the labor
force.3

So let us consider some of the features of
an overall unemployment rate of 5 to 6 percent.
First, about 40 percent of accessions
in manufacturing are rehires rather than
new hires. Temporarily laid off by their
employers, these workers had been awaiting
recall and were scarcely engaged in
voluntary search activity. Their unemployment
is as much a deadweight loss as
the disguised unemployment of redundant
workers oni payrolls. This number declines
to 25-30 percent when unemployment is
4 percent or below. Likewise, a 5-6 perceint
unemployment rate means that voluntary
quits amount only to about a third of
separations, layoffs to two-thir(-ds. The proportions
are rever-sed at low unemployment
rates.

Second, the unemployment statistic is
not an exhaustive count of those with time
and inceintive to search. An additional
3 percent of the labor force are involuntarily
confinedI to part-time work, atid another
3 4 of t percent are out of the labor
force because they "could not find job" or
"think no work available"---discouraged
by market con(litions rather than personal
incapacities.

Third, with unemployment of 5-6 percent
the number of reported vacancies is
less than 1/ 2 of 1 percent. Vacancies appear
to be understated relative to unemployment,
but they rise to l2 percent when
the unemployment rate is below 4 percent.
At 5-6 percent unemployment, the
economy is clearly capable of generating
many more jobs with marginal productivity
high enough so that people prefer
them to leisure. TI he capital stock is Ino
limitation, siince 5-6 percent unemployment
has beeni associated with more than
20 percent excess capacity. Mioreover,
when more jobs are createdI by expansion
of demand, with or without inflation, labor
force participation increases; this would
hardly occur if the aclditional jobs were low
in quality and productivity. As the parable
of the central employment plannier indicates,
there will be excessive waiting for
jobs if the roster of jobs an(d the meniu of
vacancies are suboptimal.

In summary, labor markets characterized
by 5-6 percent unemployment do
not display the symptoms one would exI
See Lucas and Rapping, pp. 257-305, in Phelps et al.


### ---Economics-1972-0-11.txt---
pect if the unemployment were voluntary
search activity. Even if it were voluntary,
search activity on such a large scale would
surely be socially wasteful. The only
reason anyone might regard so high an
unemployment rate as an equilibrium
and social optimum is that lower rates
cause accelerating inflation. B3 ut this is
almost tautological. TIhe inferences of equilibrium
anid optimality would be more

conivincing if they were corroboratecI by
direct evidence.

IV. Why is There Inflation without
Aggregate Excess Demand?

Zero-inflation unemployment is not
wholly voluntary, not optimal, I might
eveni say not natural. In other words, the
economy has an inflationary bias: WNhen
labor markets provide as many jobs as
there are willing workers, there is inflation,
perhaps accelerating inflation. Why?
The Phillips curve has been an empirical
finding in search of a theory, like Pirandello
characters in search of an author.
One rationalization might be termecl a
theory of stochastic macro-equilibrium:
stochastic, because random intersectoral
shocks keep individual labor markets in
diverse states of disequilibrium; macroequilibrium,
because the perpetual flux

of particular markets produces fairly
defnite aggregate outcomes of unemployment
and wages. Stimulated by Phillips's
1958 findings, Richard Lipsey proposed a
model of this kind in 1960, and it has
since been elaborated by Archibald, pp.
212-23 and Holt, pp. 53-123 and 224-56
in Phelps et. al., and others. I propose
now to sketch a theory in the same
spirit.

It is an essential feature of the theory
that economy-wide relations among employment,
wages, and prices are aggregations
of diverse outcomes in heterogeneous
markets. The myth of macroeconomics is
that relations among aggregates are enlarged
analogues of relations among corresponding
variables for individual households,
firms, industries, markets. The myth
is a harmless and useful simplification in
many contexts, but sometimes it misses
the essence of the phenomenon.
Unemployment is, in this model as in
Keynes reinterpreted, a disequilibrium phenomenon.
Money wages do not adjust

rapidly enough to clear all labor markets
every clay. Excess supplies in labor markets
take the form of unemployment, and
excess demands the form of unfilled
vacancies. At any moment, markets vary
widlely in excess demand or supply, and
the economy as a whole shows both
vacancies and unemployment.

The overall balance of vacancies and
unemployment is determined by aggregate
demand, and is therefore in principle subject
to control by overall monetary and
fiscal policy. Higher aggregate demand
means fewer excess supply markets and
more excess demand markets, accordingly
less unemployment and more vacancies.
In any particular labor market, the rate
of increase of money wages is the sum of
two components, an equilibrium component
and a disequilibrium component. The
first is the rate at which the wage would
increase were the market in equilibrium,
with neither vacancies nor unemployment.
The other component is a function of excess
demand and supply-a monotonic

function, positive for positive excess demand,
zero for zero excess demand, nonpositive
for excess supply. I begin with
the disequilibrium component.

Of course the disequilibrium components
are relevant only if disequilibria
persist. Why aren't they eliminated bv the
very adjustments they set in motion ?
Workers will move from excess supply
markets to excess demand markets, and
from low wage to high wage markets.
Unless they overshoot, these movements
are equilibrating. The theory therefore


### ---Economics-1972-0-12.txt---
requires that new disequilibria are always
arising. Aggregate demand may be stable,
but beneath its stability is never-ending
flux: new products, new processes, new
tastes and fashions, new developments of
land and niatural resources, obsolescent
industries and (leclining areas.
The overlap of vacancies and unemployment-
-say, the sum of the two for

any given difference between them--is a
measure of the heterogeneity or dispersion
of individual markets. The amount of
(lispersion (lepen(1s directly on the size of
those shocks of demand anid technology
that keep markets in perpetual disequilibriumn,
and inversely on the responsive mobility
of labor. The one increases, the other
diminishes the frictional component of
unemployment, that is, the number of unfilled
vacancies coexisting with any given
unemployment rate.

A central assumptioin of the theory is
that the functions relating wage change
to excess demand or supply are non-linear,
specifically that unemployment retards
money wages less than vacancies accelerate
them. Noinlinearity in the response of
wages to excess demand has several important
implications. First, it helps to
explain the characteristic observed curvature
of the Phillips curve. Each successive
increment of unemployment has less effect
in reducing the rate of inflation. Linear
wage response, on the other hand, would
mean a linear Phillips relation.
Second, given the overall state of aggregate
demand, economy-wide vacancies less
unemployment, wage inflation will be
greater the larger the variance among
markets in excess (lemand and supply.
As a number of recent empirical studies,
have confirmed (see George Perry and
Charles Schultze), dispersion is inflationary.
Of course, the rate of wage

inflation will depend not only on the
overall (lispersion of excess demands and
supplies across markets but also on the
particular markets where the excess supplies
and demands happen to fall. An unlucky
random (Irawing might put the

excess demands in highly responsive markets
and the excess supplies in especially
unresponsive ones.

Third, the nonlinearity is an explanation
of inflationary bias, in the following
sense. Even when aggregate vacancies are
at most equal to unemployment, the average
disequilibrium component will be
positive. Full employment in the sense of
equality of vacancies and unemployment
is not compatible with price stability.
Zero inflation requires unemployment in
excess of vacancies.

Criteria that coincide in full long-run
equilibrium zero inflation and zero aggregate
excess demand diverge in stochastic
macro-equilibrium. Full long-run
equilibrium in all markets would show no
unemployment, no vacancies, no unanticipated
inflation. But with unending sectoral
flux, zero excess (lemand spells inflation
and zero inflation spells net excess
supply, unemployment in excess of vacancies.
In these circumstances neither
criterion can be justified simply because it
is a property of full long-run equilibrium.
Both criteria automatically allow for frictional
unemployment incident to the required
movements of workers between

markets; the no-inflation criterion requires
enough additional unemployment to wipe
out inflationary bias.

' I turn now to the equilibrium component,
the rate of wage increase in a market
with neither excess demand nor excess
supply. It is reasonable to suppose that the
equilibrium component depends on the
trend of wages of comparable labor elsewhere.
A "competitive wage," one that
reflects relevant trends fully, is what employers
will offer if they wish to maintain
their share of the volume of employment.
TI his will happen where the rate of growth
of marginal revenue product the compound


### ---Economics-1972-0-13.txt---
of productivity increase and price
inflation-is the same as the trend in
wages. But in some markets the equilibrium
wage will be rising faster, and in
others slower, than the economy-wide
wage trend.

A "natural rate" result follows if actual
wage increases feed fully into the equilibrium
components of future wage increases.
There will be acceleration whenever the
non-linear disequilibrium effects are on
average positive, and steady inflation, that
is stochastically steady inflation, only at
unemployment rates high enough to make
the disequilibrium effects wash out. Phillips
tradeoffs exist in the short run, and
the time it takes for them to evaporate
depends on the lengths of the lags with
which today's actual wage gains become
tomorrow's standards.

A rather minor modification may preserve
Phillips tradeoffs in the long run.
Suppose there is a floor on wage change in
excess supply markets, independent of the
amount of excess supply and of the past
history of wages and prices. Suppose, for
example, that wage change is never negative;
it is either zero or what the response
function says, whichever is algebraically
larger. So long as there are markets where
this floor is effective, there can be determinate
rates of economy-wide wage inflation
for various levels of aggregate demand.
Markets at the floor do not increase their
contributions to aggregate wage inflation
when overall demand is raised. Nor is their
contribution escalated to actual wage
experience. But the frequency of such
markets diminishes, it is true, both with
overall demand and with inflation. The
floor phenomenon can preserve a Phillips
tradeoff within limits, but one that becomes
ever more fragile and vanishes as
greater demand pressure removes markets
from contact with the zero floor. The
model implies a long-run Phillips curve
that is very flat for high unemployment
and becomes vertical at a critically low
rate of unemployment.

These implications seem plausible and
even realistic. It will be objected, however,
that any permanent floor independent of
general wage and price history and expectation
must indicate money illusion.

The answer is that the floor need not be
permanent in any single market. It could
give way to wage reduction when enough
unemployment has persisted long enough.
But with stochastic intersectoral shifts of
demand, markets are always exchanging
roles, and there can always be some markets,
not always the same ones, at the floor.
This model avoids the empirically questionable
implication of the usual natural
rate hypothesis that unemployment rates
only slightly higher than the critical rate
will trigger ever-accelerating deflation.
Phillips curves seem to be pretty flat at
high rates of unemployment. During the
great contraction of 1930-33, wage rates
were slow to give way even in the face of
massive unemployment and substantial
deflation in consumer prices. Finally in
1932 and 1933 money wage rates fell more
sharply, in response to prolonged unemployment,
layoffs, shutdowns, and to

threats and fears of more of the same.
I have gone through this example to
make the point that irrationality, in the
sense that meaningless differences in
money values permanently affect individual
behavior, is not logically necessary for
the existence of a long-run Phillips tradeoff.
In full long-run equilibrium in all
markets, employment and unemployment
would be independent of the levels and
rates of change of money wage rates and
prices. But this is not an equilibrium that
the system ever approaches. The economy
is in perpetual sectoral disequilibrium
even when it has settled into a stochastic
macro-equilibrium.

I suppose that one might maintain that
asymmetry in wage adjustment and temporary


### ---Economics-1972-0-14.txt---
resistance to money wage decline
reflect money illusion in some sense. Such
an assertion would have to be based on an
extension of the domain of well-defined
rational behavior to cover responses to
change, adjustment speeds, costs of information,
costs of organizing and operating
markets, and a host of other problems
in dynamic theory. These theoretical extensions
are in their infancy, although
much work of interest and promise is being
done. Meanwhile, I doubt that significant
restrictions on disequilibrium adjustment
mechanisms can be deduced from first
principles.

Why are the wage aind salary rates of
employed workers so insensitive to the
availability of potential replacements?
One reason is that the employer makes
some explicit or implicit commitments in
putting a worker on the payroll in the
first place. The employee expects that his
wages and terms of employment will
steadily improve, certainly never retrogress.
He expects that the employer will
pay him the rate prevailing for persons of
comparable skill, occupation, experience,
and seniority. He expects such commitments
in return for his own investments in
the job; arrangements for residence, transportation,
and personal life involve set-up
costs which will be wasted if the job turns
sour. The market for labor services is not
like a market for fresh produce where the
entire current supply is auctioned daily.
It is more like a rental housing market,
in which most existing tenancies are the
continuations of long-term relationships
governed by contracts or less formal understandings.


Employers and workers alike regard the
wages of comparable labor elsewhere as a
standard, but what determines those reference
wages? There is not even an auction
where workers and employers unbound by
existing relationships and commitments
meet and determine a market-clearing
wage. If such markets existed, they would
provide competitively determined guides
for negotiated and administered wages,
just as stock exchange prices are reference
points for stock transactions elsewhere.
In labor markets the reverse is closer to
the truth. Wage rates for existing employees
set the standards for new employees,
too.

The equilibrium components of wage
increases, it has been argued, depend on
past wage increases throughout the economy.
In those theoretical and econometric
models of inflation where labor
markets are aggregated into a single
market, this relationship is expressed as
an autoregressive equation of fixed structure:
current wage increase depends on
past wage increases. The same description
applies when past wage increases enter indirectly,
mediated by price inflation and
productivity change. The process of mutual
interdependence of market wages is a
good deal more complex and less mechanical
than these aggregated models suggest.
Reference standards for wages differ
from market to market. The equilibrium
wage increase in each market will be some
function of past wages in all markets, and
perhaps of past prices too. But the function
need not be the same in every market.
Wages of workers contiguous in geography
industry, and skill will be heavily weighted.
Imagine a wage pattern matrix of coefficients
describing the dependence of the
percentage equilibrium wage increase in
each market on the past increases in all
other markets. The coefficients in each row
are non-negative and sum to one, but their
distribution across markets and time lags
will differ from row to row.

Consider the properties of such a system
in the absence of disequilibrium inputs.
First, the system has the "natural rate"
property that its steady state is indeterminate.
Any rate of wage increase that has
been occurring in all markets for a long
enough time will continue. Second, from
irregular initial conditions the system will


### ---Economics-1972-0-15.txt---
move toward one of these steady states,
but which one depends on the specifics of
the wage pattern matrix and the initial
conditions. Contrary to some pessimistic
warnings, there is nro arithmetic compulsion
that makes the whole system gravitate
in the direction of its most inflationary
sectors. The ultimate steady state inflation
will be at most that of the market
with the highest initial inflation rate, and
at least that of the market with the lowest
initial inflation rate. It need not be equal
to the average inflation rate at the beginning,
but may be either greater or

smaller. Third, the adjustment paths are
likely to contain cyclical conmponents,
damped or at most of constant amplitude,
and during adjustments both individual
and average wage movements may diverge
substantially in both directions from
their ultimate steady state value. Fourth,
since wage decisions and negotiations
occur infrequently, relative wage adjustments
involve a lot of catching up and
leap-frogging, and probably take a long
time. I have sketched the formal properties
of a disaggregated wage pattern system
of this kind simply to stress again the
vast simplification of the one-market
myth.

A system in which only relative magnitudes
matter has only a neutral equilibrium,
from which it can be permanently
displaced by random shocks. Even when a
market is in equilibrium, it may outdo the
recent wage increases in related markets. A
shock of this kind, even though it is not
repeated, raises permanently the steady
state inflation rate. This is true cost-push
-inflation generated neither by previous
inflation nor by current excess demand.
Shocks, of course, may be negative as well
as positive. For example, upward pushes
arising from adjustments in relative wage
levels will be reversed when those adjustments
are completed.

To the extent that one man's reference
wages are another man's wages, there is
something arbitrary and conventional,
indeterminate and unstable, in the process
of wage setting. In the same current market
circumstances, the reference pattern
might be 8 percent per year or 3 percent
per year or zero, depending on the historical
prelude. Market conditions, unemployment
and vacancies and their distributions,
shape history and alter reference
patterns. But accidental circumstances
affecting stragetic wage settlements
also cast a long shadow.

Price inflation, as previously observed,
is a neutral method of making arbitrary
money wage paths conform to the realities
of productivity growth, neutral in preserving
the structure of relative wages.
If expansion of aggregate demand brings
both more inflation and more employment,
there need be no mystery why unemployed
workers accept the new jobs,

or why employed workers do not vacate
theirs. They need not be victims of ignorance
or inflation illusion. They genuinely
want more work at feasible real wages,
and they also want to maintain the relative
status they regard as proper and just.
Guideposts could be in principle the
functional equivalent of inflation, a neutral
method of reconciling wage and productivity
paths. The trick is to find a

formula for mutual deescalation which
does not offend conceptions of relative
equity. No one has devised a way of
controlling average wage rates without
intervening in the competitive struggle
over relative wages. Inflation lets this
struggle proceed and blindly, impartially,
impersonally, and nonpolitically scales
down all its outcomes. There are worse
methods of resolving grotup rivalries and
social conflict.

V. The Role of Monopoly Power

Probably the most popular explanation
of the inflationary bias of the economy is
concentration of economic power in large
corporations and unions. These powerful


### ---Economics-1972-0-16.txt---
monopolies and oligopolies, it is argued,
are immune from competition in setting
wages and prices. The unions raise wages
above competitive rates, with little regard
for the unemployed and under-employed
workers knocking at the gates. Perhaps
the unions are seeking a bigger share of
the revenues of the monopolies and
oligopolies with whom they bargain. But
they don't really succeed in that objective,
because the corporations simply pass the
increased labor costs, along with mark-ups,
on to their helpless customers. The remedy,
it is argued, is either atomization of big
business and big labor or strict public
control of their prices and wages.
So simple a diagnosis is vitiated by confusion
between levels and rates of change.
Monopoly power is no doubt responsible
for the relatively high prices and wages of
some sectors. But can the exercise of
monopoly power generate ever-rising price
and wages? Monopolists have no reason
to hold reserves of unexploited power.
But if they did, or if events awarded them
new power, their exploitation of it would
raise their real prices and wages only
temporarily.

Particular episodes of inflation may be
associated with accretions of monopoly
power, or with changes in the strategies
and preferences of those who possess it.
Among the reasons that wages and prices
rose in the face of mass unemployment
after 1933 were NRA codes and other
early New Deal measures to suppress competition,
and the growth of trade union

membership and power under the protection
of new federal legislation. Recently
we have witnessed substantial gains in the
powers of organized public employees.
Unions elsewhere may not have gained
power, but some of them apparently have
changed their objectives in favor of wages
at the expense of employment.

One reason for the popularity of the
monopoly power diagnosis of inflation is
the identification of administered prices
and wages with concentrations of economic
power. When price and wage increases are
the outcomes of visible negotiations and
decisions, it seems obvious that identifiable
firms and unions have the power to affect
the course of inflation. But the fact that
monopolies, oligopolies, and large unions
have discretion does not mean it is invariably
to their advantage to use it to
raise prices and wages. Nor are administered
prices and wages found only in
high concentration sectors. Very few prices
and wages in a modern economy, even in
the more competitive sectors, are determined
in Walrasian auction markets.

No doubt there has been a secular increase
in the prevalence of administered
wages and prices, connected with the relative
decline of agriculture and other sectors
of self-employment. This development
probably has contributed to the
inflationary bias of. the economy, by enlarging
the number of labor markets

where the response of money wages to
excess supply is slower than their response
to excess demand. The decline of agriculture
as a sector of flexible prices and wages
and as an elastic source of industrial labor
is probably an important reason why the
Phillips trade off problem is worse now
than in the 1920's. Sluggishness of response
to excess supply is a feature of
administered prices, whatever the market
structure, but it may be accentuated by
concentration of power per se. For example,
powerful unions, not actually

forced by competition to moderate their
wage demands, may for reasons of internal
politics be slow to respond to unemployment
in their ranks.

VI. Some Reflections on Policy
If the makers of macro-economic policy
could be sure that the zero-inflation rate
of unemployment is natural, voluntary,
and optimal, their lives would be easy.


### ---Economics-1972-0-17.txt---
Friedman told us that all macro-economic
policy needs to do, all it should try to do, is
to make nominal national income grow
steadily at the natural rate of growth of
aggregate supply. This would sooner or
later result in price stability. Steady price
deflation would be even better, he said,
because it would eliminate the socially
wasteful incentive to economize money
holdings. In either case, unemployment
will converge to its natural rate, and
wages and prices will settle into steady
trends. Under this policy, whatever unemployment
the market produces is the correct
result. No tradeoff, no choice, no
agonizing decisions.

I have argued this evening that a substantial
amount of the unemployment

compatible with zero inflation is involuntary
an(l nonoptimal. This is, in my
opinion, true whether or not the inflations
associated with lower rates of unemployment
are steady or ever-accelerating.
Neither macro-economic policy makers,
nor the elected officials and electorates to
whom they are responsible, can avoid
weighing the costs of unemployment
against those of inflation. As Phelps has
pointed out, this social choice has an intertemporal
dimension. The social costs of
involutionary unemployment are mostly
obvious and immediate. The social costs
of inflation come later.

What are they? Economists' answers
have been remarkably vague, even though
the prestige of the profession has reinforced
the popular view that inflation leads
ultimately to catastrophe. Here indeed is
aT case where abstract economic theory
has a powerful hold on public opinion
and policy. The prediction that at low
unemployment rates inflation will accelerate
toward ultimate disaster is a theoretical
deduction with little empirical
support. In fact the weight of econometric
evidence has been against acceleration,
let alone disaster. Yet the deduction has
been convincing enough to persuade this
country to give up billions of dollars of
annual output and to impose sweeping
legal controls on prices and wages. Seldom
has a society made such large immediate
and tangible sacrifices to avert an ill defined,
uncertain, eventual evil.

According to economic theory, the
ultimate social cost of anticipated inflation
is the wasteful use of resources to
economize holdings of currency and other
noninterest-bearing means of payment.
I suspect that intelligent laymen would
be utterly astounded if they realized that
this is the great evil economists are talking
about. They have imagined a much more
devastating cataclysm, with Vesuvius
vengefully punishing the sinners below.
Extra trips between savings banks and
commercial banks? What an anti-climax!
With means of payment-currency plus
demand deposits-equal currently to 20
percent of GNP, an extra percentage point
of anticipated inflation embodied in nominal
interest rates produces in principle a
social cost of 2/10 of I percent of GNP
per year. This is an outside estimate. An
unknown, but substantial, share of the
stock of money belongs to holders who are
not trying to economize cash balances and
are not near any margin where they would
be induced to spend resources for this purpose.
These include hoarders of large denomination
currency, about one-third of

the total currency in public hands, for
reasons of privacy, tax evasion, or illegal
activity. They include tradesmen and
consumers whose working balances turn
over too rapidly or are too small to justify
any effort to invest them in interestbearing
assets. They include corporations
who, once they have been induced to
undertake the fixed costs of a sharp-pencil
money management department, are already
minimizing their cash holdings.
They include businessmen who are in fact
being paid interest on demand deposits,


### ---Economics-1972-0-18.txt---
although it takes the form of preferential
access to credit and other bank services.
But, in case anyone still regards the waste
of resources in unnecessary transactions
between money and interest-bearing financial
assets as one of the major economic
problems of the day, there is a simple and
straightforward remedy, the payment of
interest on demand deposits and possibly,
with ingenuity, on currency too.
The ultimate disaster of inflation would
be the breakdown of the monetary payments
system, necessitating a currency
reform. Such episodes have almost invariably
resulted from real economic catastrophes-
wars, defeats, revolutions, reparations-
not from the mechanisms of

wage-price push with which we are concerned.
Acceleration is a scare word, conveying
the image of a rush into hyperinflation
as relentlessly deterministic and
monotonic as the motion of falling bodies.
Realistic attention to the disaggregated
and stochastic nature of wage and price
movements suggests that they will show
diverse and irregular fluctuations around
trends that are difficult to discern and
extrapolate. The central trends, history
suggests, can accelerate for a long, long
time without generating hyper-inflations
destructive of the payments mechanism.
Unanticipated inflation, it is contended,
leads to mistaken estimates of relative
prices and consequently to misallocations
of resources. An example we have already
discussed is the alleged misallocation of
time by workers who over-estimate their
real wages. The same error would lead to
a general over-supply by sellers who contract
for future deliveries without taking
correct account of the increasing prices of
the things they must buy in order to fulfill
the contract. Unanticipated deflation
would cause similar miscalculations and
misallocations. Indeed, people can make
these same mistakes about relative prices
even when the price level is stable. The
mistakes are more likely, or the more
costly to avoid, the greater the inflationary
trend. There are costs in setting
and announcing new prices. In an inflationary
environment price changes must
be made more frequently-a new catalog
twice a year instead of one, or some formula
for automatic escalation of announced
prices. Otherwise, with the interval
between announcements unchanged,
the average misalignment of relative prices
will be larger the faster the inflation. The
same problem would arise with rapid
deflation.

Unanticipated inflation and deflationand
unanticipated changes in relative
prices-are also sources of transfers of
wealth. I will not review here the rich and
growing empirical literature on this subject.
Facile generalizations about the progressivity
or equity of inflationary transfers
are hazardous; certainly inflation does
not merit the cliche that it is "the cruelest
tax." Let us not forget that unemployment
has distributional effects as well as deadweight
losses.

Some moralists take the view that the
government has promised to maintain the
purchasing power of its currency, but this
promise is their inference rather than any
pledge written on dollar bills or in the
Constitution. Some believe so strongly in
this implicit contract that they are willing
to suspend actual contracts in the name of
anti-inflation.

I have long contended that the government
should make low-interest bonds of
guaranteed purchasing power available
for savers and pension funds who wish to
avoid the risks of unforeseen inflation. The
common objection to escalated bonds is
that they would diminish the built-in
stability of the system. The stability in
question refers to the effects on aggregate
real demand, ceteris paribus, of a change in
the price level. The Pigou effect tells us
that government bondholders whose
wealth is diminished by inflation will spend
less. This brake on old-fashioned gap


### ---Economics-1972-0-19.txt---
inflation will be thrown away if the bonds
are escalated. These considerations are
only remotely related to the mechanisms of
wage and price inflation we have been
discussing. In the 1970's we know that the
government can, if it wishes, control
aggregate demand-at any rate, its ability
to do so is only trivially affected by the
presence or absence of Pigou effects on
part of the government debt.

In considering the intertemporal tradeoff,
we have no license to assume that the
natural rate of unemployment is independent
of the history of actual unemployment.
Students of human capital have
been arguing convincingly that earning
capacity, indeed transferable earning capacity,
depends on experience as well as
formal education. Labor markets soggy
enough to maintain price stability may
increase the number of would-be workers
who lack the experience to fit them for
jobs that become vacant.

Macro-economic policies, monetary and
fiscal, are incapable of realizing society's
unemployment and inflation goals simultaneously.
This dismal fact has long stimulated
a search for third instruments to do
the job: guideposts and incomes policies,
on the one hand, labor market and manpower
policies, on the other. Ten to fifteen
years ago great hopes were held for both.
The Commission on Money and Credit in
1961, pp. 39-40, hailed manpower policies
as the new instrument that would overcome
the unemployment-inflation dilemma.
Such advice was taken seriously in
Washington, and an unprecedented spurt
in manpower programs took place in the
1960's. The Council of Economic Advisers
set forth wage and price guideposts in
1961-62 in the hope of "talking down" the
Phillips curve (pp. 185-90). It is discouraging
to find that these efforts did not keep
the problem of inflationary bias from
becoming worse than ever.

So it is not with great confidence or
optimism that one suggests measures to
mitigate the tradeoff. But some proposals
follow naturally from the analysis, and
some are desirable in themselves anyway.
First, guideposts do not wholly deserve
the scorn that "toothless jawboning" often
attracts. There is an arbitrary, imitative
component in wage settlements, and maybe
it can be influenced by national standards.
Second, it is important to create jobs for
those unemployed and discouraged workers
who have extremely low probability of
meeting normal job specifications. Their
unemployment does little to discipline
wage increases, but reinforces their deprivation
of human capital and their other
disadvantages in job markets. The National
Commission on Technology, Automation
and Economic Progress pointed

out in 1966 the need for public service jobs
tailored to disadvantaged workers. They
should not be "last resort" or make-work
jobs, but regular permanent jobs capable
of conveying useful experience and inducing
reliable work habits. Assuming
that the additional services produced by
the employing institutions are of social
utility, it may well be preferable to employ
disadvantaged workers directly rather
than to pump up aggregate demand until
they reach the head of the queue.
Third, a number of measures could be
taken to make markets more responsive to
excess supplies. This is the kernel of truth
in the market-power explanation of inflationary
bias. In many cases, government
regulations themselves support prices and
wages against competition. Agricultural
prices and construction wages are wellknown
examples. Some trade unions follow
wage policies that take little or no account
of the interests of less senior members and
of potential members. Since unions operate
with federal sanction and protection, perhaps
some means can be found to insure
that their memberships are open and that
their policies are responsive to the unemployed
as well as the employed.

As for macro-economic policy, I have


### ---Economics-1972-0-20.txt---
argued that it should aim for unemployment
lower than the zero-inflation rate.
How much lower? Low enough to equate
unemployment and vacancies? We cannot
say. In the nature of the case there is no
simple formula-conceptual, much less.
statistical-for full employment. Society
cannot escape very difficult political and
intertemporal choices. We economists can
illuminate these choices as we learn more
about labor markets, mobility, and search,
and more about the social and distributive
costs of both unemployment and inflation.
Thirty-five years after Keynes, welfare
macroeconomics is still a relevant and
challenging subject. I dare to believe it has
a bright future.
 ## Economics-1973-0


### ---Economics-1973-0-03.txt---
The ceremonial address of the President
of the American Economic Association is
an art form which, I imagine like most of
my predecessors, I have thoughtfully reviewed.
On occasion, in the past, the addresses
have dealt with some substantive
problem of our subject or some afflicting
problem of the economy. More often they
have dealt, always a shade critically, with
the methodology of economics. While accepting
the larger science there has been
adverse comment on the detailed elements
of its practice. Economics is insufficiently
normative. Model building has become an
end, not a means. For several recent years
in succession the criticism-which involved
a certain element of personal introspection-
included an exceptionally grave
attack on mathematical economics. The
style of these addresses, I might note in
passing, is as distinctive as the subject
matter. It features the thoughtful solemnity
of men who sense that we are speaking
for the ages. It may be worth a moment's
time, on these great occasions, to recall
that ours is a subject which features defeated
expectations.

I am moved this evening to depart from
the established rites. I should like to concern
myself with basic questions of assumption
and structure. If this breaks with
tradition, it does not break with present
professional tendency. We meet at a time
when criticism is general when the larger
body of established theory is under extensive
attack. Within the last half-dozen
years what before was simply called economics
in the nonsocialist world has come
to be designated neoclassical economics
with appropriate overtures to the Keynesian
and post-Keynesian development.
From being a general and accepted theory
of economic behavior this has become a
special and debatable interpretation of
such behavior. For a new and notably
articulate generation of economists a reference
to neoclassical economics has become
markedly pejorative.

I would judge as well as hope that the
present attack will prove decisive. The
established theory has reserves of strength.
It sustains much minor refinement which
does not raise the question of overall
validity or usefuliness. It survives strongly
in the textbooks although even in this
stronghold one senses anxiety among the
more progressive or commercially sensitive
authors. Perhaps there are limits to
what the young will accept.

And the arrangements by which orthodoxy
is conserved in the modern academy
also remain formidable. In its first half
century or so as a subject of instruction
and research, economics was subject to
censorship by outsiders. Businessmen and
their political and ideological acolytes
kept watch on departments of economics
and reacted promptly to heresy, the latter
being anything that seemed to threaten
the sanctity of property, profits, a proper
tariff policy, a balanced budget, or which
involved sympathy for unions, public
ownership, public regulation or, in any
organized way, for the poor. The growing
power and self-confidence of the educational
estate, the formidable and growing
complexity of our subject and, no doubt,
the increasing acceptability of our ideas
has largely relieve(d us of this intervention.


### ---Economics-1973-0-04.txt---
In leading centers of instruction faculty
responsibility is either secure or increasingly
so. But in place of the old censorship
has come a new despotism. That consists in
defining scientific excellence as whatever is
closest in belief and method to the
scholarly tendency of the people who are
already there. This is a pervasive and
oppressive thing not the less dangerous for
being, in the frequent case, both selfrighteous
and unconscious.

But there are problems even with this
control. Neoclassical or neo-Keynesian
economics, though providing unlimited opportunity
for demanding refinement, has

a decisive flaw. It offers no useful handle
for grasping the economic problems that
now beset the modern society. And these
problems are obtrusive-they will not lie
down and die as a favor to our profession.
No arrangement for the perpetuation of
thought is secure if that thought does not
make contact with the problems that it is
presumed to solve.

I will not omit this evening to mention
the failures of neoclassical theory. But I
want also to urge the means by which we
can reassociate ourselves with reality.
Some of this will summarize past argument,
more a book that is presently to be
published. At this stage even the most conservative
among my listeners will be reassured.
To speak well of one's own published
and unpublished writing, whatever
one's other aberrations, is strongly in our
professional tradition.

I

The most commonplace features of neoclassical
and neo-Keynesian economics are
the assumptions by which power, and
therewith political content, is removed
from the subject. The business firm is subordinate
to the instruction of the market
and, thereby, to the individual or household.
The state is subordinate to the instruction
of the citizen. There are exceptions
but these are to the general and controlling
rule, and it is firmly on the rule
that neoclassical theory is positione(l. If
the business firm is subordinate to the
market--if that is its master--then it does
not have power to deploy in the economy
save as this is in the service of the market
and the consumer. And the winning of
action to influence or rig the behavior of
markets apart, it cannot bring power to
bear on the state for there the citizen is in
charge.

The decisive weakness in neoclassical
and neo-Keynesian economics is not the
error in the assumptions by which it elides
the problem of power. The capacity for
erroneous belief is very great, especially
where it coincides with convenience.
Rather in eliding power--in making economics
a nonpolitical subject---neoclassical
theory, by the same process, destroys
its relation with the real world. The problems
of this world, moreover, are increasing,
both in number and in the depth of their
social affliction. In consequence neoclassical
and neo-Keynesian economics is relegating
its players to the social sidelines
where they either call no plays or urge the
wrong ones.

Specifically the exclusion of power and
the resulting political content from economics
causes it to foretell only two intrinsic
and important economic problems.
One of these is the microeconomic problem
of market imperfection-more specifically
of monopoly or oligopoly in product or
factor markets leading to aberration in
resource and income distribution. The
other is the macroeconomic problem of unemployment
or inflation-of a deficiency

or excess in the aggregate demand for
goods and services, including that associated
with monetary effects. And on both
problems the failure is dramatic. Neoclassical
economics leads to the wrong

solution of the microeconomic problem
and to no solution of the macroeconomic


### ---Economics-1973-0-05.txt---
problem. Meanwhile it leaves a whole
galaxy of other urgent economic issues
largely untouched.

It is now the considered sense of the
community, even of economists when unhampered
by professional doctrine, that
the most prominent areas of market
oligopoly-automobiles, rubber, chemicals,
plastics, alcohol, tobacco, detergents,
cosmetics, computers, bogus health remedies,
space adventure-are areas not of
low but of high development, not of inadequate
but of excessive resource use.
And there is a powerful instinct that in
some areas of monopoly or oligopoly,
most notably in the production of weapons
and weapons systems, resource use is dangerously
vast.

In further contradiction of the established
microeconomic conclusions, we have
an increasing reaction by the community
to deficient resource use in industries that,
at least in the scale and structure of the
firm, approach the market model. Housing,
health services, and local transportation
are among the leading cases. The deprivation
and social distress that follow from
the poor performance of these industries
are also something that, in their nondoctrinal
manifestation, most economists take
for granted.

The defender of the established doctrine
does, of course, argue that excess and
deprivation in resource use in the areas
just mentioned reflect consumer choice.
And in the areas of deprivation he can
rightly insist that the fault lies with firms
that, though small, are local monopolies
or reflect the monopoly power of unions.
These explanations beg two remarkably
obvious questions: Why does the modern
consumer increasingly tend to insanity,
increasingly insist on self-abuse? And why
do little monopolies perform badly and the
big ones too well?

In fact the neoclassical model has no
explanation of the most important microeconomic
problem of our time. That problem
is why we have a highly unequal
development as between industries of
great market power and industries of
slight market power, with the development,
in defiance of all doctrine, greatly
favoring the first.1

The macroeconomic failure has been, if
anything, more embarrassing. Save in its
strictly mystical manifestation in one
branch of monetary theory, modern macroeconomic
policy depends for its validity
and workability on the neoclassical market.
That market, whether competitive,
monopolistic, or oligopolistic, is the ultimate
and authoritative instruction to the
profit-maximizing firm. When output and
employment are deficient, policy requires
that aggregate demand be increased; this
is an instruction to the market to which
firms in turn respond. When the economy
is at or near the effective capacity of the
plant and the labor force and inflation is
the relevant social discomfort, the remedy
is reversed. Demand is curtailed; the result
is either an initial effect on prices or a
delayed one as surplus labor seeks employment,
interest rates fall and lower

factor costs bring stable or lower prices.
Such is the accepted basis of policy. It
follows faithfully from the neoclassical
faith in the market. The practical consequences
of pursuing it need no elucidation.
It has been tried in recent years in
every developed country. The common
result has been politically unacceptable
unemployment, persistent and (in my
view) socially damaging inflation or, more
often, a combination of the two. The extreme
failure has been, not surprisingly,
in the most advanced industrial country,


### ---Economics-1973-0-06.txt---
the United States. But the recent experience
of Britain has been almost equally
disenchanting. One gathers that there may
be Canadian politicians who now believe
that a combination of unemployment and
inflation is not the best platform on which
to fight a general election.

We should not deny ourselves either the
instruction or the amusement that comes
from the recent history of the United
States in this matter. Four years ago Mr.
Nixon came to office with a firm commitment
to neoclassical orthodoxy. In this he
was supported by some of its most distinguished
and devout exponents in all the
land. His subsequent discovery that he
was a Keynesian involved no precipitate
or radical departure from this faith. The
discovery came thirty-five years after The
General Theory; as I have just noted, all
neo-Keynesian policy rests firmly on the
paramount role of the market. But then a
year and. a half ago, facing reelection, he
found that his economists' comnmitment
to neoclassical and Keynesian orthodoxy,
however admirable in the abstract, was a
luxury that he could no longer afford. He
apostatized to wage and price control; so,
with exemplary flexibility of mind, did
his economists although admittedly this
acceptance of the real world has still to
survive its critical test which is the
apostates' return to computers and classrooms.
But our admiration for this pliability
should not keep us from recalling that,
when the President changed course, no
American economists were anywhere
working on the policy he was forced by
circumstances to adopt. And it is even
more disturbing that few are now working
on the policy which we have been forced
to follow.

More economists, in fact, are still concerning
themselves with the effort to reconcile
controls with the neoclassical
market. This has involved an unrewarding
combination of economics and archeology
with wishful thinking. It holds that an
inflationary momentum developed during
the late 1960's in connection with the
financing--or underfinancing of the Vietnam
war. And inflationary expectation
became part of business and trade union
calculation. The momentum and expectation
still survive. The controls are necessary
until these are dissipated. Then the
neoclassical and neo-Keynesian world will
return, along with the appropriate policies,
in all their quiet comfort. We may be sure
that will not happen. Nor will we expect it
to happen if we see the role of power and
political decision in modern economic behavior.


II

In place of the market system, we must
now assume that for approximately half of
all economic output there is a power or
planning system. (The latter term seems
to me more descriptive, less pejorative and
thus preferable.) The planning system consists
in the United States of, at the most,
2,000 large corporations. In their operation
they have power that transcends the
market. They rival where they do not
borrow from the power of the state. My
views on these matters will be familiar at
least to some, and I shall spare myself the
pleasure of extensive repetition. I cannot
think that the power of the modern corporation,
the purposes for which it is used
or the associated power of the moclern
union would seem implausible or even very
novel were they not in conflict with the
vested (loctrine.

Thus we agree that the modern corporation,
either by itself or in conjunction
with others, has extensive influence over
its prices and its major costs. Can we
doubt that it goes beyond its prices and
the market to persuade its customers? Or
that it goes back of its costs to organize
supply? Or that from its earnings or the
possession of financial afiliates it seeks to


### ---Economics-1973-0-07.txt---
control its sources of capital? Or that its
persuasion of the consumer joined with the
similar effort of other firms and with the
more than incidental blessing of neoclassical
pedagogy helps establish the values
of the community, notably the association
between well-being and the progressively
increased consumption of the products of
this part of the economy?

And as citizens, if not as scholars, we
would not deny that the modern corporation
has a compelling position in the
modern state. What it needs in research
and development, technically qualified
people, public works, emergency financial
support, becomes public policy. So does the
military procurement that sustains the
demand for numerous of its products. So,
perhaps, does the foreign policy that
justifies the military procurement. And
the means by which this power is brought
to bear on the state is widely accepted. It
requires an organization to deal with an
organization. And between public and
private bureaucracies between GM and
the Department of Transportation, General
Dynamics and the Pentagon there is
a deeply symbiotic relationship. Each of
these organizations can do much for the
other. There is even, between them, a
large and continuous interchange of executive
personnel.

Finally over this exercise of power and
much enhancing it is the rich gloss of
reputability. The men who guide the
modern corporation, including the financial,
legal, technical, advertising, and other
sacerdotal authorities in corporate function,
are the most respectable, affluent,
and prestigious members of the national
community. They are the Establishment.
Their interest tends to become the public
interest. It is an interest that even some
economists find it comfortable and rewarding
to avow.

That interest, needless to say, is profoundly
concerned with power with wining
acceptance by others of the collective
or corporate purpose. It does not disavow
profits. These are important for ensuring
the autonomy of the management what
I have called the technostructure and for
bringing the supply of capital within the
control of the firm. Profits are also a
source of prestige and therewith of influence.
But of paramount importance is the
much more directly political goal of
growth. Such growth carries a strong economic
reward; it directly enhances the
pay, perquisites, and opportunities for
promotion of the members of the technostructure.
And it consolidates and enhances
authority. It does this for the individualfor
the man who now heads a larger
organization or a larger part of an organization
than before. And it increases the
influence of the corporation as a whole.
Neoclassical economics is not without an
instinct for survival. It rightly sees the
unmanaged sovereignty of the consumer,
the ultimate sovereignty of the citizen and
the maximization of profits and resulting
subordination of the firm to the market
as the three legs of a tripod on which it
stands. These are what exclude the role of
power in the system. All three propositions
tax the capacity for belief. That the
modern consumer is the object of a massive
management effort by the producer is not
readily denied. The methods of such management,
by their nature, are embarrassingly
visible. It can only be argued that
somehow it all cancels out. Elections in
the United States and Canada are now
being fought on the issue of the subordination
of the state to corporate interest. As
voters, economists accept the validity of
the issue. Only their teaching denies it.
But the commitment of the modern corporate
bureaucracy to its expansion is, perhaps,
the clearest of all. That the modern
conglomerate always pursues profit over
aggrandizement is believed by none. It is a
commonplace of these last years, strongly


### ---Economics-1973-0-08.txt---
reflected in securities' prices, that agglomeration
has always been good for growth
but often bad for earnings.

There remains in the modern economyand
this I stress a world of small firms
where the instruction of the market is still
paramount, where costs are given, where
the state is remote and subject through the
legislature to the traditional pressures of
economic interest groups and where profit
maximization alone is consistent with survival.
We should not think of this as the
classically competitive part of the system
in contrast with the monopolistic or
oligopolistic sector from which the planning
system has evolved. Rather, in its
combination of competitive and monopolistic
structures, it approaches the entire
neoclassical model. We have, to repeat,
two systems. In one, power is still, as ever,
contained by the market. In another and
still evolving system, power extends incompletely
but comprehensively to markets,
to the people who patronize them, to
the state and thus, ultimately, to resource
use. The coexistence of these two systems
becomes, in turn, a major clue to economic
performance.

III

Power being so comprehensively deployed
in a very large part of the total economy,
there can no longer, except for reasons
of game-playing or more deliberate
intellectual evasion, be any separation by
economists between economics and politics.
When the modern corporation acquires
power over markets, power in the
community, power over the state, power
over belief, it is a political instrument,
different in form and degree but not in
kind from the state itself. To hold otherwise
to deny the political character of
the modern corporation is not merely to
avoid the reality. It is to disguise the reality.
The victims of that disguise are those
we instruct in error. The beneficiaries are
the institutions whose power we so disguise.
Let there be no question: Economics,
so long as it is thus taught, becomes,
however unconsciously, a part of an
arrangement by which the citizen or
student is kept from seeing how he is, or
will be, governed.

This does not mean that economics now
becomes a branch of political science. That
is a prospect by which we would rightly be
repelled. Political science is also the captive
of its stereotypes including that of citizen
control of the state. Also while economics
cherishes thought, at least in principle,
political science regularly accords reverence
to the man who knows only what has
been done before. Economics does not become
a part of political science. But
politics does and must become a part of
economics.

There will be fear that once we abandon
present theory, with its intellectually
demanding refinement and its increasing
instinct for measurement, we shall lose the
filter by which scholars are separated from
charlatans and windbags. These latter are
always a danger, but there is more danger
in remaining with a world that is not real.
And we shall be surprised, I think, at the
new clarity and intellectual consistency
with which we see our world, once power is
made a part of our system. To such a view
let me now turn.

IV

In the neoclassical view of the economy
a general identity of interest between
the goals of the business firm and those
of the community could be assumed. The
firm was subject to the instruction of
the community, either through the market
or the ballot box. People could not be fundamentally
in conflict with themselvesalways
given some reasonable decency in
income distribution. Once the firm in the
planning system is seen to have comprehensive
power to pursue its own interest,


### ---Economics-1973-0-09.txt---
this assumption becomes untenable. Perhaps
by accident its interests are those of
the public but there is no organic reason
why this must be so. In the absence of
proof to the contrary, divergence of interest,
not identity of interest, must be
assumed.

The nature of the conflict also becomes
predictable. Growth being a principal goal
of the planning system it will be great
where power is great. And in the market
sector of the economy, growth will, at least
by comparison, be deficient. This will not,
as neoclassical doctrine holds, be because
people have an amiable tendency to misunderstand
their needs. It will be because
the system is so constructed as to serve
badly their needs and then to win greater
or less acquiescence in the result. That the
present system should lead to an excessive
output of automobiles, an improbable
effort to cover the economically developed
sections of the planet with asphalt, a lunar
preoccupation with moon exploration, a
fantastically expensive and potentially
suicidal investment in missiles, submarines,
bombers, and aircraft carriers, is as one
would expect. These are the industries
with power to command resources for
growth. And central to public purpose
to sound resource utilization will be a
cutback in such industries, as all instinct
now suggests. Thus does the introduction
of power as a comprehensive aspect of our
system correct present error. Let us not
fail to note that these are exactly the industries
in which an uncomplicated neoclassical
view of monopoly and oligopoly
and of profit maximization at the expense
of ideal resource use would, of all things,
suggest an expansion of output. How
wrong are we allowed to be!

The counterpart of excessive resource
use in the planning system where power is
comprehensively deployed is a relatively
deficient resource use where power is circumscribed.
Such will be the case in the

part of the economy where competition
and entrepreneurial monopoly as distinct
from great organization are the rule. And
if the product or service is closely related
to comfort or survival, the discontent will
be considerable. That housing, health
services, local transportation, some household
services, are now areas of grave inadequacy
is agreed. It is in such industries
that all modern governments seek to expand
resource use. Here, in desperation,
even the devout free enterprisers accept
the need for social action, even of socialism.


Again, we may observe, the error of
economics is prejudicial. Although as
citizens we advocate restraint in the area
of excessive resource use, our teaching does
not. And though as citizens we urge social
action where the firm approaches the neoclassical
norm, our teaching does not. In
this latter case we not only disguise corporate
power but we make remedial action
in such areas as housing, health care,
transportation, also abnormal the consequence
of sui generis error that is never
quite explained. This is unfortunate for
here are tasks that require imagination,
pride and determination.

When power is admitted to our calculus,
our macroeconomic embarrassment also
disappears. Economics makes plausible
what governments are forced, in practice,
to do. Corporations have power in their
markets. So, and partly in consequence, do
unions. The competitive claims of unions
can most conveniently be resolved by passing
the cost of settlement along to the
public. Measures to arrest this exercise of
power by limiting aggregate demand must
be severe. And, not surprisingly, the power
of the planning system has been brought to
bear to exclude those macroeconomic measures
that have a primary effect on that
system. Thus monetary policy is entirely


### ---Economics-1973-0-10.txt---
permissible; that is at least partly because
its primary effect is on the neoclassical
entrepreneur who must borrow money.
Monetary constraint is far less painful
for the large established corporation which,
as an elementary exercise of power, has
ensured itself a supply of capital from
earnings or financial affiliates or morally
affiliated banks. The power of the planning
system in the community has also won
immunity for public expenditures important
to itself-highways, industrial research,
rescue loans, national defense.
These have the sanction of a higher public
purpose. A similar if still slightly less successful
effort is being made on behalf of
corporate and personal taxes. So fiscal
policy has also been accommodated to the
interests of the planning system.
Thus the inevitability of controls. The
interaction of corporate and trade union
power can be made to yield only to the
strongest fiscal and monetary restraints.
Those restraints that are available have a
comparatively benign effect on those with
power, but they weigh adversely on people
who vote. When no election is in prospect,
perhaps such a policy is possible. It will
earn applause for its respectability. But it
cannot be tolerated by anyone who must
weigh its popular effect.

As with the need for social action and
organization in the market sector there
are many reasons why it would be well
were economists to accept the inevitability
of wage and price control. It would help
keep politicians, responding to the resonance
of their own past instruction, from
supposing controls to be wicked and unnatural
and hence temporary and to be

abandoned whenever they seemed to be
working. This is a poor mood in which to
develop sound administration. And it
would cause economists themselves to
consider how controls can be made workable
and how the effect on income distribution
can be made equitable. With controls
this last becomes a serious matter.
The market is no longer a disguise for
inequality, however egregious, in income
distribution. Much inequality must
be seen to be the result of relative power.
VI

When power is made part of our system,
yet other matters of considerable current
moment are illuminated. Thus the counterpart
of systemic differences in development
as between the planning and market sectors
of the economy is systemic sectoral
differences in income. In the neoclassical
system, resource mobility is assumed,
broadly speaking, to equalize inter-industry
return. If there is inequality, it is
the result of barriers to movement. Now
we see that, given its comprehensive market
power, the planning system can protect
itself from adverse movements in its terms
of trade. The same power allows it to
accept unions for it need not absorb even
temporarily their demands. In the market
system, some areas of monopoly or union
power apart, there is no similar control of
the terms of trade. Given the absence of
market power there can be no similar
yielding on wage costs for there is no
similar certainty that they can be passed
on. (It is because of the character of the
industry he seeks to organize, not his
original power, that Cesar Chavez is for so
many the new Lenin.) And, in the market
system, the self-employed have the option
not present in the planning system of
reducing their own wages (and sometimes
those of families or immediate employees)
in order to survive.

Thus there is a built-in inequality in
income between the two systems. And
thus also the case for minimum wage
legislation, support to trade unions in
agriculture, price support legislation, and
most important, perhap5, a floor under
family income as antidotes to such interindustry


### ---Economics-1973-0-11.txt---
inequality. Again this view of
matters fits our present concerns. Minimum
wage legislation, price support
legislation, and support to collective bargaining
are all questions of continuing
political controversy as they apply to
small business and agriculture. They are
not serious issues in highly organized industry
in the planning system. And the
question of a floor under family income, a
matter of intense political argumeint, has
recently divided workers in the planning
system who would not be beneficiaries
from those in the market system who
would be. Again there is reassurance in a
view of the economy that prepares us for
the politics of our time.

The inclusion of power in economic calculus
also prepares us for the great debate
over the environment. It is the claim of
neoclassical economics that it foresaw
possible environmental consequences from
economic development-that it, some
time ago, embraced the concept of external
diseconomies of production and, by inference,
of consumption. Alas, this is a modest
claim. The noninclusion of external diseconomies
was long viewed as a minor

defect of the price system-an afterthought
for an hour's classroom discussion.
And, as E. J. Mishan has observed,
it was largely ignored in the textbooks.
Nor does the notion of external diseconomies
now offer a useful remedy. No one
can suppose, or really supposes, that more
than a fraction of the damage especially
that to the beauty and tranquility of our
surroundings -could be compensated in
any useful way by internalizing external
diseconomies.

If growth is the central and rewarding
purpose of the firm and if power is comprehensively
available to impose this goal

on the society, the possibility of conflict
between private growth and public purpose
as regards the environment is immediately
plausible. So, since this power
depends extensively not on force but
persuasion, is the effort to make pollution
seem palatable or worth the cost, including
the effort to nmake advertising of remedial
action a substitute for action. And so is the
remedy to which all industrial countries
are being forced. This is not, primarily, to
internalize external diseconomies. Rather
it is to specify the legal parameters within
which growth may proceed or, as in the
case of automobile use in central cities,
airplane use over urban areas, the SST,
industrial, commercial, and residential
appropriation of countryside andI roadside,
the kinds of growth that are inconsistent
with public purpose. We would have saved
much corruption of our surroundings if
our economics had held such action to be
the predictable consequence of the pursuit
of present economic goals and not the
exceptional result of a peculiar aberration
of the price system.

We had best, in any case, have the right
guide to action for the future for there is a
strong conservative case for such guidance.
While economists toy weakly with external
diseconomies, others are arguing
that growth itself is the villain. They are
seeking its extinction. To see environmental
damage as a natural consequence
of planning power and purpose and to see,
in consequence, the need for confining
growth within parameters that protect the
public interest could be important for ensuring
continued economic growth.

Finally, when power becomes part of our
system, so does Ralph Nader. We are
prepared for the explosion of concern now
called consumerism. If the consumer is the
ultimate source of authority, his abuse is
an occasional fault. He cannot be fundamentally
at odds with an economic system
that he commands. But if the producing
firm has comprehensive power and purposes
of its own, there is every likelihood
of conflict. Technology is then subordinate
to the strategy of consumer persuasion.


### ---Economics-1973-0-12.txt---
Products are changed not to make them
better but to take advantage of the belief
that what is new is better. There is a
high failure rate in engineering not what is
better but what can be sold. The consumer-
the unpersuaded or disenchanted
consumer rebels. This is not a rebellion
against minor matters of fraud or misinformation.
It is a major reaction against a
whole deployment of power by which the
consumer is made the instrument of purposes
that are not his own.

VII

There are two conclusions to which this
exercise-to which incorporation of power
into our system compels us. The first, in
a way, is encouraging. It is that economists'
work is not yet done. On the contrary,
it is just beginning. If we accept the
reality of power as part of our system, we
have years of useful work ahead of us.
And since we will be in touch with real
issues, and since issues that are real inspire
passion, our life will, again, be pleasantly
contentious, perhaps even usefully dangerous.


The other conclusion concerns the state.
For when we make power and therewith
politics a part of our system, we can no
longer escape or disguise the contradictory
character of the modern state. The state is
the prime object of economic power. It is
captured. Yet on all the matters I have
mentioned the restrictions on excessive
resource use, organization to offset inadequate
resource use, controls, action to
correct systemic inequality, protection of
the environment, protection of the consumer-
remedial action lies with the state.
The fox is powerful in the management of
the coop. To this management the chickens
must look for redress.

Thus perhaps our greatest question. Is
emancipation of the state from the control
of the planning system possible? No one
knows. And in the absence of knowledge
no one certainly will suggest that it will be
easy. But there is a gleam of encouragement.
As ever circumstances are forcing
the pace.

In the United States the recent election
was fought, all but exclusively, over issues
in which the purposes of the planning system
or its major participants diverge from
those of the public. The question of
defense expenditures is such an issue. That
of tax reform is another. The deprivation
in housing, mass transportation, health
services, city services, is yet another-one
that reflects the relative inability of these
industries to organize and command resources.
The question of a guaranteed

income is another such issue. Its effect, as
I have noted, is on incomes outside the
planning system on the exploited in the
market system, those who are rejected by
both. The environment is such an issuewith
its conflict between the technostructure'
s goal of growth and the public concern
for its surroundings. Only wage and
price control was not an issue in the recent
election. That was almost certainly because
economists of orthodox tendency
on both sides found the prospect too embarrassing
to discuss.

I do not mention these issues with any
purpose save to show that the questions
that emerge when power is made a part of
our calculus are present and real. We need
hardly remind ourselves that political
issues are made not by parties and politicians
but by circumstance.

Once power is made part of our system,
we will not of course escape the political
contention that comes from dealing with
issues that are real. This brings me to my
last point. I do not plead for partisanship
in our economics but for neutrality. But
let us be clear as to what is neutral. If the
state must be emancipated from economic
interest, a neutral economics would not
deny the need. This is what economics now


### ---Economics-1973-0-13.txt---
does. It tells the young and susceptible
and the old and vulnerable that economic
life has no content of power and politics
because the firm is safely subordinate to
the market and to the state and for this
reason it is safely at the command of the
consumer and citizen. Such an economics
is not neutral. It is the influential and invaluable
ally of those whose exercise of
power depends on an acquiescent public.
If the state is the executive committee of
the great corporation and the planning
system, it is partly because neoclassical
economics is its instrument for neutralizing
suspicion that this is so. I have spoken
of the emancipation of the state from economic
interest. For the economist there
can be no doubt as to where this task begins.
It is with the emancipation of economic
belief.

### ---Economics-1974-0-03.txt---
The content of presidential addresses to
this Association provides a fine example of
a random variable with a high variance. It
might even be a good subject for econometric
analysis; the variation might be
explained in terms of the economic conditions
of the moment, previous intellectual
investments, or even, for boldly interdisciplinary
analysis, the psychological states
or class origins of the speakers or the
audience. But no doubt captious theorists
like myself will object that the endogenous
variable is not cardinally measurable and
probably not even ordinally measurable;
tougher-minded econometricians will worry
about collinearity in the predetermined
variables; and practical-minded policy
analysts will see no discernible effect on
the gross national product, the price level,
or the balance of payments through effects
on either fiscal policy or the stock of
money. The last group, the policy-oriented,
are perhaps the least accurate; at least
according to Keynes, the effect of ideas on
policy is dominant, though the lag may be
as variable as and a good deal longer than
that of the stock of money on money gross
national product.

It is now more fashionable than it used
to be for statisticians to be told to take a
good look at their data before fitting
models. Taking presidential addresses as
our data, we find most frequently a review
of the speaker's main research concerns
but also expressions of methodological or
ethical concerns, historical surveys of varying
degrees of erudition and humor, and,
least frequently, new points of view on signifi-
cant problems of economics.

I am taking a somewhat different tack
today; it will be an expression of discontents
and expectations. As I shall try to
argue, the uncertainties about economics
are rooted in our need for a better understanding
of the economics of uncertainty;
our lack of economic knowledge is, in good
part, our difficulty in modelling the ignorance
of the economic agent.

Critical aspects of this need for reorientation
of theory have been recognized by
many scholars in the last quarter-century
and particularly in the last decade. I view
my remarks today as a summary and perspective
on a widely shared development
of thinking.

The starting point of discussion must
still be the much-abused neoclassical
theory. No really cohesive alternative
which aspires to the same level of completeness
exists. The neoclassical model is
founded on two concepts, which are considerably
different in nature. One is the
notion of the individual economic agent,
whose behavior is governed by a criterion
of optimization under constraints which
are partly peculiar to the agent, such as
production functions, and partly terms of
trade with the economic system as a whole.


### ---Economics-1974-0-04.txt---
The other is the market; here, the aggregate
of individual decisions is acknowledged,
and the terms of trade adjusted until
the decisions of the individuals are
mutually consistent in the aggregate, i.e.,
supply equals demand.

The neoclassical theory, especially in its
competitive form, can be and has been
given a rich formal development. Parenthetically,
one cause for the persistence of
neoclassical theory in the face of its long
line of critics is precisely that for some
reason of mathematical structure, the neoclassical
theory is highly manipulable and
flexible; when faced with a specific issue,
it can yield meaningful implications relatively
easily. Although I intend to air
complaints and desires for change today,
I must express my unabashed admiration
for the accomplishments of the neoclassical
viewpoint. In its most formal statement,
we simply use for analysis the equilibrium
conditions of the individual agent and of
the market, without inquiry as to how they
come to hold. Yet even these statements
turn out to yield revealing insights in the
workings of resource allocation. Why have
medical costs risen so rapidly relative to
other prices since 1967? The upward shift
in demand due to Medicare and Medicaid
with a price-inelastic supply of physicians
and hospitals provides a simple straightforward
answer; I cannot really imagine
how a Marxian or a neo-Ricardian would
even approach the question, though I suppose
they might dismiss it as unimportant.
The explanation of environmental problems
as due to the nonexistence of markets
is similarly an insight of purely neoclassical
origin. The now-demonstrated fact that
flexible exchange rates are a feasible way
of conducting international finance is a
triumph of theoretical insights over practical
men's convictions. More broadly, the
shifts in long-run resource allocation as
motivated by returns and, in particular,
the absence of a secular trend in technological
unemployment to the perpetual

surprise of the layman fit in well with the
neoclassical formulation but have no ready
explanation in alternate models.
Of course, the implications of neoclassical
theory have also been conspicuously
falsified in important ways. Most notably,
the recurrent periods of unemployment
which have characterized the history of
capitalism are scarcely compatible with a
neoclassical model of market equilibrium.
A post-Keynesian world in which unemployment
is avoided or kept at tolerable
levels by recurrent alterations in fiscal or
monetary policy is no more explicable by
neoclassical axioms, though the falsification
is not as conspicuous.

Inequality in economic development
among countries and among groups and
regions within a country provides a second,
somewhat complicated difficulty for neoclassical
theory. A purely neoclassical answer
would explain differences in per
capita income by differences in physical
and human assets per capita. This of
course raises the further question, how
this came to be, a question which would
require a fully dynamic model to answer;
but I think the more compelling problem
is that the differences in income seem
much too vast to be explained by factor
differences. Indeed, in the presence of international
trade and especially international
capital movements, wage differences
should be very strongly reduced compared
with what would occur in autarchic states
where domestic capital is the limiting factor.
Hence, we come immediately to the
explanation that there are differences in
the production possibility sets of the
different countries. This conclusion is a
legitimate and important use of neoclassical
analysis; but obviously it raises new
questions, to which we will return.
I pass by the whole tangle of questions
relating to the holding of money and the
general level of prices. In its pure form,


### ---Economics-1974-0-05.txt---
neoclassical theory is a theory of relative
prices. Monetary theories vaguely related
to it in spirit can be grafted on to it, but
none have succeeded in achieving a
genuine synthesis.

The two failures of the neoclassical explanatory
mechanism reflect on its foundations
in quite different ways. The existence
of unemployment is clearly a direct contradiction
to the notion of the smoothly

clearing market. One must of course be
aware that the official measure of unem-'
ployment is by no means a simple inequality
between supply and demand; it aggregates
a whole range of distinct markets,
it does not separate out voluntary and involuntary
unemployment according to the

tests of economic theory, and it does not
take account of unfilled jobs. I do not subscribe,
I hasten to say, to the sometimes
expressed view that all unemployment is
essentially voluntary, an unwillingness to
search or whatnot; indeed, the official
measure may underestimate the degree of
disequilibrium in the labor market, particularly
with regard both to underutilization
of advanced skills and discouraged job
seekers. With all these qualifications, it is
clear that statistical unemployment does
correspond to a disequilibrium as that
term is used in the basic neoclassical
model; there are two individuals, identical
in productive capacity and both willing
to work at a given wage, but one is working
at that wage and the other is not.
Differential levels of economic development,
on the other hand, point to a difficulty
with the other fundamental concept;
the conditions of optimization. If countries
differ in their production possibility sets,
then firms, occupying similar economic
positions, are facing different constraints
on their optimization. This does not contradict
the fundamental assumption of

optimizing behavior, but it does raise
severe questions about its interpretation.
The simplest hypothesis is to take the
technological conditions as data, possibly
varying over time due to exogenous changes
in scientific knowledge. But here we are
asserting that two contemporaries have
different access to productive knowledge.
Clearly, we are saying something about the
conditions of transmission of knowledge
across national boundaries, and of course
the same questions arise among firms or
workers within a single economy. The constraints
upon the firm's optimization begin
to seem more like variables to be explained
than like constants exogenously given.
Let me look now at the two basic concepts
from the inside, from the point of
view of our direct perceptions which motivate
the modelling. The two are far from
parallel. The optimization by individual
agents has a sense of concreteness about it,
for all the sophisticated mathematical
ability with which we theorists endow the
agents. They behave in ways whose logic
we understand. They seek to achieve goals
which are reasonable to postulate, and we
can specify constraints which clearly are
real. It can be and has been correctly objected
that our models are too simple; we
ignore other arguments in the utility function,
power, status, social approval, or
whatnot that also motivate individuals,
and we ignore some constraints, capacity
for calculation and social controls. But the
model is comprehensible, and the motives
and constraints we deal with are real and
important.

The market, on the other hand, is a
much more ethereal construct. Who exactly
is it that is achieving the balancing of
supply and demand? Where in fact is the
information on bids and offers needed for
equilibration actually collected and stored?
Right from the beginning of neoclassical
theory, the difficulty of explaining markets
in terms of individual self-seeking behavior
was perceived. Parenthetically, this
is one example of the superiority of neoclassical
analysis to its predecessors, despite


### ---Economics-1974-0-06.txt---
the current fashion for exalting
Ricardo over his successors; Ricardo implicitly
equated supply and demand on all
his markets without ever realizing the
problematic nature of this process. Jevons
felt obliged to enunciate explicitly a Law
of Indifference, enforced by arbitrage; but
this does not really meet the problem when
the market is out of equilibrium, for the
arbitrage might well not be feasible.
Menger, at least according to Hayek and
Streissler, concentrated on individual trades
and ignored the market completely. It is
Walras's auctioneer which has proved to
have had the most enduring effect on subsequent
theoretical development, and the
stability theory which flows from that concept
is still the subject of vigorous theoretical
development, though very little
empirical application. What is envisioned
is a feedback mechanism in which errors
in the price are successively corrected by
reference to the disequilibria they generate.
This view specifies and makes feasible
the operations of the market. But on one
hand the stability models are far from
adequate representations even of the dynamics
of the neoclassical models and,
what may be connected, the results are by
no means necessarily favorable to the
stability of the adjustment process; and on
the other hand, the motivations for the
feedback to operate are obscure.
Let me be clear on one methodological
point. The fact that our intuitive understanding,
our verstehen as the German

social methodologists call it, of the market
as an institution is not entirely satisfactory
does not mean that we should not use the
perfect market as a model, at least pending
further development. Certainly, as Popper
and Friedman hold, the acceptability of a
theory is to be judged by its ability to
predict and understand phenomena. The
theory of the perfect market is in an interesting
way complementary to Keynesian
theory. We have never been able to
integrate Keynesian viewpoints into standard
neoclassical theory, in terms of individual
motivation, yet this theory, with
its various modifications, has been a most
serviceable tool of prediction and control.
In fact, it is useful in domains where competitive
theory fails and vice versa. Neither
theory is good, however, at predicting dynamic
processes, the short-run changes
which are responses to disequilibria, and it
is here that the pressure for a more satisfactory
model arises.

Hold in abeyance for a moment our considerations
about the market. Let us return
to the optimization problem of the individual.
One aspect on which we put a

good deal of weight, particularly in our less
formal discussions, is that a market system
is informationally economical. That is, we
tend to regard it as a virtue of the system
that the individual agent need not know
very much. Specifically, he is supposed to
know the motivation and production conditions
which define him, i.e., his utility
function and production possibility set,
together with the prices of the commodities
he buys and sells. The economic system,
taken as a whole, has vastly more in it
than any one individual knows; it contains
the utility functions and production possibilities
of all individual agents. Indeed,
the apparent modesty of the information
needed is one of the most appealing aspects
of the neoclassical model, both in the
descriptive sense that the individual's decision
problems appear manageable for him
and for the economist studying him, and
in the normative sense that the system
permits its members to spend their time
and effort at producing goods rather than
in unnecessary duplication of information.
But clearly this simplification of the individual'
s decision making is made possible
only because the markets have supplied
the information economized on, in the form
of prices. In equilibrium, at least, the system
as a whole gives the impression of


### ---Economics-1974-0-07.txt---
great economy in the handling of information,
presumably because transmission of
prices is in some significant sense much
cheaper than transmission of the whole set
of production possibilities and utility
functions. It is this point which emerged
in the great debate over the feasibility of
socialism begun by Ludwig von iMises's
attack and usually thought of as concluding
with the work of Oskar Lange and
Abba Lerner in the 1930's; though it should
be added many of the essential points had
already been made earlier by Vilf redo
Pareto and Enrico Barone. XVhat was argued,
in effect, was that a socialist system
could use the price system and therefore
achieve whatever economies in information
it does achieve; and if the equilibrium
conditions are written out they do give the
appearance of relative simplicity. But
what was left obscure is a more definite
measure of information and its costs, in
terms of which it would be possible to assert
the superiority of the price system
over a centralized alternative. Though I
feel that current work has brought about a
considerable clarification, we still have no
definite measure. Indeed, in some respects,
more recent developments have made the
answers less clear. Several writers, in both
Western and socialist countries, have noted
that alternative decentralized schemes
exist where quantity messages rather than
price messages are transmitted in the successive
stages of approximation and that
such schemes also have efficient equilibrium
points. Indeed, with the development of
mathematical programming and highspeed
computers, the centralized alternative
no longer appears preposterous. After
all, it would appear that one could mimic
the workings of a decentralized system by
an appropriately chosen centralized algorithm.
While there is more to the story
than these few remarks, they do make the
point that if we are going to take informational
economy seriously, we have to add
to our usual economic calculations an appropriate
measure of the costs of information
gathering and transmission.

But actually the comparisons between
socialist and capitalist resource allocation
systems have tended to overlook some of
the most obvious facts while examining
finer points closely. As we all know, both
production and consumption (lecisions are
in fact made with reference to the future
as well as to the present. A rational production
plan includes very importantly decisions
or at least plans about the future; and
similarlv with consumption plans. Investment
and savings are not only integral
parts of our current decisions but in the
long run shape the possibilities for further
development. As we know, the formal neoclassical
model can be extenided to decisions
over time by dating commodities and
regarding the same commodity at different
dates as different commodities. All previous
conclusions follow; allocative efficiency,
for example, is achieved with the
same appearance of informational efliciency.
But of course there is a slight problem
with this reasoning. The information
about future commodities needed includes
their prices. These prices must be those
found on a suitable market, one in which
future supply and future demand are
equated. Unfortunately, no such markets
exist. Even the futures markets in certain
commodities, limited in extent as they are,
do not in fact lead to balancing all future
decisions. Rather they balance present
commitments to the future; but it is understood
by all parties that when the future
becomes the present, there will be a
spot market on which the futures commitments
may be undone; and indeed those
making no futures commitments at all can
enter and know now that they will be able
to enter.

Even as a graduate student, I was somewhat
surprised at the emphasis on static
allocative efficiency by market socialists,


### ---Economics-1974-0-08.txt---
when the nonexistence of markets for future
goods under capitalism seemed to me
a much more obvious target.

However that may be, the nonexistence
of these markets must be faced. Now in
general equilibrium any part of the system
affects every other part in at least two
different ways. Thus, we may ask two
questions about the nonexistence of futures
goods markets: what are its implications
for the rest of the system and what are the
reasons for its nonexistence.

The implication first of all is that the
information needed by the optimizer is not
provided by an existing market. It will be
provided by a market which will exist in
the future, but that is a bit too late to help
in decisions made today. Hence, the optimizer
must replace the market commitment
to buy or sell at given terms by
expectations: expectations of prices and
expectations of quantities to be bought or
sold. But he cannot know the future.
Hence, unless he deludes himself, he must
know that both sets of expectations may
be wrong. In short, the absence of the
market implies that the optimizer faces a
world of uncertainty.

The exact modelling of behavior under
uncertainty is probably not crucial to the
subsequent discussion; let us use the
conventional expected-utility hypothesis.
When there is uncertainty, risk aversion
implies that steps will be taken to reduce
risks. This partly affects decisions within
the firm, such as the holding of inventories
and preference for flexible capital equipment,
and partly leads to new markets
which will shift risks to those most able
and willing to bear them, particularly
through the equity market. The rich development
of inventory theory and portfolio
theory in the last twenty years or so
reflects growing understanding of these
matters.

But when we speak of expected utilities,
we need to have some probabilities. Where
do these come from? We may in the first
instance regard them as subjective. But
the economic agent observes his world and
has the opportunity to learn from his experience,
for there is a considerable degree
of continuity. By Bayes' Theorem or perhaps
psychological learning theory, the
probabilities, say of future prices, will
gradually adjust so as to conform to the
facts. If indeed the econromic world exhibited
the same structure in some sense
from period to period, and if everybody
observed everything relevant, then the
probabilities ascribed by different individuals
to the same events might be expected
gradually to converge to the correct values
and therefore be the same for all. In fact,
of course, the basic economic facts are
changing, partly endogenously because of
capital accumulation in its most general
sense, partly exogenously with predictable
and unpredictable changes in technology
and tastes; equally if not more important,
though, is the fact that the dispersion of
information which is so economical implies
that different economic agents do not have
access to the same observations. Hence, it
is reasonable to infer that they will never
come into agreement as to probabilities of
future prices.

A further implication is that the past influences
the future. Jevons's well-known
slogan, "bygones are forever bygones,"
ceases to be fully accurate. The past is relevant
because it contains information
which changes the image of the future; the
probabilities which govern future actions
are modified by observations on the past.
It follows that present decisions with implications
for the future are functions of
past values of variables as well as present
values.

This point of view has been exploited in
the econometric models which have used
distributed lags in explaining investment
decisions. What still needs to be exploited
more, however, is that the inference to the


### ---Economics-1974-0-09.txt---
future is necessarily uncertain, and the
decisions made still exhibit risk aversion.
Expectations for the future are related
to quantities as well as prices. The importance
of quantity expectations has been
stressed in macroeconomic models, even in
such pre-Keynesian concepts as the acceleration
principle, and most especially in
relation to inventories. It sometimes is
held that in a neoclassical world only prices
matter; in the absence of prices, presumably
they are replaced by price expectations.
But that is not strictly true. Under
constant returns, at least, quantity information
for the individual firm is needed
even when neoclassical assumptions are
strictly fulfilled. Neoclassically founded investment
theories usually predict capitaloutput
ratios or capital-labor ratios; they
still need output forecasts explicitly or implicitly.
This gives considerable, perhaps
major weight to past quantity information
in predicting the future and therefore in
guiding current investment decisions. It is
perhaps along these lines that Keynesian
theory, with its overwhelming emphasis on
quantity changes as equilibrating variables,
can be founded firmly on individual
optimizing behavior.

I have referred to the fact that information
is dispersed throughout the economy
but have not suggested how. In the pure
neoclassical model, each agent knows only
his own production possibilities and his
tastes, together with market information
on the rest of the economy. In the world I
have just sketched, however, any variables
which improve his ability to predict the
future have a very meaningful economic
value to him. He will seek to acquire additional
information. Such information is
presumably costly; that is the basis for
such great emphasis on the value of informational
economy. But there is clearly

a great incentive to acquire information of
predictive value, and, as neoclassical
theory would predict, there will be an incentive
to produce such information. We
have then an economic information industry:
(lata assembly and analysis, business
journalism, economic forecasting, with
a longer-run perspective business education.
Since information as a commodity
does not satisfy all the neoclassical norms,
it is not surprising that the government
plays a large role in this process. Information-
acquisition activities and information
markets now appear on the economic landscape.
Efficiency in the operation of firms
ceases to be purely productive efficiency;
it involves efficiency in prediction as well.
I would conjecture that the incomplete
diffusion of information -along the lines just
sketched has a good deal to do with the
operations of the securities markets and
the decisions on corporate financing. The
predominant role of internal financing and
indeed the whole special importance of the
managerial factor in corporate decision
making are clearly connected with differential
access to information about the
firm.

You may have forgotten by now, but I
earlier promised to consider not only the
implications of but also the causes for the
absence of markets for future goods. One
might wonder why one should explain the
absence of a phenomenon. Sherlock Holmes
once maintained to the dimwitted local
police inspector so typical of English detective
stories that the significant question
in the case at hand was the dog's barking
at night. "But," said the inspector, "the
dog didn't bark." "That," said Holmes,
"is what is significant." So too is the absence
of these markets significant for a full
neoclassical theory. A truncated theory of
temporary equilibrium in which markets
for future goods are replaced by some form
of expectations, themselves functions of
current prices and quantities, has indeed
been developed, though its empirical content
is necessarily meager if the formation
of expectations is left unanalyzed. But the


### ---Economics-1974-0-10.txt---
true neoclassical spirit is being denied in
such a model. Although we are not usually
explicit about it, we really postulate that
when a market could be created, it will be.
I sometimes think that welfare economics
ought to be considered an empirical discipline.
Implicitly, if an opportunity for a
Pareto improvement exists, then there will
be an effort to achieve it though some social
device or another. In our theories and
to a considerable extent in practice, the
cheapest way in many cases is the creation
of a market; and markets do emerge. If a
market is impractical for one or another of
the reasons we usually call "market failure,
" then very likely some other social
device will at least be tried: government
intervention; codes of professional ethics;
or economic organizations with some
power intermediate between the competitive
firm and the government.

Thus, the failure of markets for future
goods must be regarded as an analytic
problem as well as a presupposition. It
seems to me there are two basic causal factors.
One is that contracts are not enforceable
without cost and forward contracts
are more costly to enforce than contemporaneous
contracts; the other is that because
of the many uncertainties about the
future, neither buyers nor sellers are willing
to make commitments which completely
define their future actions. Let me
take these two points up in turn.
The ability to make enforceable contracts
is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for a market. However, there is
no way to insure complete enforceability.
An individual may make a contract which
he cannot in fact fulfill. Penalties may indeed
be imposed on failure to live up to
one's agreement, but they are not a substitute
for compliance from the viewpoint
of the other party, and there is always a
degree of cost in enforcing the penalties.
The laws of bankruptcy are a social recognition
that complete enforceability is impossible
and that it is even socially desirable
to set limits on the penalties for
failure. However, when the exchange of
values for values is simultaneous or nearly
so, the contracts may almost be selfenforcing.
If a good has been sold and not
paid for, it can be recovered; if there is a
continuing relation of buyer and seller, a
failure to settle bills can be met by refusal
to make further deliveries, in which case
the loss is minimized. With contracts extending
into the distant future, on the
contrary, the possibility of failure to comply
becomes greater, partly because the
self-enforcement aspects become weaker,
partly because unexpected changes may
intervene to make even a sincerely intended
compliance difficult or impossible.
The outstanding examples of forward
contracts are credit instruments. The
buyer, who is taking the risks of default, is
motivated to protect himself by seeking
more information about the seller. The
lender wants to know the borrower's assets,
the prospects for changes in them,
possibly even what he is going to do with
the money. This very individualized information-
seeking relation is quite far

from the arm's length impersonal model of
a market. The so-called capital markets
are in many structural aspects very different
from our model markets. It is of
course an empirical question how far their
behavior departs from the model. But
the recurrent theme of credit rationing and
availability doctrines, the essential imperfections
of the credit market which underlie
monetarist theories of cyclical fluctuations
suggest that the incomplete enforceability
of credit contracts and the

protective steps taken by lenders are significant
factors in explaining the working
of the market.

While the enforceability question explains
why those forward contacts that are
made do not constitute a perfect market,
we need more to understand why even


### ---Economics-1974-0-11.txt---
these are so limited in their coverage of
future goods transactions. There are forward
contracts in money, some commodities,
real estate, but very little else.
The explanation lies in uncertainties of
both buyers and sellers about prices and
quantities and about technology and
tastes. Using uncertainties about prices
and quantities as an explanation for market
failure is a circular argument, though
not necessarily a fallacy. That is, if all
markets for future goods existed and
cleared all transactions, then there would
be no price-quantity uncertainties. But
this much is true; if some markets for future
goods do not exist, then the agents
have uncertainties which are relevant to
their behavior on markets for complementary
or substitute goods. As Hicks showed
a long time ago, complementarity and substitution
can occur over time as well as
simultaneously. If, as I will argue in a
minute, uncertainty can tend to destroy
markets, then we can conclude that the
absence of some markets for future goods
may cause others to fail.

To illustrate, the demand for capital
goods at any point of time is dependent on
the prices and sales of the product at future
points of time. Therefore the demand
for future capital goods will depend on expectations
about the product at some still
more removed time. If we assume only
that we will not have markets for products
at some distant point of time, then the
resulting uncertainty will reflect itself in a
failure of the market for capital goods in
the nearer future, which will in turn create
still further uncertainties.

Thus, if some markets for future goods
are nonexistent, there will be uncertainties
on the other markets; in addition, demand
and supply conditions for the future are
uncertain because of technological and
taste shifts. Assume that both buyers and
sellers are risk averters. Then without
going into details it is reasonable to conclude
that both demand and supply will
have a downward bias as compared with
the situation in which uncertainty is absent.
A buyer will be unwilling to contract
for purchase of a good if a superior or
cheaper substitute may be available; and
the seller will be unwilling to accept a
price sufficiently low to be suitable to the
buyer, particularly if he thereby precludes
himself from a possible opportunity to
shift his resources to other closely related
goods. It would seem possible, at least,
that there will be no price at which transactions
in future goods will take place.
From a theoretical viewpoint, one might
say that the market is in a strange sort of
equilibrium; there is some shadowy sort of
price at which supply and demand are
equated at zero. But this price is not performing
much of a signalling function.
There is one ultra-neoclassical approach
to the market treatment of uncertainties,
in which I take some pride. That is the notion
of a contingent market. Instead of
letting uncertainty ruin existing markets,
we can take it explicitly into account by
buying and selling commitments to be
carried out only if some uncertain event
occurs. We could in principle imagine
agreements to transact which will hold if
and only a given conceivable technological
innovation does not take place, with a
second market for transactions valid if the
innovation does take place. Then we can
restore the possibility of markets.
Such contingent markets are not entirely
unknown; insurance contracts are
the purest example, and equity markets
and cost-plus contracts provide more
muddied illustrations. But they are relatively
rare. Why this should be so follows
again from the general problem of informatioin
costs and dispersal. If contracts are
contingent on the occurrence of some
event, then it must be verified whether or
not the event occurre(l. But this is information,
an(I as the example of a technological


### ---Economics-1974-0-12.txt---
innovation suggests, it is information
likely to be much more easily available to
one party than to the other. Hence, the
range of possible contingent contracts becomes
limited to those for whom the events
are easily verifiable for both parties. The
implications of these limits are known in
the insurance literature as adverse selection
and moral hazard, and they are of
immediate practical significance in such
matters as health insurance. But more
broadly, they so limit the scope of contingent
markets in practice that, as argued
before in connection with markets for future
goods, they prevent the emergence of
even technically possible markets because
of the large unresolved uncertainties.
I hope enough has been said to indicate
the widespread implications of costly, dispersed
information for the process by
which future-oriented economic decisions
are made. Let me remark, briefly in view
of the length of time I have already taken,
that informational costs and values play a
key role in modifying the structure even of
contemporaneous transactions. The individual
optimizing agent is supposed to
know at least his technology or tastes and
the prices he faces. We have already argued
a good deal of uncertainty with respect
to the future economic implications
of present economic choices. But in addition
there is the possibility that technological
information, which would be useful
to him, exists somewhere in the world but
outside his firm. There are grounds for
engaging in the active pursuit of information.
We begin to enter the realm of diffusion
of innovations, to which some sociologists
as well as economists have contributed.
The interesting points here are
the biasses in the information channels,
some of which, at least, can be explained
in terms of differential costs of acquiring
information. For example, the well-documented
role of personal influence in accepting
innovations can be interpreted as
due to a perceived high reliability of such
information; in economic terms, this means
more information per unit of expenditure
of time or money.

The terms of trade with the outside
world should not be regarded as freely
given to the firm. In a world with a large
number of commodities, even knowing the
prices of relevant commodities involves
the costly acquisition of certain kinds of
information. This remark has given rise
to a large literature on search in recent
years. One implication which has been
only slightly explored is that the concept
of the market begins to weaken, and
Jevons's Law of Indifference becomes
more of an equilibrium condition than a
statement valid about a market even in
disequilibrium. At a moment of time,
prices of what would usually be thought of
as the same commodity bought or sold by
different firms can differ because buyers or
sellers may not, in their ignorance and in
the presence of costs of search, find it
worthwhile to shop further. Obviously, the
important application of this principle
may be to the labor market. Clearly, there
are important informational differences
between the employees currently working
for a firm and potential substitutes elsewhere,
although these are interchangeable
in pure neoclassical theory. Indeed, there
are differences both in the information the
firm possesses about its employees as compared
with alternatives and the information
which employees have about the economic
opportunities and the specific production
conditions of the firm as compared
with outsiders. It appears that considerations
of this type must play some role in
understanding the continued possibility of
unemployment and particularly the sluggish
response of wages to market disequilibria.


I am far from exhausting the implications
of an information-economical viewpoint
for the economic world. I look forward
to exciting developments in the next
decade.
 ## Economics-1975-0


### ---Economics-1975-0-01.txt---
I come here with no eye-opening report
from the frontiers of economics, no stirring
cry for reform of conventional economics,
no closely reasoned analysis of an economic
dilemma or puzzle, no scathing or
reproachful scolding of the profession for
its technical preciousness or moral blindness,
no report on painstaking research
results, no valedictory on a lifetime of
theoretical or empirical contributions. The
AEA presidential addresses have been all
of these things.

But tonight, going against our current
fashion of telling the world what's wrong
with economics, I offer a modest contribution
to the immodest subject of what's
right with economics-and, in particular,
what's right with economics as a guide to
public policy. In doing so, I won't ignore
the dark side of the moon-indeed, I can't,
since I will deal at some length with the bedeviling
subject of inflation. But believing
that it is at least as reasonable to judge a
discipline by its successes as by its failures,
I intend to accentuate the positive.
I. The Critical Look Inward

In recent years, as I shall illustrate in a
moment, we have instead accentuated the
negative. In good part, this has taken the
becoming form of mea culpa or rather
nostra culpa. We have, for example, readily
confessed that the inflationary shocks of
1973-74 caught not just the economy but
the economist by surprise. On this and
other fronts, the chorus of self-criticism
has risen to a new crescendo. It is almost
as if we take pride in our humility. Nietzsche
must have been thinking of economists
when he observed that "he who

despises himself nevertheless esteems himself
as a self-despiser."

This is not to imply that economists'
criticisms are all self-inflicted wounds. Far
from it. Often among our colleagues'
favorite targets are the shortcomings of
mainstream economics, the misuse of
modern techniques, the fallacies of conventional
wisdom-in each case, the target
is not the critic's but his colleagues' brand
of economics, not mea culpa but eorum
culpa.

In any event, he who comes to praise
economics risks being buried in the barrage
of indictments that economists have
brought against themselves and their
brethren. Let me give you a sampling of
some that will be ringing in my ears as I
follow the parlous path of economic virtue.
Ceremonial occasions-presidential, memorial,
or inaugural addresses-in particular
seem to evoke musings on the

troubled or even dismal state of our science.
For the AEA faithful, I need only
recall John Kenneth Galbraith condemning
neoclassical and neo-Keynesian economics
for ignoring power and thus losing
contact with the real world; Wassily
Leontief attacking mathematical economics
for building a showy superstructure
on weak empirical foundations and
unverified assumptions, and thus losing
contact with the real world; Kenneth


### ---Economics-1975-0-04.txt---
Boulding assailing welfare economics for
its reliance on that holiest of holies, Pareto
optimality-when in fact "our lives are
dominated by precisely this inter-dependence
of utility functions which the Paretian
optimum denies"-thus also losing
contact with the real world.

In one form or another, variations on
Leontief's lament have been heard in many
another presidential address, to wit:
By F. H. Hahn (Econometric Society,
1968), who decried "the spectacle of so
many people refining the analysis of
economic states which they give no
reason to suppose will ever, or have
ever, come about...."

By G. D. N. Worswick (Section F of
the British Association, 1971), who
viewed the performance of economics
as "curiously disappointing," suggesting
that it has "a marvelous array of pretend
tools which would perform wonders
if ever a set of facts should turn up in
the right form."

By E. H. Phelps Brown (Royal Economics
Society, 1971), who judged the
usefulness of current work in economics
as ''not equal to its distinction" because
it is "built upon assumptions about human
behavior that are plucked from
the air."

By James H. Blackman (Southern
Economic Association, 1971), who noted
that models with sufficiently intriguing
mathematical properties can achieve
lives of their own even if they lead the
investigator further away from reality
and yet, "the profession's incentive
system tends perversely to reward this
kind of endeavor and to deflect the
attention of gifted economists from the
exploration of concrete problems and
the dirty work that entails."

By Sherman Maisel (American Finance
Association, 1973), who concluded
that most of the literature of
monetary economics is "non-operational"
since its prescriptions are too often
based on limited or false assumptions,
it by-passes critical operational problems,
and it ascribes too great validity
to its statistical tests.

By Barbara Bergmann (Eastern Economic
Association, 1974), who prefaced
her plea for more microsimulation to
incorporate "realistically messy information"
in our economic data base with
a few roundhouse swings at the economics
profession and the pointed observation
that instead of studying the

real nature of decision making, we
typically rush to make assumptions
"whose purpose in life is to let the
theorem emerge, all neat and provable."
Another favorite line of criticism and
attack focusses on the implicit value
premises of conventional economics. Gunnar
Myrdal and Robert Heilbroner chide
us for concealing the value judgments that
inevitably enter into our selection of problems
for study, choice of approach, definition
of concepts, and even gathering of
data. So a "value-free" economics is an
illusion-they urge economists to specify
their values and thus avoid biases and
make research more realistic.

Radical economists simply reject the
whole value system of conventional economics-
as they see it, the neoclassical
paradigm in its very bone and marrow
enthrones acquisitiveness and enshrines
the existing order. Paul Sweezy accuses
mainstream economists "of hiding the
facts, of making the uncontrollable appear
under control, of rationalizing a system
which condemns hundreds of millions of
people to lives of despair and starvation.
... "


### ---Economics-1975-0-05.txt---
Inflation is the latest source of critical
volleys, and I will get to these in due
course. Meanwhile, the sampler of economic
masochism I have already provided
should serve as ample insurance against
complacency or smugness in considering
"what's right with economics." At the
same time, it strongly suggests that economics,
more than any other social science,
is afflicted with the common scold.
1 recognize that such a quick sampling
and cryptic quotes, selected to highlight
criticism, do a certain injustice to economics
and to some of the quoted economists
whose kindlier observations have
been neglected in the process. But I am
also aware that my litany omitted a number
of familiar flaws, for example, our
impounding of tastes and preferences in
ceteris paribus; the shortcomings of the
maximization principle in explaining consumer
and producer behavior, especially in
the short run; and our limited ability to
bring the claims of future generations into
our social utility functions.

Were I to serve as defense counsel for the
profession on this wide variety of indictments,
I would urge that we plead guilty
or take the Fifth on some, take to the defense
on others, and take offense at the
rest. Having paid my respects to the critics,
I intend no point-by-point evaluation or
rebuttal. This has been ably undertaken
by others.' Rather, my object is to gain a
more balanced perspective by focussing on
the quality, role, and contributions of
economics, especially to public policy. In
that undertaking, the first step is to examine
the flank we expose to the public.
II. The Economist and the Public
When we turn from inside to outside
critics, the focus changes. We may think,
rightly, that freely confessing our weaknesses
and airing our differences stimulate
responses and adaptations that strengthen
economics. Yet, wearing our purple hearts
on our sleeves has its price. It nourishes
the darkest suspicions about our art and
supplies live ammunition to outside critics
who have declared open season on economists.
Witness the open sesame to the edop
pages for such recent thrusts as B ergmann'
s assault on economists in general
and Friedrich von Hayek's attack on
Keynesians in particular. With everything
from off-the-cuff phrases about being
"caught with our parameters down" to
tracts for the Times, we feed the hand that
bites us.

This is not a plea to do our self-flagellating
in secret or to mute our disputes
and conflicts. Open controversies, openly
arrived at, are part of the therapy that
keeps our profession healthy. Rather, my
plea is to the media and the opinion makers
to understand that appearances are deceiving,
that hard give-and-take is indeed
a symbol of strength, and that our areas
of agreement and consensus are vastly
larger than our areas of difference.
On the first point, observers from other
disciplines are of ten astonished at how
hard economists go at each other, how
readily they run the gauntlet of their colleagues'
criticisms with no quarter asked
and none given-and, with few exceptions,
all this within the framework of professional
respect and friendship. As Charles
Frankel put it, unlike other social sciences,
economics seems to have achieved
"a working etiquette which allows people
to disagree vigorously without engaging
in recrimination about 'unscientific' or
'unprofessional' behavior" (quoted in
Johnson (1973)).

What accounts for this? Part of it, one
can unblushingly say, is simply that so
many competent, tough, and rigorously
I Among those who have sprung to the defense with
varying degrees of fervor are Harry Johnson (1968),
Donald MacDougall, Charles Schultze (1972), Robert
Solow (1970, 1971), and James Tobin (1973, 1974). For
more general appraisals of the criticisms and the state
of economics, see Blackman and Nancy Ruggles.


### ---Economics-1975-0-06.txt---
trained minds have been drawn into economics
in response not just to challenging
policy problems but to the quantitative
revolution since World War II. And part
of it is that the participants can draw on a
hard core of economic theory and methodology,
together with a growing body of
empirical knowledge, to provide standards
for testing the validity (though not necessarily
the relevance and reality) of ideas,
analysis, and empirical findings. The result
is not only a relentless intellectual
policing of the profession that soon exposes
the fool, the quack, and the charlatan, but
a growing capacity "to participate in adversary
debate over public policy issues
without jeopardizing scientific integrity
and freedom" (Johnson (1973)).
That brings me to the second point, the
impression we give outsiders of a house
divided, not to say splintered. It is worth
reminding ourselves and our critics of
several factors that drive a wedge between
image and reality.

One, instead of laying aside our differences
and living contentedly together, we
economists tend to lay aside our agreements
and live contentiously together. We
focus our private and public debates on
unsolved policy problems, tough analytical
nuts, and issues on which we have rival
theories, contradictory evidence, or strong
ideological differences. Just as these are
the questions that intrigue us, they are
the ones that attract the attention of press
and public. What we know-and they may
not is that beneath the visible tip of disagreement
and rivalry lies no huge iceberg
of divisiveness.

Two, it is only occasionally that our
areas of consensus are brought to the surface
in a newsworthy way. One such occasion
was the White House "summit conference"
on inflation last September. Two
dozen leading economists from across a
wide spectrum of American economics
(not wide enough, the radicals would say)
signed a statement which called on the
President and Congress to eliminate
twenty-two restrictive laws and practices
that inhibit competition, inflate costs, and
prop up prices. Only a tiny minority held
out (if any minority that includes Galbraith
can be called "tiny"). Even more
striking, in a sense, was that while the
customary and largely ideological clashes
among, say, Galbraith, Milton Friedman,
and Paul Samuelson caught the public
eye, the real story lay in the minimal dissent
among the participants on (a) the
forecast of a soggy or sagging economy,
(b) the urgency of providing relief to the
victims of inflation and the casualties of
recession, (c) the need to ease monetary
restraint, (d) the small anti-inflationary
payoff on moderate ($5 to $10 billion)
budget cuts, and (e) the advisability of
resisting popular demands for reimposing
full-scale wage and price controls.
Three, even where disagreement flourishes
most visibly, perhaps, between
Keynesians and monetarists-the public
may not discern that the analytical and
empirical ties that bind us are far stronger
than the forces that divide us. Our controversies
take place within the context of
basic consensus on the nature and methods
of economic theory and inquiry, on the
content of the disagreement, and on the
kinds of tests that may one day resolve the
conflict. "Such disagreement within agreement
lies at the heart of the process of
normal development of a science" (Benjamin
Ward, p. 12).

Four, much of what the public perceives
as a clash of economic concepts and findings
is in fact a clash of ideology and
values. Given the way technical economics
and ethical preferences are packaged in
policy debates (and given our lapses in
identifying which is which), this is hardly
surprising. Thus, whoever opens the package
labeled "monetarist" typically finds
not just money supply in full flower, but a


### ---Economics-1975-0-07.txt---
dedication to minimum government intervention,
small budgets, reliance on rules
rather than authority, and price stability.
Contrasting correlations appear in the
Keynesian package. So outsiders can be
excused for slipping into the fallacy of
association and attributing the split to
our unresolved analytical conflicts rather
than to divergent evaluations of social
priorities and competing philosophies of
government. These associational chains are
not linked together by any inexorable
logic in part, they seem to be an accident
of birth as in the case of the Chicago twins
of monetarism and laissez-faire rules. A
belief in the supremacy of monetary over
fiscal tools could quite logically go hand-inhand
with avid interventionism. But this
escapes the jaundiced eye of the outside
observer, who takes the ideological lineup
as further evidence that economics is
riven to its core.

Five, there is an ironic but substantial
inverse correlation between the degree of
consensus among economists and the degree
of public acceptance of their findings.
Thus, in the macro-economic sphere of stabilization
policy, where debate and disputes
among economists flourish, their imprint
on public policy is undeniable. But in
the considerably more peaceful realm of
microeconomics and allocative. efficiency
-where a reliable analytical apparatus
coupled with solid quantitative work, especially
on costs and benefits, has led the
great majority of disinterested economists
to an agreed diagnosis and prescriptionthe
policy box score shows few hits, fewer
runs, and lots of runners lef t on base.
Economists widely, in some cases almost
uniformly, favor tougher antitrust policy,
freer trade, deregulation of transportation,
pollution taxes in place of most prohibitions,
and tax reform to remove income tax
shelters. They oppose fair trade laws, restrictive
labor and management practices,
distortive zoning laws and building codes,
import quotas, ceilings on interest rates,
maritime subsidies, and pure (or impure)
pork barrel projects.

Granted, the diffuse and inchoate consumer
interest has been no match for
the sharply focussed, articulate, and wellfinanced
efforts of producer groups. But
the economist is beginning to pick up some
allies. Public interest groups are increasingly
giving focus and force to the consumer
and general public interest. And the
march of events is providing some windfalls:
Among the apples that have dropped
in our laps are flexible exchange rates, the
dethroning of agricultural price supports,
inroads on import quotas, and moves to
end percentage depletion. Under the pressure
of virulent inflation, government actions
that erode productivity and boost
costs and prices are being subjected to new
and searching scrutiny. So perhaps, on
these micro-economic issues where economists
sing in reasonably close harmony,
the outside world will no longer quite tune
us out. In macro-economic policy, where
cacaphony prevails, we can be sure that
the world will tune us in.

It may also be useful to draw attention
especially the attention of those who
interpret us to the public-to certain other
misperceptions and roadblocks that thwart
good economics and tend to put economists
in bad repute.

First, much of our economic analysis
and the uncommon sense growing out of it
fly in the face of "common sense," for
example: that budget deficits need not
spell inflation, nor national debt a burden
on our grandchildren; that thriftiness can
be a mixed virtue; that while exploding oil
prices inflate costs, they deflate demand;
that in an overheated economy, greater
taxes can be the lesser evil; and so on.
Behind every false dictate of common
sense lies a primitive and misbegotten
economic theory-and for most of our
pains to correct it, we can expect to get


### ---Economics-1975-0-08.txt---
the back of everyman's hand.

Second, a related cross to bear can be
characterized by Kermit Gordon's apt
phrase, "virtue is so much easier when
duty and self-interest coincide." Not only
does that foredoom action on many microeconomic
fronts, as already noted, but it
puts roadblocks in the path of efforts to
make fiscal policy a two-way street. For
forty years, Congress has enacted major
tax increases only under the whiplash of
war. The resulting reliance on tight money
to fight peacetime excess demand, coupled
with expansionary fiscal policy to fight
recession and slack, have had an unmistakeable
ratchet effect that has tilted the
system toward tighter money and easier
budgets. (Small wonder, by the way, that
many economists and policy makers are
unwilling to give up, via indexing, the
increases in effective income tax rates
"legislated" by inflation.)

Third, the public sees economists as the
bearers of hard and unpalatable truths.
And often we are, by the very nature of
our sometimes dismal discipline. Except
when idle resources can be put to work or
productivity increased, our message is the
stern one of tradeoffs, benefits at a cost,
and no one-dimensional daydreaming.
Even worse, at times economics has to
bring the bad tidings that for some problems
there are no satisfactory solutions.
For some thirty years, we have warned
that full employment, price stability, and
full freedom of economic choice cannot coexist
in a world of strongly organized producer
groups. More recently, economic
analysis has brought home the unromantic
truth that failure to cure some of our social
ills traces less to a failure of will, or "rightwing
villains," or a calloused "establishment,
" or powerlessness of the people,
than it does to the prosaic facts that the
problems are tough and complex and the
goals we seek may be irreconcilable-in
short, trace more to conflicts in our national
objectives than to conflicts among
social groups. Welfare reform is a case in
point: no solution can simultaneously provide
a decent minimum income for all,
preserve work incentives, cut no one's
benefits, and avoid huge budget costs (see
Schultze (1972); Rivlin (1973)). We may
view such work as a contribution to
straight thinking and rational choice. Our
critics are more likely to view it, at worst,
as a counsel of defeat (which it is not) or
at best a counsel of inescapable compromise
(which it is).

Since the foregoing misperceptions and
roadblocks thwart the translation of
good economics into good policy, one could
justify, in cold cost-benefit terms, a sizeable
investment to overcome or reduce
them. The most obvious implication is
that the country needs to invest more in
formal economic education at all levels.
But an equally pressing need is for economists
to invest more of their time and
effort in making themselves understood
to the public and policy maker-and that
in turn requires recognition of this skill
in the academic reward system. This
might serve as a useful antidote to the
influence of mathematics and econometrics
which, while heightening the precision of
professional thinking and internal communication,
have apparently dulled the

appetite and eroded the facility to communicate
with the public in intelligible
English prose.

In a very real sense, this confronts the
press with an unusual opportunity and
challenge, perhaps even a responsibility,
to serve as a translator and interpreter of
economics and its offerings. But believing
(probably rightly) that their readers and
listeners prefer to hear of fights and
failures, crises and controversies, rather
than of quiet contributions and consensus,
the conventional or electronic press is not
very likely to rise to this challenge. So it is
still up to economists. But I must not


### ---Economics-1975-0-09.txt---
carry this too far. Just as I am eschewing
any Cassandra-like pronouncements tonight,
so I have promised myself to suppress
the oracular and even the avuncular
(Dutch-type) mood evoked by these occasions.
So I shall press on.

III. Standards of Judgment

From the foregoing, it is evident that I
feel, first, that economists have gone beyond
beguiling humility and welcome selfcriticism
to the point of almost neurotic
self-rebuke, and second, that press and
public have all too lustily taken up the
cry-in part taking us at our word, in
part misinterpreting us, and in part reflecting
their belief that, after the high
promise of the 1960's, we have failed them
in not foreseeing and forestalling the
crises of the 1970's: stagflation, energy
shortage, and the environment.
In my quest for a more balanced perspective
on the state of economics, the
next task is to set up some standards for
judging the quality and performance of
economists. Since we have developed no
measures of output or allocative efficiency,
no capital-output or cost-benefit ratios, for
the economics "industry," I will have to
fall back on more subjective and less quantitative
measures in judging its quality and
contributions.

My mixed bag of criteria includes (1)
the quality of inputs; (2) the demands for
our services; (3) as a proxy for a measure
of outputs, the record of accomplishment
in a given field (public finance); (4) finally,
the cruelest test, our handling of the economics
of inflation.

The potential of economics for informing
and improving public policy depends on
the stock of human capital, technology
and tools at its command. Here, economics
has no difficulty in holding its head high,
especially in terms of the striking advances
of the past three or four decades.
Harry Johnson may be a trifle extravagant
in his assessment that the United
States now has "perhaps fifty economic
departments of an average quality comparable
to the average quality of the four
or five best departments in the whole
world in the pre-World War II period. . ."
(1973), but only a trifle. Another attest to
professional quality, already referred to,
might be put this way: Show me another
field that has enough inner strength to
confess so much remaining weakness (and
to carry on so much open controversy).
Humility where we have things to be
humble about (and we do) is a becoming
trait. But coupling it with pride where we
have things to be genuinely proud about
is hardly a deadly sin.

Accompanying the growth in the quantity
and quality of economic brainpower
have been striking advances in the techniques
and tools with which economists
work. For this audience, I can speak in
shorthand about the strengthened analytical
base of micro- and macroeconomics;
the methodological revolution that moved
us from the rationalist-historical approach
into the age of quantification, with its
insistence on systematic measurement of
the shapes of economic functions and empirical
testing of hypotheses and its use of
econometrics and simulation techniques
(with a powerful assist from the computer)
; and such conceptual advances as
those in the economics of human capital,
of cost-benefit relations, of uncertainty, of
control, of transactions and information
costs, of "second best," and of the allocation
of time.

In normative economics and the analysis
of value-laden social problems, new frontiers
in the study of economic behavior are
being opened up by survey research techniques
(especially by the Michigan Survey
Research Center), by efforts to measure
nonmarket benefits or values (especially
by the National Bureau of Economic Research)


### ---Economics-1975-0-10.txt---
and by "controlled" social experimentation
(for example, by the Brookings
Institution and the University of Wisconsin
Institute for Research on Poverty).
These newer tools and the institutions
that nurture them constitute part of the
rich and expanding resources of economics.


Economics can also draw on a broad
data base, especially in federal statistics.
But here, the quantity, timeliness, and
even the quality of the data are not keeping
pace with either the problems requiring
analysis or the capacity of our quantitative
techniques. Responding to policy
needs and mounting self-criticism, the
profession has opened many new fronts in
the search for realistic micro-data to link
up with macro-data, for cross-section data
to help overcome the curse of collinearity
in time-series analysis, and for custombuilt
data developed by survey and experimental
techniques.

That the human, analytical, and quantitative
resources of economics provide a
huge potential for solving problems seems
undeniable. That more of these powerful
resources than ever before are being put at
the disposal of economic policy makers
also seems undeniable. What we do not
know is what proportion is being misdirected
into arid puzzles, sterile proofs,
and recreational mathematics while the
world's pressing economic and social problems
go begging for answers. Here, we
can only match one observer's impression
against another's. The profession itself has
not come to grips with this question of
allocative efficiency.

A second test in appraising the state of
economics, one not unknown to economics,
is that of the market place. This takes
several forms, none very robust, but none
trivial. The first is the upsurge in enrollments
in economics courses, especially in
introductory economics, that has occurred
in the academic years 1973-74 and 1974-
75. The second is the oft-reported high
ranking of economists' salaries in business,
government, and academic life. A third
is the strong and growing demand for
economists' inputs into the policy-making
process either as staff members or as
expert witnesses for congressional committees,
individual congressmen, and the
executive branch.

With students, business, and government
beating a path to our door, we can
infer that something must be right with
economics, or wrong with the economy,
or both. Either we are building a better
mousetrap or there are more and bigger
mice threatening our customers. Perhaps
it is simply that we have the only mousetraps
in town.

But there must be more to it than that.
Take the policy maker, for example.
What he finds congenial is that he can
hand an economist a problem relating to
changes in taxation, regulations, budget
proposals, pollution control, poverty, social
security, public service jobs, gasoline
taxes, oil prices, and so on and be reasonably
sure of getting a useful appraisal of
alternative paths to his objectives, of
costs and benefits, and of distributional,
allocative, and stabilization impacts.
Many of these judgments will come with
orders of magnitude or reasonably precise
numbers attached. He may not trust our
GNP forecasts, but he has come to respect
our hardheaded analysis and numbers on
the myriad problems of economic choice
with which he is faced.

It seems fair to draw another inference:
notwithstanding the current wave of selfcriticism
and public criticism, even lampooning,
of economists and despite our

highly visible public debates and highly
vulnerable participation in policy making,
economics continues to maintain its standing
as a science. Signs of a reported crisis
of public confidence or of a "recession of
self-confidence" are few and far between.


### ---Economics-1975-0-11.txt---
Reports of the demise of our discipline are
grossly exaggerated.

IV. The "Outputs" of Public Economics
Having considered some indicators of
the quality of our inputs and of the revealed
preferences for our outputs, let me
continue this exercise in casual (andcongenial)
empiricism by taking an unscientific
but not unrepresentative sample of
the outputs of economics, especially those
bearing on policy. For this purpose, I
draw on my chosen field of public finance,
or public economics, to illustrate the telling
conceptual and empirical advances of
economics in recent decades and the resulting
enrichment of its offerings to the policy
maker. Indeed; such an appraisal offers so
many healthy antidotes to "what's wrong
with economics" that I was tempted to
devote my whole discourse to it tonight.
But I resisted the temptation because,
first, much of it has already been done in
carefully documented depth in survey
volumes by Brookings and the National
Bureau;2 second, I figured it might test
your patience and mine; and third, it
would have left no room for a confrontation
with inflation. So I offer instead a
miniaturized assessment of the achievements
of public economics as viewed

through the policy prism.

Public Expenditures

Consider first the striking contributions
economics has made in the past generation
to clear thinking and better informed
decisions on public expenditures. Partly,
this reflects advances in economic science,
for example, in the theory of public goods
and human capital, and partly, creative
new applications of the economist's characteristic
way of looking at problems of

choice, namely, through the lens of opportunity
costs, benefits, and alternative
paths to a stated goal.

Economics can offer much more concrete
guidance on efficient ways of allocating
resources to achieve stated governmental
objectives than it can on what the
public-private sector division of resources
should be. That may be a good thing in
that presidents and congressmen view the
fixing of goals for public health, housing,
welfare, and the like as what they were
elected for, yet at the same time seek, or
at least accept, economic guidance on the
choice among competing methods of
achieving these goals.

Nonetheless, rapid progress in the
theory of public goods since the appearance
of the Samuelson classic on "The
Pure Theory of Public Expenditures" just
twenty years ago has vastly improved on
the simplistic theory it replaced. It has
facilitated straight thinking on the derivation
of conditions for efficient public-sector
allocations from private evaluations and
on the articulation of social priorities
through the political process.
Interwoven with the newer thinking
about public goods has been a resurgent
interest in externalities or spillover effects.
In a sense, the pure collective good is a
case of total externality-all of its benefits
are external and nonmarketable since
nobody can be excluded from them. That
may clarify thinking but gives little policy
guidance.

Yet, the externality concept translates
into hard-headed policy advice in such
disparate areas as pollution, federal aid,
and the law. When pollution became a
national concern, economists quickly drew
on their tool kit to develop proposals for
antipollution taxes (within the context of
2 See Alan Blinder and Robert Solow et al. This is the
capstone volume of the Brookings Studies on Govern-
ment Finance, directed by Joseph A. Pechman, which
has produced 35 books in the past decade. See also Carl
Shoup et al. This was one of several survey volumes un-
der the general heading, Economic Researchl: Retrospect
and Prospect, based on the Bureau's Fiftieth Anniversary
Colloquia.


### ---Economics-1975-0-12.txt---
target air and water quality standards).
Tax penalties of so much per unit would
put price tags on use of the public's air
and water, thus internalizing external
costs and using market incentives to accomplish
depollution rather than relying
on the less efficient route of regulation.
When local governments supply education
and public health services to a mobile
population, many of the benefits spill over
to other units. An important rationale for
federal grants flows from these externalities,
namely, that to get local units to
produce enough education and health
service to achieve a national, not just a
local, cost-benefit optimum requires conditional
grants from the federal purse.
Further, since externalities in the form
of damage to third parties lies at the heart
of many problems in legal justice, economics
is able to make an important contribution
in this area.

When we turn to the empirical outputs
that are now illuminating problems of
public choice, we find the past decade
bristling with new thinking, new techniques,
and new measurements. These

offer the decision maker important new
guides in the seJection and evaluation of
government programs and new insights
into alternative systems of delivering
government services:

Measurement of cost-benefit ratios
has developed from the early metrics
of water projects into, first, a sophisticated
cost-benefit calculus for tangible
investments like dams, roads, pollutioncontrol
projects and, second, cost-benefit
estimates for intangible investments
in human brainpower, skills, and health.
Shadow pricing has been one of the useful
tools in this connection. Cost-benefit
analysis, even with its limits of quantification
and its inability to shed light
on distributional and value questions,
is an important aid to informed decisions.


A related advance is the development
of new and tougher standards for judging
government programs. The former
criteria centered on the question: Is the
program put into effect quickly and with
high fidelity to the congressional intent?
Now, the accountability question is:
Does it deliver the goods? Does it accomplish
the objectives? Inputs used to
be stressed if they conformed with the
intent of the legislation, they tended to
be judged a success. But now we try to
measure outputs, a tougher and more
elusive standard. (The parallel with
judging the performance of economics
and economists is painfully obvious.)
Antipoverty programs, which were
among the first to be evaluated by these
stringent standards, seem to have borne
the brunt of the evaluation boom. By
the old inputs standard, a program like
Head Start would have fared much
better.

The reach of cost-benefit analysis will
be lengthened if a broad range of new
research efforts in nonmarket sectors of
economic activity pays off. I refer not
only to the exciting work on measurement
of the returns on investments in
human capital (T. W. Schultz), but to
efforts to measure the output of the
medical industry, to measure the relations
between crime and punishment,

and to measure the value of nonmarket
economic activity conducted within
firms and households.

The new technique of controlled social
experimentation on proposed welfare
and housing measures, health insurance,
and education vouchers is yielding important
insights. As a result of experiments
on negative income taxation, for
example, the equity versus efficiency, or
equality versus incentives, controversy
will never be conducted in a vacuum


### ---Economics-1975-0-13.txt---
again (Rivlin (1973)). In spite of some
limitations, the New Jersey experiment
yielded strong evidence that fears of
fatal incentive effects of a negative income
tax were grossly overblown.

Another focus of fruitful thinking relates
to alternative strategies for delivering
social services. The in-cash

versus in-kind choice is a basic one.
Economists are predisposed toward the
in-cash approach on grounds that one
can generally depend on people to follow
their own best interests. But there
are significant exceptions where consumer
sovereignty is limited or specific
goods externalities exist or some explicit
social values take priority.

Out of economics also comes the attempt
to develop "market analogs" to
serve as substitutes for market incentives
in reconciling public with private
interests, decentralized individual decisions
with social goals. Pollution taxes
are a case in point. Performance standards
for teacher pay would be another.
Putting medical insurance programs
on an efficiency-based reimbursement
basis would be a third. The big gap is
in the redesign of incentives and institutions
to guide decentralized government
decision making more systematically
toward the aims of our social

programs (Schultze (1971)). Thus far,
the government, like the economics profession,
is largely in the dark about its
own production function.

Taxation

What strikes an old public finance functionary
as forcibly as any change in the
field of public finance is the way in which
modern thinking has knocked the props
out from under the neat and primitive
theories of tax incidence of a generation
ago. The property tax provides a particularly
instructive case in point. The textbooks
of the 1930's and 1940's told us confidently
that the tax on land (fixed supply)
was capitalized and on dwellings (supplyresponsive)
fell like an excise tax on the
occupant, the consumer of housing services.
The policy lesson was clear: Given
the declining proportion of income spent
on housing services as income rises, the
tax was hopelessly regressive. Today? It is
recognized that the old incidence analysis
was wrong, even on its own terms.
The modern theory of incidence (defined
as the impact on distribution of
private real income) draws on general
equilibrium theory, distinguishes between
sources-of-income and uses-of-income effects,
and disentangles the concepts of
specific, differential, and balanced-budget
incidence. The resulting analysis indicates
that much, of the aggregate burden of the
property tax falls on owners of capital
and hence tends to be progressive and
this progressivity is enhanced by the
particular "excise-type" effects of this
tax (Henry Aaron). In short, error has
been exposed and though the debate is not
over, we are now in transit toward truth.3
It is hard to put down the knee-jerk reaction
that prefixes "property tax" with
"regressive." And it will take some time
before policy makers accept the proposition
that, at the very least, the property
tax is now in the unexpected position of
"innocent until proved guilty." But the
implications for policy are profound.
Economists have long been useful and
influential contributors to the design of the
federal tax structure and of particular
taxes. Again, elementary concepts we now
take for granted-for example, horizontal
versus vertical equity, Richard Musgrave'
s three branches of distribution, al-
3Those who view decisions to locate in a particular
community as a conscious choice of one particular
bundle of public services over others conclude that the
property tax on housing is a benefit tax, a payment for
benefits received.


### ---Economics-1975-0-14.txt---
location, and stabilization, the lagged
effect of tax changes, and automatic versus
discretionary tax changes were not even
part of our vocabulary in the pre-World
War II period. Yet, all of these are now
factored into our economic advice on
taxation.

Even more directly impinging on policy
are the empirical advances. One thinks of
searching studies of particular taxes and
tax components (especially in the Brookings
Studies on Government Finance),
and of the relentless identifying and quantifying
of federal income tax preferences
or "loopholes." Much of the thrust of
economists' recent work on these "tax
expenditures" has been (a) to identify the
beneficiaries and specify the size of the
government subsidies provided in the form
of preferential tax treatment, (b) to define
the inequities, both horizontal and vertical,
that they create, and (c) to estimate
the distortions in resource flows caused by
preferential treatment of oil and gas, housing,
real estate partnerships, and the like,
and measure the resulting welfare loss.
Though the congressional response has
been slow and halting, progress has been
made along the lines plotted by economists,
and a solid base has been laid for
the further tax reform that is surely coming.


Out of the countless other advances,
one stands out, namely, the highly informative
work done on the distributional
impacts of taxation with the aid of the
powerful tool of micro-unit data files (for
example, the MERGE file developed by
Joseph Pechman and Benjamin Okner).
Such micro-unit files are a new-generation
statistical missile, MIRVed so that they
can simultaneously hit multiple revenueestimating
and burden-distribution targets.
With their help, for example, economists
have measured the growing burden
of income, payroll, and consumption taxes
on the lower income groups and developed
techniques for removing them-most recently,
in the context of the impact of
inflation on the same groups.

One should add that if revolution rather
than reform becomes the order of the day
in the federal tax structure, the economist
is ever ready with reasonably sophisticated
analytics and a fair amount of empirical
information on such major alternatives
as a value-added tax, a progressive
expenditure tax, and a net-worth tax. One
of the next stages in tax research, a highly
complex one, will be the general equilibrium
analysis of such sweeping changes
in the tax system as, say, the substitution
of a value-added tax for the corporate
income tax or for part of the payroll tax.
Or, if stimulation of private saving becomes
a compelling objective, perhaps the
substitution of an expenditure tax for
part of the income tax will become a live
issue. The skills of the economist will be
front and center in any such redesign of
the tax system.

The negative income tax story is relevant
here. The concept and its rudimentary
principles were developed and discussed
among economists in the early

1940's. Some of us were already using it as
a teaching device in the mid-1940's. A
quarter-century after its origin, it became
the basis for the Family Assistance Plan
developed by Mr. Nixon's economists.
And a more limited version of the plan
seems again to be rustling in the leaves.
Fiscal Policy

In the domain of fiscal policy, it is harder
to answer the question, "What have
you economists done for us lately?" with
a sparkling array of examples. Much of
the theoretical ferment in this field is associated
with the flowering of Keynesian
macroeconomics in the late 1930's and
1940's, the very period when the microeconomics
of tax incidence and public

expenditures languished.


### ---Economics-1975-0-15.txt---
Conceptual advances have continued
throughout the past twenty-five years, but
they have been more in the nature of a
fleshing out and consolidation of the original
breakthroughs with the aid of the
powerful tools of mathematics and econometrics.
Multiplier analysis, for example,
has moved from the theoretical realm into
large computer models of the economywith
the tax cut of 1964 and the surtax of
1968 providing empirical grist for the mill.
While the models differ on the exact value
of the multiplier, "a fiscal policy planner
will not often be led astray if he uses a
multiplier of 2" for government spending
(see Blinder and Solow).

Coupled with multiplier studies is the
even more subtle study of the structure
of the "outside lags," of the timing of responses
in the economy to changes in

fiscal policy. Though the empirical efforts
and debates go on apace, the behavior of
the cumulative multipliers in a clutch of
economic models suggests that for any
given change in fiscal policy, "at least 75
percent, probably much more, of the ultimate
effect is felt within the first year
after the initiation of the policy" (Blinder
and Solow). Although intractable questions
remain concerning investment responses
to fiscal policy changes, enough
has been learned about aggregate demand
responses to provide two broad generalizations
about fiscal policy:

One, the conditions for intelligent
fiscal policy are met if economic f orecasting
can answer two not-very-exacting
questions: Do projected economic
conditions in the ensuing six to nine
months call for restraint or stimulus?
Is the required dosage large or small?
Two, given the limited margin for
error in a high-employment economy,
it is better to rely on many smaller
monetary-fiscal moves than a few large
ones.

Implicit in these two generalizations is a
third one: Given both the internal shifts
and the external shocks with which stabilization
policy has to cope, a discretionary
policy that makes efficient use of feedback
information will be more effective than
an automatic policy that locks in on fixed
fiscal and monetary targets.

Development of a simplified measure of
fiscal impact revolving around the "full
employment surplus" (FES) concept is
another example of the typical process by
which economists expose error, develop approximations
of truth, but continue the

vigorous debate on further improvements.
First, policy makers had to be weaned
away from the annually balanced budget
and the cyclically balanced budget as
policy targets and from actual deficits or
surpluses (especially in budgets other than
the national income accounts budget) as
measures of budget stimulus or restriction.
It was not easy. It took almost a quarter
of a century before a Democratic president
was converted (in 1961) and another
decade to capture a Republican White
House.

But success on the policy frontier has
its own pitfalls, both political and economic.
What was intended as a measure of
policy was instead taken as a goal, namely,
a balanced budget at full employment,
a "self-fulfilling prophecy" as the Nixon
Administration called it. This erroneously
implied that the fiscal target should remain
fixed regardless of changes in monetary
policy and significant shifts in private
demand, for example, a plant-and-equipment
boom. Apart from trying to correct
such misconceptions, economists have had
to wrestle with the problem of the overstatement
of the full employment surplus
when inflation expands revenues faster
than expenditures, not to mention the
problem of weighting for differing multipliers
if tax or expenditure components
change sharply. In brief, the advances over


### ---Economics-1975-0-16.txt---
the bad old days of the annually balanced
budget are enormous, but economists are
aware of the limitations of the FES measure
and are struggling to resolve them.
Just as economics relegated erroneous
budget concepts to the dustbin, so it has
cast a shadow over such former favorites
(of mine, among others) as federal capital
budgeting and the "shelf of public works."
The initial enthusiasm for the capital
budget concept (in the context of a Congress
seeking to balance the budget annually)
was dispelled by second-thought
analysis showing that (a) it rested on some
faulty parallels with private finance, (b)
the implicit fiscal policy rule of always
financing capital projects by borrowing is
in error, and (c) it would bias government
capital spending toward bricks and mortar
instead of brainpower and people. In the
public works case, the concept ran afoul
the findings of prosaic economic research:
recent studies show that the public works
program launched in 1963 to speed recovery
was far from completed before

excess demand overtook us in the 1966-69
period. This is not to rule out the use of
certain types of "public works" that are
nimble on their feet, such as road and
forest maintenance work, for stabilization
purposes. Nor does it rule out speeding
up or delaying the launching of projects
that are to be undertaken for sound costbenefit
reasons in any event. But it is
fair warning not to expect very much
stabilization help from the public works
sector (not to be confused with public
service employment).

In the conscious use of taxes for stabilization
purposes, the huge 1964 income
tax cut delivered economic expansion and
a balanced budget on schedule without inflation
by mid-1965, just before the Vietnam
escalation struck the economy. The
temporary 1968 surtax, buffeted by powerful
demand forces and monetary easing,
left a more ambiguous econometric trail.
Subsequent fiscal policy thinking emphasizes
the advantages of temporary tax
changes that embody not just income effects
but intertemporal substitution effects.
For example, lowering the prices of investment
goods in a recession via a clearly
temporary increase in the investment
credit, or temporary cuts in consumption
taxes on durable goods (or lacking these,
temporary purchase subsidies), would constitute
a powerful incentive to purchase
those goods before the price went up
again.

Further work is needed to measure the
cost-push effects of anti-inflationary tax
increases that offset part of their demanddamping
effect. In recession, the costeasing
and demand-push effects work in
happy harmony. They work at cross purposes
in tax increases (though not in
expenditure cuts) to curb inflation. The
question of how large the offsetting costpush
effects, or aggregate supply effects,
may be, is unresolved. In a high-inflation
economy, this is a serious gap in our fiscal
policy knowledge.

Other Aspects

This kaleidoscope of contributions, long
as it is, leaves out a whole string of developments
in budget concepts, techniques,
and processes-efforts that were
crowned by the congressional budget reforms
recently put into effect. Much of the
guidance and momentum for these reforms
was provided by economic analysis and by
a succession of five economist-budget directors
throughout the 1960's. Also omitted is
the conceptual work on the economics of
the bureaucratic process, of how government
works. Other omissions include the
rebirth of interest and great advances in
the economics of state-local finance, the
rapid growth of the important new field of
urban economics-with its contributions
to regional economics, location research,
and analysis of the city as an economic system


### ---Economics-1975-0-17.txt---
and the enriched economics of fiscal
federalism. I have even eschewed an assessment
of revenue sharing, the rationale
and form of which were developed by
economists. With little imperialism, economists
can also cite the firm quantitative
evidence being developed to demonstrate
the adverse economic effects of many public
regulatory activities.4

For all the advances, the agenda of unresolved
conceptual questions and unfinished
empirical business is huge. But
even this truncated review of progress
and current output in public economics
makes clear that the contributions of
recent decades have enormously enriched
this field not only conceptually but as a
source of hard practical advice to decision
makers who want to shape a better tax
system, do justice to the poor, improve
social programs, reform budget procedures,
fight unemployment, and so on. And in the
process, the frontiers of normative economics,
both theoretical and empirical,
have been pushed out into the areas of
education, health, racism, crime, family
behavior, and even political behavior.
As a result, we have plunged ever deeper
into the realm of values. Not that it was
a value-free inquiry to ask the traditional
questions about the effect of a given policy
on material output. But surely the testing
of policies by the costs they incur and how
effective they are in meeting some generally
accepted criteria of social welfare or
general welfare involves economics directly
in value and distributional problems.
Aid it enables economics to say important
things on social policy issues within the
framework of the conventional economic
paradigm and with rigor of the non-mortis
variety.

We are becoming interdisciplinary in
spite of ourselves. When we do it, of course,
we don't think of it as cross-sterilization
of disciplines. But here is an area where
modesty becomes us. For if we confine
ourselves too narrowly to economics, we
are far too likely to attribute to economic
variables the behavior and results that are
really a response to social variables. Fearing
just that, one observer has been unkind
enough to suggest that we ought to
stick to inflation problems where we all
know what to say.

V. The Economist and Inflation
Inflation may no longer be "Public
Enemy Number One" now that severe recession
is upon us, but it is surely "Economists'
Enemy Number One." Among the

charges of, by, and against economists
that have been touched off by doubledigit
inflation and reported in the public
prints are these:

Economists have confessed (I plead
guilty) that 1973 was "the year of infamy
in inflation forecasting" and, as
already noted, that "we were caught
with our parameters down."

Aaron Gordon puts it more explicitly
when he says that "the forecasters fell
flat on their faces in predicting price
changes because they didn't have any
way of estimating sectoral supply scarcity"
and adds that we have not "even
started to develop a theory of aggregate
supply."

Leontief scolds macroeconomists more
generally: "There is a lot of fancy methodology,
but the macroeconomists get

indigestion if you give them facts."
I As an example of the "Age of Quantification,"
George Stigler cites the sea of studies on regulatory
practices and their costs and benefits in the past dozen
years, where there was a vacuum before. He notes that
thirty-six "quantitative studies of effects of laws" were
reported in two journals alone during this period, the
Joutrnal of Law and Economics and the Journal of
Political Economy. These are promoting a broader
consensus within the profession, informing decision
makers, and posing challenges that will make policy
failures easier to identify. (Personal correspondence.)


### ---Economics-1975-0-18.txt---
We are reminded ad nauseam that the
"new economists" of the 1960's had
promised to fine-tune inflation out of
their full employment economy (a clearcut
triumph of caricature over fact
since Keynesians time and again warned
of precisely the opposite danger).
Myrdal and Heilbroner have pointed
to stagflation as Exhibit A that economists
typically lag rather than lead
their targets, that being "behind its
time" is "the regular methodological
weakness of establishment economics."
Von Hayek recently reentered the
fray to lay the blame for worldwide
inflation squarely at the door of economists,
particularly those "who have

embraced the teachings of Lord
Keynes."

Apart from the charge that Keynesian
economists have caused inflation (which
is much like saying that the cause of forest
fires is trees), the bill of particulars against
macroeconomics runs something like this:
First, it did not forewarn the body politic
that it would have to pay such a high
price in endemic inflation for the attainment
of high employment. Second, its
progress in solving some important puzzles
of endemic inflation relating, for
example, to the Phillips curve, wage inflation,
expectations, and uncertainty is
much too slow. Third, there is no articulated
genefal theory of inflation as such.
Fourth, economists failed to foresee the
1973-74 epidemic inflation because their
forecasting models lacked the central
supply and price parameters. Fifth, macroeconomics
is helpless in the face of epidemic
or external-shock inflation-indeed,
it has not satisfactorily explained the coexistence
of inflation and recession, or
stagflation. Without attempting a pointby-
point assessment of these complaints,
I will touch on all of them in the following
sympathetic interpretation of how economists
are coping with inflation's tough
analytic and empirical challenges.
Addressing myself for a moment to our
reproachful public, let me simply say to
them: "We never promised you a rose
garden without thorns." Over most of the
past thirty years, macroeconomists have
warned again and again, first, that aggressive
fiscal and monetary policy to

manage aggregate demand was bound to
generate inflationary pressures once the
economy entered the full employment
zone, and second, that while full employment
spells inflation, recessions run into
price and wage rigidities that thwart deflation,
an asymmetry bound to produce a
ratchet effect on the price level. Keynes
himself foresaw the basic problem in his
little book, How to Pay for the War, in
1940. Abba Lerner and William Beveridge
also wrote of the problem in the early
1940's. And it has been discussed in the
stabilization theory and policy literature,
in congressional hearings, and in other
policy forums ever since.

This country finally embraced activist
fiscal policies for full employment in the
1960's, most explicitly in the 1964 tax cut.
Following the canons of Keynesian economics,
focussing on the economy's full
employment potential as their target, and
steadfastly rejecting a spate of "structural"
explanations of unemployment,

economists were at first alone in prescribing
tax cuts as a tonic for the stagnant
economy. Enacted early in 1964, the tax
cut delivered the promised expansion and
budget balance without inflation. By
August 1965, when Vietnam escalation
began, unemployment had been brought
to 4.4 percent with only the faintest stirring
of the inflationary beast (i.e., with
consumer prices rising at less than a 2 percent
annual rate).

In a very real sense, economists have
been victims of their own success. Macroeconomic


### ---Economics-1975-0-19.txt---
policy, capped by the tax cut,
was the major force holding the postwar
economy on a vastly higher plane than
the prewar economy.5 On one hand, the
high employment, limited-recession economy
forged with our macro-economic
policy tools is indeed an inflation-prone
economy the formula for successful management
of high-pressure prosperity is far
more elusive than the formula for getting
there. Yet on the other hand, success bred
great expectations on the part of the public
that economics could deliver prosperity
without inflation and with ever-growing
material gains in the bargain. The message
got through that we had "harnessed the
existing economics . . . to the purposes of
prosperity, stability, and growth," and
that as to the role of the tax cut in breaking
old molds of thinking, "nothing succeeds
like success" (Heller). The Economist
unkindly corrected me: "Nothing exceeds
like success."6

To be sure, critics and converts alike
ignored our caveats that the goal of
"prosperity without a price-wage spiral"
had "eluded not only this country but all
of its industrial partners in the free world,"
that "the margin for error diminishes as
the economy reaches the treasured but
treacherous area of full employment. . .
and that "the 'new economics' promises
no money-back guarantees against occasional
slowdowns or even recessions"

(Heller).

All too soon, Vietnam blew the economy
off-course. Economists found that in the
political arena fiscal policy was not a twoway
street and that the much delayed surtax
adopted in mid-1968 was no match for
surging inflation. Nor was the induced recession
of 1969-70. It took a combination
of the 1971 shock therapy of tight wageprice
controls and the stimulus of tax cuts
to subdue inflation and energize expansion.
It is worth noting that economists analyzed
and projected the effects of this
''new economic policy" with exceptional
precision. That the tax cuts, coupled with
controls and devaluation, would generate a
surging expansion at very moderate rates
of inflation in .1972 was widely and accurately
forecast.

But the period from August 1971 to
January 1973 was in the nature of a remission
from the inflationary disease,
clearly not a cure. The 1969-70 recession
brought home the worsening problem of
persistent inflation in the face of slowdown
and recession. It presented new
empirical puzzles for the analysts of the
Phillips curve, wage equations, and expectational
inflation. And it began to prompt
the public mutterings that are being intensified
by the 1974-75 stagflation: "All
right, so you did not promise us a rose
garden without thorns-but the thorns
without the rose garden?"

Keenly aware of these problems, economists
have long been at the drawing

boards on this problem of endemic inflation.
In a close parallel with research on
cancer, economists are working on various
pieces of the inflation puzzle and producI
As gauges of the contrast between prewar and postwar
performance: unemployment averaged 18.8 percent
in the decade of depression (1931-40) in contrast
with 4.8 percent in the twenty-eight years since World
War II; the prewar peak annual rate was 24.9 percent,
the postwar peak was 6.8 percent. Annual real GNP
dropped 30 percent from 1929 to 1933; since the war,
mild declines have occurred only in three years (1949,
1954, and 1970), though 1974-75 may add two more.
Consumer prices in 1940 were 18 percent below 1929;
from 1948 to 1974, they increased 106 percent.
6 Macroeconomists were not alone in their exuberance
in the mid-1960's. On this rostrum a decade ago,
George Stigler, after reviewing the great promises and
early accomplishments of the "Quantitative Revolution
in Economics," was moved to say, "I am convinced
that economics is finally at the threshold of its Golden
Age-nay, we already have one foot through the door.
... Our expanding theoretical and empirical studies
will inevitably and irresistibly enter into the subject of
public policy, and we shall develop a body of knowledge
essential to intelligent policy formulation. And
then, quite frankly, I hope that we become the ornaments
of democratic society whose opinions on economic
policy shall prevail."


### ---Economics-1975-0-20.txt---
ing useful insights and guidance for policy
purposes. But as economists, we would be
the first to underscore that these puzzles
are far from being fitted into an articulated
and holistic theory of inflation. Inflationary
analysis appears as an appendage to
Keynesian and monetarist theories. But
as yet, the Keynesian apparatus cannot
tell us how any given change in aggregate
demand is divided between changes in
real output and changes in prices. Nor has
monetarist theory unlocked the puzzle of
how the effects of monetary changes are
divided between output and price level
changes. And no big breakthrough is in
sight.

Does this mean that the economist has
to stand mute in the meanwhile? Not at
all. He is pushing ahead on the various
pieces of basic research on the cancer of
inflation and isolating and prescribing
effectively for particular forms of the
cancer even without having a complete
explanation of the disease. Let me come
back to the sustained and systematic research
efforts on endemic inflation after
examining the 1973-74 epidemic and the
economist's responses to it. Since the
epidemic is an over-layer on the endemic
base, the distinctions won't be clear-cutbut
they are nonetheless useful for viewing
what the economist is able to contribute
to policy.

The food-fuel price bulge generated over
half of the 1973-74 inflation-and of
economists' woes as well. Yet, it is asking
a lot of economists to expect them to have
foreseen that the oil cartel would quadruple
oil prices, that the world would suffer
widespread and successive crop failures,
that the Peruvian anchovies would go into
hiding, and that the Soviets would "solve
our surplus grain problem" overnight.
Several unpleasant policy surprises also
beset the inflation forecasters. First, just
when a new rash of inflation was breaking
out early in 1973, the reasonably effective
Phase II controls were abruptly dropped
in favor of the weak and ineffective Phase
III. Second, six months later, after inflation
had changed into a commodity-driven
structural phenomenon involving a drastic
readjustment of relative prices, the White
House (to the pained surprise of economists
inside and outside the administration)
prescribed just the wrong medicine,
a new wage-price freeze. A third policy
surprise was that the dollar was allowed
to sink like a stone: At its low point in the
summer of 1973 (just before a substantial
rebound), relative prices of imports had
risen 10 percent in six months. About a
quarter of the 1973 inflation has been attributed
to these policy developments

(see William Nordhaus and John Shoven).
It is worth noting that unexpected
twists and turns of federal policy which
might be termed "internal shocks" in
contrast with the "external shocks" of the
food-fuel price explosion-are a continuing
bane of the forecaster's existence. The
about-face of the Federal Reserve in 1974
is another painful case in point. The sharp
turn from ease to tightness in the first
quarter of the year was a major factor in
transforming prospects of recovery into
recession in the second half of 1974. It is
not quite clear why economists should be
better at anticipating these shocks, especially
the external ones, than society as
a whole, or other professional specialists,
or practical men of the world. Nothing in
statistical methodology or economic science
enables us to predict random shocks.
What can be expected of us is that when
they occur, we will spot them quickly,
identify them, and analyze their significance
for policy.

It is also worth remembering that
democratic governments, by their nature,
are pressure-responders rather than problem-
anticipators. This carries two implications
for political economists. On one
hand, if an idea's time has not yet come,


### ---Economics-1975-0-21.txt---
or if a problem has not yet become a crisis,
the economist's call for action is likely to
go unheeded. On the other, spotting
emergent problems early can perhaps
hasten an idea's time and alert the policy
makers to impending danger.

Economists can more readily be faulted
for being caught by surprise by the shortages
of materials and primary processing
capacity that caused the economy to
bump against its ceiling sooner than expected
and by the worldwide economic

boom that put severe pressure on raw
commodity supplies and prices. On the
first point, we suffered both from information
failure-the official capacity indexes
simply did not reveal how close the economy
was to its output ceilings-and from
analytic limits. While identifying the
causes, economists have been unable to
pinpoint the relative significance of the
shortfall of investment that began in the
late 1960's, of underinvestment caused by
price controls, of delays induced by environmental
policies, and of the surge in

foreign demand touched off by devaluation.
However, I should add that the
shortages problem is meat and drink for
economists, and they are responding (especially
in the energy field) with new

analyses of price elasticities, investment
needs, and the like. All of a sudden, price
theory is back in vogue, and elasticities
have replaced multipliers as the badge of a
policy maker's savoir faire.

Delays in perceiving that the U.S. economic
expansion was part of a worldwide
upsurge can again be laid more to lack of
an adequate information system than to
any inability to understand the underlying
principles. Still, a better sense of history
and of the emerging worldwide imbalance
between growing aspirations and
growing incomes on one hand and inelastic
resource supply and lagging technology
on the other would have made us more
conscious and cautious. We are considerably
less likely to be caught by surprise in
the future in view of the new worldwide
data networks that are being developed by
Project LINK at the University of Pennsylvania
and by Otto Eckstein and his

colleagues at Data Resources Incorporated
(DRJ).

Without absolving economists, one
should apply this operational test: With
proper foresight, would tighter monetary
and budget policy have been able to
damp inflation? It is worth recalling, first,
that the full employment budget was
making a swing of over $10 billion towards
restraint between fiscal 1973 and fiscal
1974 (from a $2 billion deficit to a $10
billion surplus under the old 4 percent unemployment
standard) and that monetary

policy pushed interest rates into the
double-digit region; second, that there was
little that an aggregate demand squeeze
could have done to push world commodity
prices down. So the answer is clear: Even
tougher fiscal and monetary policy would
have had limited scope in holding inflation
down.

This is not to deny that generating a
larger full employment surplus would
have been the prudent course in calendar
1973. But it is worth noting that to offset
the food and fuel price explosions-which
were triggered by forces largely immune to
U.S. fiscal and monetary policy-would
have required a reduction of 3 percent in
all other prices. Such a target implies depression-
inducing doses of fiscal and monetary
restriction, an unthinkable "solution.
"

Looking toward the future, many economists
draw the lesson not that one should
keep the economy's motor idling,' but
rather that one should provide it with
safety devices and heavy-duty shock absorbers,
for example, stock-piling of foodstuffs,
oil, and basic raw materials, careful
tracking of commodity exports, distant
early warning systems to spot shortagesin-the-making,


### ---Economics-1975-0-22.txt---
and conservation and development
measures to limit dependence

on foreign raw materials cartels. In other
words, it is a call for better planning,
better data, and faster conversion of
knowledge into policy.

Another criterion of economists' responses
to inflationary shocks is how

quickly they adapted (read, "disaggregated"
) their macromodels, large and
small, to incorporate new supply and price
parameters that had previously been
judged of second or third order importance
and hence relegated to Marshall's ceteris
paribus pound. Some of the mongrel pups
impounded there turned out to be full
blooded huskies, for example, food prices,
the exchange value of the dollar, oil and
other raw material supplies and prices. At
first most economists were slow and the big
models sluggish in their responses. After
all, for two decades prices had moved in
tandem with wages, with a year-by-year
percentage-point differential of 23+ 1. So
most models relied on wage trends, with
some adjustment for productivity and
capacity behavior, to give them a fix on
price trends. Their eyes were on labor
market indicators rather than commodity
supplies, exchange rates, and the like.
After some initial delays, the model builders
scrambled to disaggregate, to build
microelements into their macromodels.
For example, DRI now has good stage-ofprocessing
models that absorb the impacts
of food and energy explosions. Price elasticities
are being built into the macromodels
to reflect the impact of massive
relative price changes on the macrodimensions
of the economy.

The whole experience reminds us of the
role and limits of econometric forecasting
models. First, the combination of computers,
mathematics, and econometrics

cannot produce the miracles that the uninitiated
may expect of them-there is no
way of replicating reality with its 3 million
equations, all of them non-linear. Second,
their indispensable function is to bring us
closer to reality and help the mind manage
the previously unmanageable-they permit
us to release vastly more animals from
the ceteris paribus pound than we could
manage without these tools. Third, they
have to be constantly adjusted to plug in
common sense, adjust the length of the
lags, and bring in new dimensions of the
problem. Else, they will lock out things
that a more judgmental approach would
include, and will fail to respond quickly to
changes in order of importance.
So the inflation-shock experience has
brought home the need not just to watch
supply but to watch all the pieces lest the
model prevail over the mind, rather than
having the model help the mind prevail
over matter. The macro-stalactites have
to reach toward the micro-stalagmites, and
vice versa. I hope that metaphor is not a
portent of the pace at which the advance
toward macro-micro fusion will proceed.
Economists who use judgmental models
have shown us how to be the master
rather than the slave of the computer. A
case in point was the early analysis (especially
by George Perry) of the macroimpact
of the oil price increases. A year
ago, his work had already brought out the
oil paradox-the inflation of costs and
hence prices, leading to a deflation of aggregate
demand-and had provided some

estimates of both. The insight that some
$15 to $20 billion of consumer purchasing
power would be siphoned off into the
hands of oil producers and royalty collectors
without any early return to the
economy in the form of demand for imports
or investment goods had important
implications for demand-management policy-
implications that were ignored until
severe recession was full upon us.7


### ---Economics-1975-0-23.txt---
These important insights into the
macro-economic policy implications of oil
prices fit into the broader efforts of economists
to disentangle the sources of the
current inflation and identify the appropriate
remedies. They differentiate among
(1) excess demand, which had spent
most of its force by early in 1974, (2) the
price-wage-price spiral, which began to
turn more rapidly in 1974, and (3) external-
shock or special-sector inflation, in
particular, the commodity-price surges
that permeate the present inflation and
account for its special character and
ferocity.

The first responds rather readily to
monetary-fiscal pressure, the second responds
more reluctantly, and the third is
highly resistant to the demand-management
measures of any given country. For
the second and especially the third types,
therefore, high costs in unemployment and
foregone output have to be incurred for
small gains in curbing inflation. So the distinction
is an instructive one for policyeven
when the instructions are ignored.
As we meet here tonight, the economic
lessons that were so long ignored are being
painfully driven home by severe recession
and unemployment coupled with continuing
inflation. A much-belated consensus
that fiscal and monetary stimulus can now
be undertaken with minimal inflationary
risk is rapidly forming.

The economists' three-ply classification
of inflation sources is also useful in driving
home another point: In most U.S. inflations,
consisting of the first two types, one
person's price is another person's income,
so that in spite of some reshuffling, there
is no net loss in real income. Not so in
1973-75. Commodity inflation has transferred
tens of billions of dollars of real income
out of the pockets of urban consumers
and wage earners into the hands of
farmers and foreigners where it is beyond
the reach of the collective bargaining
process. From this, several important
inferences can be drawn:

Point for point, this inflation cum
relative price changes is harsher in its
impact than previous postwar inflations.
In this "no-win" inflation, the wage
earner's loss has not generally been the
employer's gain; hence, if the wage
"catch-up" process succeeds in recouping
the full rise in the cost of living,
much of the wage increase will pass
through to prices and thereby give the
wage-price spiral another self-defeating
turn.

It follows, as various economists
urged throughout 1974, that tax cuts to
bolster the real income of labor, if put in
the context of a social contract, might
well relieve some of the pressure for
higher wages.

In this respect, today's situation contrasts
rather sharply with the 1950-51 inflation
when a similarly rapid run-up in world
commodity prices was accompanied by a
rapid rise in profit margins side-by-side
with vigorous federal policies to boost
capacity. The ensuing combination of
ebbing world market prices and wage increases
that could be granted without

generating higher product prices resulted
in a remarkable four-year period of price
stability from 1952 to 1956.

A closely allied economic insight goes to
the nature of the inflationary process. It
scale formal models. His analysis shows that the purchasing
power loss had reached $37 billion (annual rate)
by the third quarter of 1974 and that the rise in the
deflator attributable to the oil price jump was 3.8 percent.
His analysis embraced not only the real-income
effect (the transfer of real income from consumers to
producers), but also the monetary-policy effect (the
reduction of the real value of the money stock and the
rise in interest rates stemming from the highly inelastic
short-run demand for petroleum products), the automobile-
demand effect (higher saving), and the inducedinflation
effect (the price-wage-price effect) of the oil
price rise on the macroeconomy.


### ---Economics-1975-0-24.txt---
explains in good part why inflation is so
stubborn even in the face of overly restrictive
monetary-fiscal policy and rapidly
mounting unemployment and slack in the
economy. It is the sharp run-up in relative
prices of food, fuel, and imported goodscoupled
with the downward rigidities of
wages and prices that is the key to most
of our stagflationary malaise today.
These downward rigidities are a striking
example of the way in which economic
solutions create their own problems and
move the economist relentlessly from one
new frontier to another. Once macroeconomics
gave governments the know-how

and tools of modern demand-management
to avoid depression, and once the public
caught on that even recessions are essentially
man-made-chiefly by That Man in
the White House, whoever he is, together
with the Congress and the Federal Reserve
Board-it became part of the politics of
survival to hold employment high and
keep recessions in check. Absent the fears
of mass unemployment and prolonged
recession, the risks of not cutting prices
and not accepting lower wages are minimized.
Having put the Great Depression
of the 1930's far behind us, will we therefore
have to live with the Great Inflation
of the 1970's?

Essentially, the economist answers that,
given the ratchet behavior of wages and
prices, the price level can only float upward
to accommodate the massive relative
price increases of oil, grains, certain raw
materials, and imported goods. These
sharp changes in the composition of supply
touch off reverberating price increases
throughout the economy as prices in the
scarce-supply sectors become costs in the
less-scarce ones. The reverberations go on
-in substantial part independent of the
state of aggregate demand and hence of
monetary and fiscal policy-until the
prices of the initiating goods have risen
sufficiently farther than prices in general
to accomplish the necessary realignment
of relative prices. This is the process going
on now. It takes time, but not forever. It
has much to do with double-digit inflation,
but it does not condemn us to Weimar
Republic inflation.

Solow (1975) reminds us that the supply-
shift phenomenon bears a close relationship
to the demand-shift analysis of
the creeping inflation of the mid-1950's.
At that time, the parallel process was
touched off by an investment boom that
put excess demand pressures on capital
goods industries even when there was no
excess aggregate demand in the economy.
Given the downward rigidity and costoriented
nature of wages and prices in

areas of excess market power, the price
level had to float upward to accommodate
those relative price changes (see Schultze
(1959)).

John Dunlop and other economists have
emphasized that there is a closely related
phenomenon on the wage side known as
"scale wages" or "wage relativities" or
even a "just wage" (see Robert Hall and
Michael Piore). If the relative wage scale
is thrown out of kilter by an outsized
wage settlement in one industry, the others
will writhe, twist, and turn until the old
relationships are reestablished. There is
only one way the wage structure can move
to accommodate this process: Up. Again,
the process burns itself out only when a
new equilibrium has been established on a
higher plateau.

The policy implications of the supplyshift,
demand-shift, and wage-shift insights
are reasonably clear. One is the
limited scope of repressive monetary-fiscal
policy in coping with this process. Another
is that the key to a successful wageprice
policy for these circumstances is
to establish and effectuate norms for the
pace-setters and thus thwart the wagewage
and price-price spirals and the interacting
wage-price spiral. Once the process


### ---Economics-1975-0-25.txt---
is launched, the role of a wage-price
watchdog with teeth would be to see to it
that the adjustment process is a limited
and straightforward one, not a leapfrogging
sequence that will prolong the agony
of adjustment. Again, understanding the
economics of the process is the sine qua
non for shaping the right policy to fit the
particular type and phase of inflation that
is beleaguering us.

Let me return now, before closing, to
several of the abiding problems of endemic
inflation that are engaging the attention
and efforts of economists.

An important but' elusive question for
the policy maker concerns the costs of
inflation. Can the economist tell him
anything useful and definitive on this
subject? Useful, perhaps. Definitive, no.
First, the economist would remind him
that people continually blame inflation for
crimes it does not commit. They are sure
that every increase in their pay envelope
is a reward for merit, every increase in
prices an inflationary theft. Especially
pertinent to our present shock-spiral is
the observation that people "blame inflation
for changes in relative prices and in
real incomes that stem from market forces
that have nothing to do with the course of
the general price level" (Edward Foster).
Second, studies show that in a typical
U.S. inflation, the poor have gained more
in jobs and incomes than they have lost in
higher prices. But in the present inflation,
prices have shifted sharply against the
poor, and any initial gains they may have
made in jobs and income in 1973 have been
more than offset by the losses incurred in
the deepening 1974-75 recession induced
to fight inflation.

Third, at the rates of inflation experienced
prior to the 1973-75 explosion, most
economists find it difficult to believe that
the costs of inflation-mostly in redistributional
effects, but with some distortion
in resource allocation-hold a candle
to the welfare losses of substantial add-ons
to unemployment. Fourth, however, when
inflation reaches double-digit levels, the
costs in terms of the social conflicts and
tensions it generates and the uncertainties
and loss of confidence in the dollar yardstick
it may breed are important intangibles
that economists cannot ignore, yet
have not been able to quantify. We need
to understand far more about what unsettles
and upsets people about inflation,
how this affects their economic behavior,
and what economic costs result. Clearly,
in an economy where inflation is endemic,
the balance between its gains and losses
deserves intensive further study.
Another important question is this:
How much of the present run-up in prices
of foodstuffs, oil, and raw materials is a
transitory phenomenon, how much is a
one-time shift to a new plateau, and how
much represents a new upward trend?
Economists have trained the guns of price
theory and price elasticity estimation on
these questions in the case of oil and several
other basic materials. They generally
come up with more optimistic answers
for five to ten years hence than for the
near-term. But much of the answer lies
in geo-political, meteorological, and similar
puzzles-for example, the effectiveness
of oil and other raw material cartels,
the pace of world population increases
and income growth, and the possibility of
a dry, cold phase in world weather-that
lie largely or wholly beyond the reach of
economic analysis.

What we do know is this: The 1950's
and the 1960's were a period of gently declining
or roughly stable world prices for
raw materials or foodstuffs. Now, rising
population, industrialization, income, and
aspirations may put such pressure on the
world's supply capabilities that while we
are not nearing any Club-of-Rome ultimate
limits, we may for some time exceed
the speed limits of stable expansion. If so


### ---Economics-1975-0-26.txt---
we may have passed an inflection point in
the price trends of basic inputs to the economy
(see Walt Rostow). The mild downward
trend of the 1951-71 period facilitated
the rise in real incomes of urban workers
side-by-side with rising profits. If this trend
is reversed, rising income claims will generate
greater strains, and the Phillips
curve tradeoff will take place around a
higher inflation constant. Economic analysis
of long-run supply prices of basic
commodities using alternative assumptions
regarding world political, weather,
and economic trends could be a useful aid
to rational economic planning.
Coming back into the domain of economics
as such, one should take account of
the important new thinking and efforts
now being devoted to the continuing
mysteries of industrial pricing policies and
the role of fixed-rule (generally, mark-up)
pricing as a shield against uncertainty.
Answering the question of how, and how
fast, supply-shifts in the auction markets
or market-oriented sector are transmitted
through the rule-determined sectorwhere
certain relativities seem to be maintained
in the structure of prices (and
wages)-is essential to an understanding
of structural inflation (see Piore).
In turn, this analysis will strongly influence
thinking on government intervention
in private wage-price and perhaps
also supply-demand decisions. If the wageprice
structure is indeed fairly rigid and if
supply- and demand-shifts set off an inflationary
spiral, the "natural market

forces" will not readily make the necessary
supply-demand adjustment in any case.
Wage-price restraint or controls would not
be supplanting some supple and efficient
resource allocation mechanism, yet would
insert a circuit breaker into the inflationary
spiral. This view of the world would
also suggest that government action to
stimulate supply and suppress demand at
certain pressure points in the economy
might well pass the test of economic efficiency.
In pursuing these questions and
hypotheses, the economist will be laying a
firmer conceptual and empirical foundation
for specifying the areas and circumstances
in which intervention may be the
lesser evil.

One should not leave the subject of
economists' contributions to analysis and
prescription on the inflation problem
without mention of the intriguing attempt
of the Brookings Panel on Economic
Activity to bring the best analytical and
empirical efforts of economists to bear directly
on the problems and puzzles that
confront the policymaker. In relation to
inflation, the Panel has focussed much of
its attention on such questions as the
structure of labor markets, the Phillips
curve relationship and wage equations,
the costs of unemployment, price behavior
in specific sectors like foodstuffs and oil,
and the role of fiscal and monetary
policies. Apart from the significant contributions
that have been made to understanding
these problems, and to bringing
academic work into closer contact with
current policy problems, the Brookings
Panel is an interesting and perhaps unique
exercise in "continuing confrontational
econometrics." Responding to the kinds of
criticisms quoted earlier in my remarks,
the Brookings Panel combines rigorous
quantitative testing with continuing surveillance
by one's peers to assure that the
investigator (a) looks beyond mathematics
and makes his assumptions and- relations
conform to common sense, (b) spells
out the implications of his econometrics
and, if they are implausible, tries again,
and (c) constantly keeps asking questions
of the model. With the Panel now going
into its sixth year of thrice-yearly meetings,
previous analyses become not undisturbed
museum pieces, but grist for the
mill of constant retesting under the harsh
light of reality and peer-group criticism.


### ---Economics-1975-0-27.txt---
I have dealt at some length with the
substance of economists' work and findings
on inflation because mere assertions of
progress would hardly suffice to demonstrate
what's right with economics in this
most vulnerable area. The fact that there
are no final or comprehensive answers
has not kept economists from making
significant distinctions, analyses, and measurements
that equip policy makers with

better means of judging the policy tradeoffs
and determining how to improve the
fit of policy-to-problem for the different
types and stages of inflation. When policy
makers fail to heed these lessons, as in
1974, both the economy and the economist
feel the backlash.

Throughout this discourse, I have time
and again been tempted to kick over the
traces I fastened on myself and give voice
to my own criticisms, dissatisfactions, and
admonitions. But since an unholy (and unwitting)
alliance of my colleagues and outside
critics has amply and ably taken care
of this, I felt it best to stay within my constraints
in the interest of doing what I
could do to redress the balance. As economists,
we have many sins, none deadly,
to confess. But these are far outweighed
by the virtues, all quite lively, that we can
legitimately profess.

The title of this paper summarizes the
two-fold theme to which I want to address
myself this evening. First, the mainstream
of economic theory sacrifices far too much
relevance in its insistent pursuit of ever
increasing rigor. And, second, we economists
pay too little attention to the changing
institutional environment that conditions
economic behavior. We do not often
enough reexamine our basic postulates in
light of changes in this environment, and,
perhaps more important, we shy away
from the big questions about how and why
the institutional structure is changingand
where it is taking us.'

I

Economists pride themselves on belonging
to the most "scientific" of the social
sciences. The justification for this contention
lies in the growing resemblance between
the nature of the analytical tools
used in economics and in the natural
sciences-above all, the increasing use of
mathematical tools in theoretical analysis
and the development of sophisticated
mathematical and statistical techniques in
empirical work. Today, mathematically
formulated economic theory, the development
of econometric techniques, and the
sophisticated application of econometric
methods to the "testing of hypotheses" in
a variety of applied fields constitute the
core of the science of economics.2
What is science? One brief definition
runs: "A systematic knowledge of the
physical or material world." Most definitions
emphasize the two elements in this
definition: (1) "systematic knowledge"
about (2) the real world. Without pushing
this definitional question to its metaphysical
limits, I merely want to suggest that if
economics is to be a science, it must not
only develop analytical tools but must also
apply them to a world that is now observable
or that can be made observable
through improved methods of observation
and measurement. Or in the words of the
Hungarian mathematical economist J'anos
Kornai, "In the real sciences, the criterion
is not whether the proposition is logically
true and tautologically deducible from
earlier assumptions. The criterion of 'truth'
is, whether or not the proposition corresponds
to reality" (p. 9, his italics). (Compare
Wassily Leontief 1966, p. 23.)
One of our most distinguished historians
of economic thought, George Stigler, has
stated that: "The dominant influence upon
the working range of economic theorists is
the set of internal values and pressures of


### ---Economics-1976-0-04.txt---
the discipline. The subjects of study are
posed by the unfolding course of scientific
developments" (p. 22). He goes on to add:
"This is not to say that the environment is
without influence...... "But, he continues,
"whether a fact or development is significant
depends primarily on its relevance to
current economic theory" (p. 23). (Compare
Tjalling Koopmans, p. 170.) What a
curious relating of rigor to relevance!
Whether the real world matters depends
presumably on "its relevance to current
economic theory." Many if not most of today'
s economic theorists seem to agree
with this ordering of priorities.3
To what aspects of the observable world
does economics apply its analytical tools?
According to the familiar definition in the
International Encyclopedia of the Social
Sciences, which we owe originally to Lionel
Robbins, economics "is the study of the
allocation of scarce resources among unlimited
and competing uses." To this definition
of microeconomics the Encyclopedia
then rather weakly adds macroeconomics,
which is defined as the study of
money, the general price level, and the
level of output and employment.
Let us consider the microeconomic part
of this definition. Presumably the reference
is to real resources, used to produce observable
goods and services, that are exchanged
and consumed by real people living
in the kind of world we see around us.
Of course, some degree of abstraction is
necessary if useful generalizations are to be
reached. Here the economic theorist quickly
runs up against a dilemma. Shall he seek to
make his analysis ever more rigorous, regardless
of the possibly diminishing relevance
of his conclusions to the observed
world? Or shall he sacrifice elegant refinement
for somewhat cruder analysis that
may lead to testable results? I suppose the
reply can be given that we need to do both
and that we need specialists in each of
these approaches. But certainly those who
construct the analytical apparatus should
pay more attention than many of them
now do to the substantive problems with
which economists are presumably concerned.

In speaking of how well current microeconomic
theory combines rigor and relevance,
I should distinguish among the
different but interrelated problem areas
with which this part of economic theory
concerns itself. Micro theory addresses itself
primarily to three related topics: (1)
the conditions necessary for, and the means
of actually achieving, an optimum allocation
of resources within decision-making
units, both firms and households, under
given assumptions as to the criteria of optimization;
(2) again under given assumptions,
the conditions necessary for the
existence of a general (or partial) equilibrium
among all (or some) of these decisionmaking
units, including the determination
of the uniqueness and stability of such an
equilibrium; and (3) the conditions required
for the achievement of an economic
optimum from a broad, social point of
view.

Some success has been achieved in blending
rigor and relevance in the theory of the
single decision-making unit. Certainly, as
this year's Nobel prize in economics attests,
considerable progress has been achieved in
dealing with production planning in the
individual firm or establishment (or government
department) for which mathematical
tools, including programming and
the whole range of activity analysis, have
proved to be useful. To some extent, howI
This has led Leontief to expostulate: "Seldom, in
modern positive science, has so elaborate a theoretical
structure been erected on so narrow and shallow a
factual foundation" (1966, p. 33). Compare also Nicholas
Kaldor, p. 1240, and Martin Shubik (1970).
I For a careful and judicious defense of theoretical
models, see Koopman's second essay. He also adds:
"Precision and rigor in the statement of premises and
proofs can be expected to have a sobering effect on our
beliefs about the reach of the propositions we have developed"
(p. 147).


### ---Economics-1976-0-05.txt---
ever, the success achieved here makes this
part of economics resemble more a branch
of engineering than a social science. And at
the level of the individual firm some progress
continues to be made in empirical
studies of production and cost functions,
the determinants of the demand for inputs,
the transmission of technical change, and
related topics. I do not wish to minimize
the value of this work. But we should not
ignore the extent to which rigorous formulations
of the theory of the firm have had
to be relaxed in order to obtain useful results
in empirical work. Nor, I might add,
should we forget the extent to which conventional
theory ignores how and why

work is organized within the firm and
establishment in the way that it is, what
may be called the "social relations" of the
production process.

Some success in blending rigor and relevance
has also been achieved in the field of
household behavior-ranging from studies
of the determinants of consumers' demand
to recent work on human capital, the behavior
of labor markets, the economics of
crime, and the like. I must confess to some
skepticism, however, about the relevance
of the economic models of household behavior
recently developed by Gary Becker
and his followers-what has been referred
to as "the new home economics." Granted
that much useful work has been done in
this area. Nonetheless there is a lamentable
tendency among scholars in this field to
rely upon a caricature of human beings
who continuously and consciously balance
costs and benefits at the margin, whether
in deciding on another year of schooling,
whether and when to marry or be divorced,
how many children to have and when, or
whether and when to commit a crime. And
after a substantial amount of intensive research,
the human capital approach still
leaves unexplained a significant part of the
differences in personal incomes.
In the second area mentioned, particularly
general equilibrium theory, it seems
to me that relevance has been largely absent
in the recent literature. To find much
relevance at the theoretical level, and I
refer here only to the theoretical literature,
we must go back to the partial-equilibrium
analysis of Alfred Marshall and his followers.
Walras, Pareto, and their successors-
with their assumptions of atomistic
competition, perfectly flexible prices, costless
information, and limitless futures markets-
have contributed little to relevance
in their steadfast pursuit of rigor. Although
a step in the right direction, recent attempts
to develop a pure theory of disequilibrium
are subject to much the same

criticism.

Rigor and relevance have been successfully
blended in input-output analysis,
although largely at the expense of ignoring
the price sensitivity of input-output coefficients.
Here again, the emphasis is on
engineering-type relationships, but in this
case the entire economy is the object of
study.

Micro-economic analysis, as I have noted,
concerns itself with "the allocation of
scarce resources among unlimited and competing
uses." As economists we are concerned
with how resources may be allocated
efficiently, and we are prepared to
provide the layman and the policymaker
with a rigorous definition of efficiency. But
"efficient allocation" for whose benefit? To
me it has always been startling that the
accepted province of micro-economic theory
has little room for the personal distribution
of income-and virtually none

for the personal distribution of wealth. Of
course, we speak of "distribution," but by
this we mean either factor prices or total
factor shares.

Why wealth and labor services, the latter
carrying widely different market-determined
prices, are distributed among different
human beings in the way they actually
are is a question that the non-Marxian


### ---Economics-1976-0-06.txt---
economic theorist seldom asks. An exception
should be made for the relevant literature
in the field of labor economics. Similarly,
some exception should be made for
the recent literature on human capital, but
at best it is only a partial exception.5 The
mathematically inclined general theorist
continues to show little interest in the determinants
of the personal distribution of
income and wealth.6 It has been said by
George Stigler that: "The problem of personal
income distribution will eventually
receive much theoretical attention, since
it is a problem of all economies and all
times" (p. 22). (Compare Becker, p. 135.)
But if the problem is so important, why
only "eventually"? It is not surprising
that many younger economists are seeking
a radical alternative for the neoclassical
framework, more or less along Marxian
lines. And it is also this concern with the
unequal personal distribution of opportunity
and income which has led to the
development of models of a dual labor market.
These models, with their emphasis on
institutional barriers to labor mobility,
offer some valuable insights into the operation
of contemporary labor markets, and
they also raise important questions about
some of the assumptions implicit in neoclassical
theory.7

From the point of view of human welfare-
a concept that will not go away no
matter how uncomfortable it makes the
economic theorist-can we ignore the personal
distribution of income? Which is
more relevant: a rigorous demonstration as
to how resources can be most efficiently
allocated under ideal conditions that have
never existed, or a much cruder exploration
of how wealth and income came to be distributed
as they in fact are and what might
be done to affect the distribution of income
in one way or another? As Alice Rivlin put
it in her Ely lecture last year (p. 2), economists
"worth their pay" ought to be able
to explain the shape of the income distribution
and why it is changing or not changing.
By this criterion very few of us are
worth our pay.8 To go further, why do
we have so little to say about the intergenerational
movement among occupational

and income classes, about the determinants
of the distribution of income

relative to those affecting the distribution
of wealth, and about the ethnic, social, political,
and regional factors affecting the
distribution of both wealth and income?
Am I suggesting that economic theory
become much more normative than it now
is? Of course I am not. "Relevant" and
"normative" are not synonyms, and what
I am alleging here is that neoclassical economics
has failed to be relevant in its
refusal to deal with the personal distribution
of income and wealth. This refusal
stems, I presume, fron the fact that, with
the analytical tools at hand, the problem
has seemed too difficult.

I should add in this connection that neoclassical
economics has always had a normative
slant. As others have suggested,
I In the second edition of Human Capital, pp. 94-144,
Becker republishes his earlier attempt to utilize the
human capital approach to sketch out a theory of per-
sonal income distributioin. See also Jacob Mincer.
6 On the various approaches to the study of the distribution
of income, see the useful volumes by Martin
Bronfenbrenner and Jan Pen. Interestingly, some
three-quarters or more of Bronfenbrenner's book is de-
voted to the functional distribution of income; only one
chapter is devoted entirely to "Topics in Personal Income
Distribution." Yet one reviewer criticized him, as
well as Pen, for devoting too much space "to the distributional
influence of institutional forces and to the
personal, as against functional, distribution of income"
(Charles E. Ferguson, p. 440). Pen's volume contains
a useful summary of the more important recent literature
on the determinants of the personal distribution
of income; and, interestingly, his longest chapter is
concerned with "norms and policies" for income redistribution.


7 Compare Arthur Okun (1973, pp. 237-46) and
Michael Wachter and the references there cited. Cairnes
and Marshall, of course, did talk about noncompeting
groups, but little of this has carried over into the main
body of current economic theory.
8 One who has recently earned his salary is Okun
(1975); see also James E. Meade and Alan Blinder. An
earlier example of an economist who "bucked the
trend" to discuss the personal distribution of income and
wealth was Hugh Dalton.


### ---Economics-1976-0-07.txt---
conventional micro-economic theory as it
has developed, particularly in the last
seventy-five years or so, takes a normative
stance by default.9 Indeed, it takes a
normative stance by more than default. It
says outright that the primary question to
which economists should address themselves
is the "optimum" allocation of resources,
and it insists on providing a precise
definition of optimum. (Compare
Ward, pp. 52-54, 90.) Since, as Koopmans
points out, competitive equilibrium theory
ignores the welfare implications of the personal
distribution of income that results,
"the term 'optimum' [is] a misnomer"
(p. 49). (See also Ward, pp. 197-98.)
My remarks thus far have been directed
toward microeconomics. But macro-economic
analysis also must face the problem
of how optimally to combine rigor and
relevance. What we today call macroeconomics
grew out of the catastrophe of
the Great Depression,'0 and in the early
development of macro-economic analysis
relevance took precedence over rigor. Today,
rigor competes with relevance in
macro-economic and monetary theory, and
in some lines of development macro and
monetary theorists, like many of their colleagues
in micro theory, seem to consider
relevance to be more or less irrelevant. A
good example has been the elaboration of
so-called growth theory Ahich now seems
to be losing some of its earlier popularity.
Apparently, there has come to be a growing
recognition that the considerable efforts
spent on growth models have not significantly
advanced knowledge beyond the

contributions of the original Harrod-Domar
and the Solow-Swan neoclassical models.
And other intriguing topics have arisen to
stimulate the pursuit of rigor at the expense
of relevance.

In both micro- and macroeconomics, efforts
are sometimes made to extract a drop
or two of relevance from exercises in analytical
rigor; and conclusions are drawn
about the functioning of some aspect of
the real world, or policy recommendations
are made, on the basis of theoretical exercises
which rest on assumptions that fly in
the face of the facts. One example is the
frequent fitting of the neoclassical investment
function, with its built-in assumptions
of constant returns and perfect competition,
to industries in which these assumptions
obviously do not hold. Another
example is a good deal of the recent literature
seeking to reformulate the microeconomic
foundations of macro-economic

theory and policy-what Edmund Phelps
(1969, 1972) has termed "The New Microeconomics
in Inflation and Employment

Theory." The theoretical analysis in much
of this literature rests on assumptions that
also fly in the face of the facts. To cite a
few examples: all unemployment is a voluntary
activity as part of a search procedure
in which workers are continuously
equating costs and prospective benefits at
the margin; the labor supply is typically
taken to be homogeneous with perfect mobility
among labor submarkets; so-called
structural unemployment is ignored as are
the striking differences in unemployment
rates among different age, sex, ethnic, and
occupational groups; and downward wage
flexibility is generally assumed, although
some recent attempts have been made to
relax this assumption. Another related recent
development in which theory proceeds
with impeccable logic from unrealistic
assumptions to conclusions that contradict
the historical record, is the recent
work on rational expectations. (Compare
Robert J. Gordon.) And, as a final illustration
I might cite much of the recent literature
on capital theory.

II

I turn now from the first part of my title
to the second from rigor and relevance to


### ---Economics-1976-0-08.txt---
the fact that we live in a world that is continually
changing. And here I want to pose
two questions: First, to what extent does
the changing institutional environment affect
the relevance of the analytical tools
that we use and the assumptions that we
make about the determinants of individual
and group behavior? (Here, of course, I am
still raising the question of relevance.) And,
second, why do we ask so few questions
about why and how the institutional environment
has changed in the way that it
has, and what are its internal dynamics
that will lead it to change in particular
ways in the future-not only in the United
States but in other countries? A few economists
have addressed themselves to this
range of questions, notably Karl Marx and
Joseph Schumpeter. Among living economists,
three who at least raise this range
of issues are John Kenneth Galbraith,
Gunnar Myrdal, and, in the Marxist
tradition, Paul Sweezy."1

Certainly the outstanding example of
the failure of economic theory to adapt its
analytical tools to the changing institutional
environment must be the stubborn
adherence to the assumption of perfect
competition, a concept which has been described
as being "as pervasive and fundamental
as any in the whole structure of
classical and neoclassical economic theory"
(Stigler, p. 234).12 Indeed for a century or
so, economists have toiled to make more
precise the notion of a perfectly competitive
market. Over this same period, of
course, the character of actual markets has
been changing in many ways. While improvements
in transportation and communication
have tended to promote competition
in expanding markets, the growth
of large firms and the spread of industrial
concentration have made oligopoly a much
more relevant model for industrial markets
than the perfectly competitive model
which today's theorists insist on using. It
is true that sporadic efforts have been
made to develop a theory of oligopoly, and
for a while high hopes were held for what
might be learned from game theory; but
no generally accepted theory of oligopoly
has yet emerged. At the same time, the
emphasis on general equilibrium theory
has tended to turn attention away from
this egregious departure from perfect competition.
13

It is true, of course, that in the 1930's,
under the stimulus of the pioneering works
by Edward Chamberlin and Joan Robinson,
we developed a theory of monopolistic
or imperfect competition, centering on the
notion of product differentiation. And at
the same time increased attention began
to be paid to the determinants of oligopolistic
behavior. At the applied level, the
field of industrial organization was born.
But while this applied field has continued
to thrive, general micro-economic theory
and the applied work in this area have
largely parted company. General equilibrium
theory (and not only this branch of
theory) has returned to the assumption of
perfect competition. The notion of a sloping
demand curve for the individual firm
seemingly did not add much to the general
theorist's tool box, and the new mathematical
economics found it more exciting
to pick up the challenge of Walras and
Pareto and to turn to general equilibrium
analysis and to setting forth the conditions
of Pareto optimality. And for this the assumption
of perfect competition was convenient
if not essential. As William Baumol
11 There are, of course, a fair number of economists
who consider themselves to be in the American institutionalist
tradition. They are likely to belong to the
Association for Evolutionary Economics, which has its
own journal, but thus far they have had little influence
on the main trends in theoretical and applied work in
economics.

12 See also Schumpeter (1954, pp. 972 ff).
13 See, for example, the papers by Paul Joskow and
Martin Shubik in last year's Papers and Proceedings of
the American Economic Association. See also Shubik
(1970, p. 415), who bluntly declares: "There is no
oligopoly theory."


### ---Economics-1976-0-09.txt---
has noted, "The case of product differentiation
has proved particularly resistant to
general equilibrium analysis" (p. 45).14
And so, as power blocs multiplied in a
pluralistic world, as firms grew larger and
as conglomerates were added to vertical
and horizontal combinations, as advertising
expenditures mounted to influence
spending out of rising discretionary income,
as the problem of externalities became
ever more important, and as the role
of government in the functioning of markets
steadily increased, micro-economic
theory largely averted its eyes and became
ever more enamored of hypothetical systems
of general equilibrium under conditions
of perfect competition.'5

In the meantime, instructors in undergraduate
micro theory have resolutely continued
to teach their students the essentials
of the Chamberlinian partial equilibrium
analysis, with downward sloping demand
curves facing the individual firm,
and laying down the conditions for shortrun
and long-run equilibrium on an industry
basis. That much, at least, undergraduates
seem able to absorb, and some

factual counterparts can be found for the
theoretical analysis. But at the graduate
level in many universities, and the more so
the more advanced the level of instruction,
Walras and Pareto and their successors
take over, and the analysis proceeds on the
basis of the conditions associated with atomistic
competition.

A further example, reflecting another dimension
of the growth of large-scale business,
involves the conditions under which
decisions are made in the large firm.'6 Involved
here are a number of issues which
have been the subject of some theoretical
analysis and a good deal of empirical work
in the postwar years, but very little of the
results of this work has yet found its way
into main corpus of micro-economic theory.
I have in mind such questions as the relative
roles of profit maximizing and of other
criteria in the decision rules used in the
large firm, the effects of the separation of
ownership and management on these optimization
criteria, the ways in which the
bureaucratization of decision making affects
the manner in which business firms
respond to market stimuli, and the effect
of the improvements in the gathering and
processing of information that have come
not only from the revolution in data
processing but also from the development
of a more scientific approach to decision
making.'7 What has been the effect of all
this on the pricing decisions of large firms,
the manner in which they participate in
wage negotiations, or how their investment
planning responds to current and prospective
developments in product and financial
markets? And there are other examples
of the same sort. Early work not only in


### ---Economics-1976-0-10.txt---
economics but also in the other social
sciences led to the development of what is
now called "organization theory," and this
is now a field in the better business schools;
but not much of this has seeped into the
mainstream of economic theory.
Some economic theorists today are beginning
to pay serious attention to the beginnings
of a theory of information, and
increasing attention is being paid to problems
of decision making under uncertainty.
But here again too little attention tends
to be paid to the changing conditions under
which information is collected and processed,
and the manner in which institutional
arrangements affect the way in
which the future is viewed and attitudes
toward uncertainty change.

There is another and indeed startling
respect in which pure micro-economic theory
tends to ignore the changing institutional
environment. This has to do with
the steadily increasing role of government
in the functioning of markets. In neoclassical
general equilibrium theory, there
is no place for any kind of public authority.
Of course, we have the field of public
finance, which on the theoretical side and
at the micro level does borrow from neoclassical
theory; and, as Walter Heller reminded
us last year, cost-benefit analysis
and tax-incidence theory have helped
economists to develop a rationale for many
types of government decision making.
There is also a growing literature on the
economics of government decision making
in a range of problem areas-from pollution
to military spending to housing and
education. But the pure micro theorist
finds no role for a public authority in his
analysis of the determinants of general
equilibrium. (See Bent Hansen, p. 92.)
Here we encounter an important difference
between micro and macro theory.
Much of macro theory (but by no means
all) tends to be policy oriented and to have
a strong normative orientation. It is concerned
both with policy variables and with
variables that can be, directly or indirectly,
influenced by policy. While there is a good
deal of macro theory in which the possible
role of government is ignored, much of
theoretical macroeconomics does, either
explicitly or by implication, leave an important
role for government.

Although macro-economic theory does
not ignore the role of government, we can
still find plenty of examples of the failure
of macro theory to reflect the changing institutional
environment. One of the most

striking examples undoubtedly involves
what little we have in the way of a theory
of inflation. The problem is most acute
with respect to accounting for inflationary
trends since World War II.

A number of explanations are currently
circulating regarding the tendency toward
accelerating inflation in the last decade or
more. The purely monetarist one is the
simplest and makes no reference to a
changing institutional structure. It tends
to ignore the sources and nature of the
pressures, operating through government,
which lead to changes in the supply of
money. An increasing number of economists,
monetarists and Keynesians, emphasize
the existence of a natural rate of
unemployment, with the implication that
government policies to expand aggregate
demand, by pushing unemployment to or
below the natural rate, lead to accelerating
inflation. But advocates of the natural rate
hypothesis have little to say about why the
natural rate, if it exists, is what it is today,
and how and why it has changed over the
years. Much of the work in this area tends
to be done in an institutional vacuum, including
the recent work on the formation
of price expectations.

I think it is fair to say that we still lack
a general theory with a significant time
dimension of the nature of the inflationary
process and how this process is affected by
the changing institutional setting. Gunnar

Myrdal is one of those to emphasize that
"in modern society the tendency of inflation
to become cumulative and to accelerate
is rooted in a wide and complex
institutional reality" (p. 24), and to urge
a broader, institutionally oriented analysis
of underlying causes and possible remedies.
Another is Peter Wiles in a provocative
recent essay in the Economic Journal.
Among these institutional changes making
for more rapid and apparently accelerating
inflation are the postwar commitment in
all advanced countries to a high level of
employment (stronger in Europe than in
the United States), the reluctance fully to
cover increasing public expenditures by
taxation, the growing tendency to link
wage and other payments to the consumer
price index, the increasing aggressiveness
of trade unions (emphasized by Wiles)
and other organized groups of income receivers,
an apparent weakening of the

willingness of employers to resist wage demands
(which is closely related to the government'
s commitment to high employment)
, and the intensification of inflationary
expectations engendered by past
inflation. (See Myrdal, pp. 23 ff.) To all of
which we can add an international monetary
system that permitted huge dollar
outflows which became expanded monetary
reserves for other countries. This is a
familiar list. But how do these different
but related inflationary pressures interact?
Why have they become stronger? How do
we account for the particular rate of acceleration
that has occurred? Why does

the rate of acceleration seem to be different,
and because of what differences in the
institutional environment, in different
countries? And how have the significant
changes in the international system of
trade and finance affected these inflationary
trends? (See R. J. Gordon.)

I shall merely mention one other example
of the failure of economists today to take
adequate account in setting up their
models of the changing institutional environment.
This has to do with the determinants
of household behavior, with

respect to both the demand for goods and
services and the supply of labor services.
What has been the effect on household behavior,
for example, of advancing levels of
education, changes in the ways that news
is disseminated, recent trends toward urbanization
and suburbanization, or the

massive change in the impact of advertising
made possible by television?'8 To what
extent have these and other developments
made households behave more or less in
the way that economic theory assumes?
What bearing do these and other institutional
developments have on the behavior
of personal saving in recent years, in this
and other countries, and on the way that
households respond to recent and prospective
inflationary trends?

III

I turn now to my second question about
the changing institutional environment.
Why does the central body of economic
analysis show so little interest in why and
how the institutional setting for economic
behavior has changed in the past and is
likely to change in the future? The past, of
course, is the domain of the historian, but
I am not aware that the vast amount of
historical research in the past century or
more has yet given us an acceptable model
of socioeconomic development in today's
advanced economies. As I put it more than
a decade ago, "Contemporary economics
does not yet have the tools required for a
comprehensive and evolutionary theory of
economic behavior that would take appropriate
account of the main lines of institutional
change" (p. 146).19 Schumpeter
(1947) came closer in this century to providing


### ---Economics-1976-0-12.txt---
such a theory than has any other
economist in the more-or-less orthodox
tradition. Outside that tradition, we can
turn to the Marxian literature.
Here, of course, I am harking back to a
major plea of the early institutionalists.
Veblen asked long ago, in the title of one
of his papers, "Why Is Economics Not
an Evolutionary Science?," and Wesley
Mitchell urged the need for a comprehensive
theory of economic behavior that
takes the cumulative change of institutions
as its chief concern. The institutionalists
themselves did not develop such a comprehensive
and evolutionary theory. While
the classical writers did have the elements
of a dynamic system-what Baumol
once referred to as the "magnificent
dynamics" of the classical school-they
theorized on the assumption of a fixed
set of social and economic institutions. As
Schumpeter put it, "the classics reasoned
in terms of a particular historical situation
which they uncritically idealized and from
which they uncritically generalized" (1947,
p. 75).

As for contemporary economists in the
neoclassical tradition, they, like their predecessors,
seem to be afraid to ask the

really big questions about the economic
aspects of society questions which, because
they are big, must be concerned with
the changing institutional fabric. Some exception
to this generalization should be
made for the considerable effort that has
gone into the study of the underdeveloped
parts of the world. Here economists have
not been able to ignore the interaction of
the institutional environment and economic
behavior, and increasing attention
has come to be paid to the conditions necessary
for one or another kind of change
in that environment. I might add here that
I continue to be impressed by the fact that
in general economists in the advanced
countries seem to be prepared to be more
institutional in dealing with other parts of
the world than they are in studying the
particular societies in which they live and
do most of their work.20

Might the following conceptual framework
provide a basis for a more systematic
study of the dynamic interaction of economic
behavior and the institutional
framework? At the most basic level, a society
is composed of individual human
beings. These individuals are members of
households. The larger number of them
sell the factor services they control to producing
units ("firms" for short); and those
who sell labor services must physically
participate in the production process. A
flow of newly produced goods and services
results. The distribution of these goods and
services among potential claimants depends
on much more than the operation
of "impersonal market forces." It reflects a
complex of institutional arrangements,
which include, among other things, the distribution
of power among different groups
to influence particular commodity and factor
markets, both directly and through
government, how the ownership of wealth
is distributed and for whose benefit it is
used, the tax structure and network of
government regulations that emerge from
the political process, and the total and distribution
of net claims by the rest of the
world against domestic output.
Individuals not only are members of
households and suppliers of input services
to producing units (which may be governmental
as well as private), but they are also
part of a political process which, while
20 Lance Davis and Douglass North have recently set
forth a tentative and limited "theory of institutional
change" and have applied the resulting modcl to show
how a range of economic needs and opportunities have
led to new institutional arrangements in the American
economy. They are frank in setting forth some of the
limitations of their model, and Lhere is a good deal in
their approach with which I should quarrel; but their
work is clearly a step in the right direction. Incidentally,
this particular approach to economic history tends to
run counter to the recent quantitative emphasis in that
field. Clearly we need to have both types of historical
work.


### ---Economics-1976-0-13.txt---
partly local and regional, culminates in the
powers of a national government.
Thus we begin with the households and
producing units of conventional economic
theory but immediately add government
as a third basic unit. Households, firms,
and government interact within a set of
evolving economic institutions. These economic
institutions include a hierarchy of
markets for current output and for the
services of labor, capital, and natural resources,
and an array of supporting institutions-
from commercial banks to labor
mediators to government agencies-that
also make a contribution to total output.
Households and firms interact not only in
response to the standard market stimuli
but also by organizing pressure groups to
influence both government and particular
markets.

These pressure groups-not only labor
unions and trade associations but a wide
variety of other formal and informal
groups-operate within and are conditioned
by an evolving set of political and
legal institutions that lay down the ground
rules as to the way households, firms, and
government interact with each other. A
major aim of the pressure groups is to influence
government and markets not only
directly but also by altering legal and political
institutional arrangements. And as a
result of these pressures, the conditions
under which households and firms carry
out their economic functions change with
the passage of time-as do the ways in
which households and firms, through a
variety of forms of organization, seek to
change these conditions still further in
favor of their particular interests.21
We may speak of households, firms, and
government as the primary economic
agents which carry on their activities within
the framework of a set of evolving economic
institutions. But these agents and
economic institutions also interact with an
external environment which can be classified
in a variety of ways. One simple classification
might be: (1) the framework of
legal and political institutions, to which I
have already referred; (2) the complex of
social institutions that make up what may
loosely be referred to as the social environment;
(3) the evolving body of scientific
and technical knowledge (and the institutions
through which such knowledge is developed
and transmitted); (4) the physical
environment; and (5) the complex of political
and economic arrangements that tie
a nation to the rest of the world.
Against this background, let us now
come back to my final question about the
evolving institutional environment, which
bluntly put was: How did we get to where
we are, and where are we going? Or, if you
will, what is the future of capitalism and
of the kind of market economy to which we
are accustomed and which is changing before
our eyes? Lacking a dynamic, politicoeconomic,
and institutionally oriented

miodel, the neoclassical economist averts
his eyes-or possibly, and reluctantly, refers
the questioner to the still growing
Marxist literature. Has not the time come
for "orthodox" economists-both defenders
and critics of neoclassical theory-to repair
this glaring deficiency? Let us borrow
what seems appropriate from Marx and
his followers as well as from others, although
what Marx had to say fitted nineteenth
century England much better than
it does late twentieth century Western
Europe or the United States. But at least
let us try to construct a model of the sort
I suggest that will have something to say
about the evolution and future of the kind
of economy and society in which we live.


### ---Economics-1976-0-14.txt---
Sketchy as it is, and it is certainly
sketchy, I think my suggested conceptual
framework or something similar offers a
possible starting point. And there are
many intermediate questions to be raised
along the way. We have been witnessing a
significant extension of government control
of the market mechanism in all of the advanced
economies, more so in some than in
others. This intervention ranges from conventional
forms of regulation of particular
industries, to sporadic attempts to impose
one or another kind of incomes policy, to
large-scale programs to redistribute incomes,
to widening experiments in worker
participation, to outright nationalization
of particular firms or industries. What
combinations of pressures have caused this
extension of government intervention;
what forces will extend it further; what
forms will such intervention take; and
what are likely to be the effects on the
allocation of resources, the distribution of
income and wealth, and the rates of inflation
and of growth in total output-not to
mention the possible effects on the various
dimensions of the institutional environment,
including the institution of private
property?

There are many other elements, besides
the few mentioned here, that would have
to be incorporated into a full-fledged, institutionally
oriented theory of economic

development for the advanced economies
of the nonsocialist world. And we need
also to fit in the underdeveloped countries.
Here clearly we have to be political economists,
and not just economists in the neoclassical
sense. We are currently witnessing
powerful political forces at work aimed at
improving the terms of trade of the third
world with the advanced countries. What
will determine the eventual outcome? Mention
of the third world raises a host of other
issues, political as well as economic. These
include the seemingly inexorable advance
of socialism in many of these countries ;22
the effect of autocratic forms of government
on the pace of economic growth, the
allocation of resources, and the distribution
of income; and the ability of these
countries to deal with the population
growth resulting from high birth rates and
declining death rates.

And finally, to repeat, there is for economists
the basic question to which not only
Marx and his followers but also Schumpeter
addressed themselves: What is the future
of capitalism in the advanced economies,
given the growing size and bureaucratization
of business firms, the increasing
strength of organized pressure groups, and
the momentum from the increasing government
intervention that has already occurred?
It seems to me that capitalism as
we know it in this coulntry or even in
Western Europe has little future in the
third world. What is its future in the advanced
economies?

IV

And so, on this somber note, I end. I
have scolded economists for what I think
are the sins that too many of them commit,
and I have tried to point the way to at
least partial redemption. This road to
salvation will not be an easy one for those
who have been seduced by the siren of
mathematical elegance or those who all too
often seek to test unrealistic models without
much regard for the quality or relevance
of the data they feed into their equations.
But let us all continue to worship at
the altar of science. I ask only that our
credo be: "relevance with as much rigor as
possible," and not "rigor regardless of
relevance." And let us not be afraid to ask
-and to try to answer the really big
questions.

22 Which leads at least this observer to wonder how
compatible are democracy and capitalism in an underdeveloped
country whose aspirations are rising much
faster than its means to satisfy them.

 ## Economics-1977-0


### ---Economics-1977-0-03.txt---
In recent years and especially since the onset
of the current depression, the economics profession
and the lay public have heard a great deal
about the sharp conflict between "monetarists
and Keynesians" or between "monetarists and
fiscalists.". The difference between the two
"schools" is generally held to center on whether
the money supply or fiscal variables are the
major determinants of aggregate economic activity,
and hence the most appropriate tool of
stabilization policies.

My central theme is that this view is quite far
from the truth, and that the issues involved are of
far greater practical import. There are in reality
no serious analytical disagreements between
leading monetarists and leading nonmonetarists.
Milton Friedman was once quoted as saying,
"We are all Keynesians, now," and I am quite
prepared to reciprocate that "we are all monetarists'
'-if by morietarism is meant assigning to
the stock of money a major role in determining
output and prices. Indeed, the list of those who
have long been monetarists in this sense is quite
extensive, including among other John Maynard
Keynes as well as myself, as is attested by
my 1944 and 1963 articles.

In reality the distinguishing feature of the
monetarist school and the real issues of disagreement
with nonmonetarists is not monetarism, but
rather the role that should probably be assigned
to stabilization policies. Nonmonetarists accept
what I regard to be the fundamental practical
message of The General Theory: that a private
enterprise economy using an intangible money
needs to be stabilized, can be stabilized, and
therefore should be stabilized by appropriate
monetary and fiscal policies. Monetarists by
contrast take the view that there is no serious
need to stabilize the economy; that even if there
were a need, it could not be done, for stabilization
policies would be more likely to increase
than to decrease instability; and, at least some
monetarists would, I believe, go so far as to hold
that, even in the unlikely event that stabilization
policies could on balance prove beneficial, the
government should not be trusted with the necessary
power.

What has led me to address this controversy
is the recent spread of monetarism, both in a
simplistic, superficial form and in the form of
growing influence on the practical conduct of
economic policy, which influence, I shall argue
presently, has played at least some role in the
economic upheavals of the last three years.
In what follows then, I propose first to review
the main arguments bearing on the need for
stabilization policies, that is, on the likely extent
of instability in the absence of such policies, and
then to examine the issue of the supposed destabilizing
effect of pursuing stabilization policies.
My main concern will be with instability generated
by the traditional type of disturbances-demand
shocks. But before I am through, I will
give some consideration to the difficult problems
raised by the newer type of disturbance-supply
shocks.

I. The Keynesian Case for Stabilization Policies
A. The General Theory

Keynes' novel conclusion about the need for


### ---Economics-1977-0-04.txt---
stabilization policies, as was brought out by the
early interpreters of The General Theory (for
example, John Hicks, the author, 1944), resulted
from the interaction of a basic contribution
to traditional monetary theory-liquidity
preference-and an unorthodox hypothesis
about the working of the labor market-complete
downward rigidity of wages.

Because of liquidity preference, a change in
aggregate demand, which may be broadly defined
as any event that results in a change in the
market clearing or equilibrium rate of interest,
will produce a corresponding change in the real
demand for money or velocity of circulation, and
hence in the real stock of money needed at full
employment. As long as wages are perfectly
flexible, even with a constant nominal supply,
full employment could and would be maintained
by a change of wages and prices as needed to
produce the required change in the real money
supply-though even in this case, stability of the
price level would require a countercyclical monetary
policy. But, under the Keynesian wage
assumption the classical adjustment through
prices can occur only in the case of an increased
demand. In the case of a decline, instead, wage
rigidity prevents the necessary increase in the
real money supply and the concomitant required
fall in interest rates. Hence, if the nominal
money supply is constant, the initial equilibrium
must give way to a new stable one, characterized
by lower output and by an involuntary reduction
in employment, so labeled because it does not
result from a shift in notional demand and supply
schedules in terms of real wages, but only from
an insufficient real money supply. The nature of
this equilibrium is elegantly captured by the
Hicksian IS-LM paradigm, which to our generation
of economists has become almost as familiar
as the demand-supply paradigm was to
earlier ones.

This analysis implied that a fixed money supply
far from insuring approximate stability of
prices and output, as held by the traditional
view, would result in a rather unstable economy,
alternating between periods of protracted unemployment
and stagnation, and bursts of inflation.
The extent of downward instability would depend
in part on the size of the exogenous shocks
to demand and in part on the strength of what
may be called the Hicksian mechanism. By this
I mean the extent to which a shift in IS, through
its interaction with LM, results in some decline
in interest rates and thus in a change in income
which is smaller than the original shift. The stabilizing
power of this mechanism is controlled
by various parameters of the system. In particular,
the economy will be more unstable
the greater the interest elasticity of demand for
money, and the smaller the interest responsiveness
of aggregate demand. Finally, a large
multiplier is also destabilizing in that it implies
a larger shift in IS for a given shock.
However, the instability could be readily
counteracted by appropriate stabilization policies.
Monetary policy could change the nominal
supply of money so as to accommodate the
change in real demand resulting from shocks in
aggregate demand. Fiscal policy, through expenditure
and taxes, could offset these shocks,
making full employment consistent with the
initial nominal money stock. In general, both
monetary and fiscal policies could be used in
combination. But because of a perceived uncertainty
in the response of demand to changes in
interest rates, and because changes in interest
rates through monetary policy could meet difficulties
and substantial delays related to expectations
(so-called liquidity traps), fiscal policy
was regarded as having some advantages.
B. The Early Keynesians

The early disciples of the new Keynesian
gospel, still haunted by memories of the Great
Depression, frequently tended to outdo Keynes'
pessimism about potential instability. Concern
with liquidity traps fostered the view that the demand
for money was highly interest elastic;
failure to distinguish between the short- and
long-run marginal propensity to save led to overestimating
the long-run saving rate, thereby
fostering concern with stagnation, and to underestimating
the short-run propensity, thereby
exaggerating the short-run multiplier. Interest


### ---Economics-1977-0-05.txt---
rates were supposed to affect, at best, the demand
for long-lived fixed investments, and the
interest elasticity was deemed to be low. Thus,
shocks were believed to produce a large response.
Finally, investment demand was seen as
capriciously controlled by "animal spirits,"
thus providing an important source of shocks.
All this justified calling for very active stabilization
policies. Furthermore, since the very
circumstances which produce a large response to
demand shocks also produce a large response to
fiscal and a small response to monetary actions,
there was a tendency to focus on fiscal policy as
the main tool to keep the economy at near full
employment.

C. The Phillips Curve

In the two decades following The General
Theory, there were a number of developments of
the Keynesian system including dynamization of
the model, the stress on taxes versus expenditures
and the balanced budget multiplier, and the
first attempts at estimating the critical parameters
through econometric techniques and models.
But for present purposes, the most important
one was the uncovering of a "stable" statistical
relation between the rate of change of wages and
the rate of unemployment, which has since come
to be known as the Phillips curve. This relation,
and its generalization by Richard Lipsey to allow
for the effect of recent inflation, won wide acceptance
even before an analytical underpinning
could be provided for it, in part because it could
account for the "puzzling" experience of 1954
and 1958, when wages kept rising despite the
substantial rise in unemployment. It also served
to dispose of the rather sterile "cost push"-
"demand pull" controversy.

In the following years, a good deal of attention
went into developing theoretical foundations for
the Phillips curve, in particular along the lines of
search models (for example, Edmund Phelps et
al.). This approach served to shed a new light on
the nature of unemployment by tracing it in the
first place to labor turnover and search time
rather than to lack of jobs as such: in a sense
unemployment is all frictional-at least in developed
countries. At the same time it clarified
how the availability of more jobs tends to reduce
unemployment by increasing vacancies and thus
reducing search time.

Acceptance of the Phillips curve relation
implied some significant changes in the Keynesian
framework which partly escaped notice until
the subsequent monetarists' attacks. Since the
rate of change of wages decreased smoothly with
the rate of unemployment, there was no longer a
unique Full Employment but rather a whole
family of possible equilibrium rates, each associated
with a different rate of inflation (and requiring,
presumably, a different long-run
growth of money). It also impaired the notion of
a stable underemployment equilibrium. A fall in
demand could still cause an initial rise in unemployment
but this rise, by reducing the growth of
wages, would eventually raise the real money
supply, tending to return unemployment to the
equilibrium rate consistent with the given longrun
growth of money.

But at the practical level it did not lessen the
case for counteracting lasting demand disturbances
through stabilization policies rather than
by relying on the slow process of wage adjustment
to do the job, at the cost of protracted unemployment
and instability of prices. Indeed,
the realm of stabilization policies appeared to expand
in the sense that the stabilization authority
had the power of choosing the unemployment
rate around which employment was to be stabilized,
though it then had to accept the associated
inflation. Finally, the dependence of wage
changes also on past inflation forced recognition
of a distinction between the short- and the longrun
Phillips curve, the latter exhibiting the longrun
equilibrium rate of inflation implied by a
maintained unemployment rate. The fact that the
long-run tradeoff between unemployment and
inflation was necessarily less favorable than the
short-run one, opened up new vistas of "enjoyit-
now, pay-later" policies, and even resulted in
an entertaining literature on the political business
cycle and how to stay in the saddle by riding
the Phillips curve (see for example, Ray Fair,
William Nordhaus).


### ---Economics-1977-0-06.txt---
II. The Monetarists' Attack

A. The Stabilizing Power of the
Hicksian Mechanism

The monetarists' attack on Keynesianism was
directed from the very beginning not at the
Keynesian framework as such, but at whether it
really implied a need for stabilization. It rested
on a radically different empirical assessment of
the value of the parameters controlling the stabilizing
power of the Hicksian mechanism and of
the magnitude and duration of response to
shocks, given a stable money supply. And this
different assessment in turn was felt to justify a
radical downgrading of the practical relevance
of the Keynesian framework as distinguished
from its analytical validity.

Liquidity preference was a fine contribution
to monetary theory but in practice the responsiveness
of the demand for money, and hence of
velocity, to interest rates, far from being unmanageably
large, was so small that according to a
well-known paper by Milton Friedman (1969),
it could not even be detected empirically. On the
other hand, the effect of interest rates on aggregate
demand was large and by no means limited
to the traditional fixed investments but quite
pervasive. The difficulty of detecting it empirically
resulted from focusing on a narrow range
of measured market rates and from the fact that
while the aggregate could be counted on to respond,
the response of individual components
might not be stable. Finally, Friedman's celebrated
contribution to the theory of the consumption
function (1957) (and my own work on the
life cycle hypothesis with Richard Brumberg and
others, reviewed by the author, 1975) implied a
very high short-run marginal propensity to save
in response to transient disturbances to income
and hence a small short-run multiplier.
All this justified the conclusion that (i) though
demand shocks might qualitatively work along
the lines described by Keynes, quantitatively the
Hicks mechanism is so strong that their impact
would be small and transient, provided the
stock of money was kept on a steady growth
path; (ii) fiscal policy actions, like other demand
shocks, would have minor and transitory effects
on demand, while changes in money would
produce large and permanent effects on money
income; and, therefore, (iii) the observed instability
of the economy, which was anyway
proving moderate as the postwar period unfolded,
was most likely the result of the unstable
growth of money, be it due to misguided endeavors
to stabilize income or to the pursuit of
other targets, which were either irrelevant or, in
the case of balance of payments goals, should
have been made irrelevant by abandoning fixed
exchanges.

B. The Demise of Wage Rigidity and the
Vertical Phillips Curve

But the most serious challenge came in
Friedman's 1968 Presidential Address, building
on ideas independently put forth also by Phelps
(1968). Its basic message was that, despite appearances,
wages were in reality perfectly flexible
and there was accordingly no involuntary
unemployment. The evidence to the contrary,
including the Phillips curve, was but a statistical
illusion resulting from failure to differentiate between
price changes and unexpected price
changes.

Friedman starts out by reviving the Keynesian
notion that, at any point of time, there exists a
unique full-employment rate which he labels the
"'natural rate." An unanticipated fall in demand
in Friedman's competitive world leads firms to
reduce prices and also output and employment
along the short-run marginal cost curve unless
the nominal wage declines together with prices.
But workers, failing to judge correctly the current
and prospective fall in prices, misinterpret
the reduction of nominal wages as a cut in real
wages. Hence, assuming a positively sloped
supply function, they reduce the supply of labor.
As a result, the effective real wage rises to the
point where the resulting decline in the demand
for labor matches the reduced supply. Thus, output
falls not because of the decline in demand,
but because of the entirely voluntary reduction in
the supply of labor, in response to erroneous
perceptions. Furthermore, the fall in employment


### ---Economics-1977-0-07.txt---
can only be temporary, as expectations
must soon catch up with the facts, at least in the
absence of new shocks. The very same mechanism
works in the case of an increase in demand,
so that the responsiveness of wages and
prices is the same on either side of the natural
rate.

The upshot is that Friedman's model also
implies a Phillips-type relation between inflation,
employment or unemployment, and past
inflation,-provided the latter variable is interpreted
as a reasonable proxy for expected inflation.
But it turns the standard explanation on its
head: instead of (excess) employment causing
inflation, it is (the unexpected component of)
the rate of inflation that causes excess
employment.

One very basic implication of Friedman's
model is that the coefficient of price expectations
should be precisely unity. This specification
implies that whatever the shape of the short-run
Phillips curve a shape determined by the relation
between expected and actual price changes,
and by the elasticity of labor supply with respect
to the perceived real wage the long-run curve
must be vertical.

Friedman's novel twist provided a fresh prop
for the claim that stabilization policies are not
really needed, for, with wages flexible, except
possibly for transient distortions, the Hicksian
mechanism receives powerful reinforcement
from changes in the real money supply. Similarly,
the fact that full employment was a razor
edge provided new support for the claim that
stabilization policies were bound to prove destabilizing.


C. The Macro Rational Expectations Revolution
But the death blow to the already badly battered
Keynesian position was to come only
shortly thereafter by incorporating into Friedman'
s model the so-called rational expectation
hypothesis, or REH. Put very roughly, this hypothesis,
originally due to John Muth, states that
rational economic agents will endeavor to form
expectations of relevant future variables by
making the most efficient use of all information
provided by past history. It is a fundamental and
fruitful contribution that has already found many
important applications, for example, in connection
with speculative markets, and as a basis for
some thoughtful criticism by Robert Lucas
( 1976) of certain features of econometric models.
What I am concerned with here is only its
application to macro-economics, or MREH,
associated with such authors as Lucas (1972),
Thomas Sargent (1976), and Sargent and Neil
Wallace (1976).

The basic ingredient of MREH is the postulate
that the workers of Friedman's model hold rational
expectations, which turns out to have a number
of remarkable implications: (i) errors of
price expectations, which are the only source of
departure from the natural state, cannot be
avoided but they can only be short-lived and
random. In particular, there cannot be persistent
unemployment above the natural rate for this
would imply high serial correlation between the
successive errors of expectation, which is inconsistent
with rational expectations; (ii) any attempts
to stabilize the economy by means of
stated monetary or fiscal rules are bound to be
totally ineffective because their effect will be
fully discounted in rational expectations; (iii)
nor can the government successfully pursue ad
hoc measures to offset shocks. The private sector
is already taking care of any anticipated
shock; therefore government policy could conceivably
help only if the government information
was better than that of the public, which is
impossible, by the very definition of rational
expectations. Under these conditions, ad hoc
stabilization policies are most likely to produce
instead further destabilizing shocks.
These are clearly remarkable conclusions, and
a major rediscovery for it had all been said 40
years ago by Keynes in a well-known passage of
The General Theory:

If, indeed, labour were always in a position
to take action (and were to do so),
whenever there was less than full employment,
to reduce its money demands by
concerted action to whatever point was
required to make money so abundant relatively


### ---Economics-1977-0-08.txt---
to the wage-unit that the rate of
interest would fall to a level compatible
with full employment, we should, in effect,
have monetary management by the
Trade Unions, aimed at full employment,
instead of by the banking systems.
[p. 2671

The only novelty is that MREH replaces Keynes'
opening "if" with a "since."

If one accepts this little amendment, the case
against stabilization policies is complete. The
economy is inherently pretty stable-except
possibly for the effect of government messing
around. And to the extent that there is a small
residual instability, it is beyond the power of
human beings, let alone the government, to
alleviate it.

III. How Valid Is the Monetarist Case?
A. The Monetarist Model of Wage
Price Behavior

In setting out the counterattack it is convenient
to start with the monetarists' model of price and
wage behavior. Here one must distinguish between
the model as such and a specific implication
of that model, namely that the long-run
Phillips curve is vertical, or, in substance, that,
in the long run, money is neutral. That conclusion,
by now, does not meet serious objection
from nonmonetarists, at least as a first
approximation.

But the proposition that other things equal,
and given time enough, the economy will eventually
adjust to any indefinitely maintained stock
of money, or nth derivative thereof, can be derived
from a variety of models and, in any event,
is of very little practical relevance, as I will argue
below. What is unacceptable, because inconsistent
with both micro and macro evidence, is
the specific monetarist model set out above and
its implication that all unemployment is a voluntary,
fleeting response to transitory misperceptions.


One may usefully begin with a criticism of the
Macro Rational Expectations model and why
Keynes' "if" should not be replaced by
"since." At the logical level, Benjamin Friedman
has called attention to the omission from
MREH of an explicit learning model, and has
suggested that, as a result, it can only be interpreted
as a description not of short-run but of
long-run equilibrium in which no agent would
wish to recontract. But then the implications of
MREH are clearly far from startling, and their
policy relevance is almost nil. At the institutional
level, Stanley Fischer has shown that the
mere recognition of long-term contracts is sufficient
to generate wage rigidity and a substantial
scope for stabilization policies. But the most
glaring flaw of MREH is its inconsistency with
the evidence: if it were valid, deviations of unemployment
from the natural rate would be
small and transitory in which case The General
Theory would not have been written and
neither would this paper. Sargent (1976) has
attempted to remedy this fatal flaw by hypothesizing
that the persistent and large fluctuations
in unemployment reflect merely corresponding
swings in the natural rate itself. In other words,
what happened to the United States in the 1930's
was a severe attack of contagious laziness! I can
only say that, despite Sargent's ingenuity,
neither I nor, I expect, most others at least of
the nonmonetarists' persuasion are quite ready
yet to turn over the field of economic fluctuations
to the social psychologist!

Equally serious objections apply to Friedman'
s modeling of the commodity market as a
perfectly competitive one-so that the real wage
rate is continuously equated to the short-run
marginal product of labor-and to his treatment
of labor as a homogenous commodity traded in
an auction market, so that, at the going wage,
there never is any excess demand by firms or
excess supply by workers. The inadequacies of
this model as a useful formalization of present
day Western economies are so numerous that
only a few of the major ones can be mentioned
here.

Friedman's view of unemployment as a voluntary
reduction in labor supply could at best
provide an explanation of variations in labor
force-and then only under the questionable
assumption that the supply function has a significantly


### ---Economics-1977-0-09.txt---
positive slope-but cannot readily
account for changes in unemployment. Furthermore,
it cannot be reconciled with the wellknown
fact that rising unemployment is
accompanied by a fall, not by a rise in quits, nor
with the role played by temporary layoffs to
which Martin Feldstein has recently called
attention. Again, his competitive model of
the commodity market, accepted also in The
General Theorv, implies that changes in real
wages. adjusted for long-run productivity trend,
should be significantly negatively correlated
with cyclical changes in employment and output
and with changes in money wages. But as early
as 1938, John Dunlop showed that this conclusion
was rejected by some eighty years of British
experience and his results have received some
support in more recent tests of Ronald Bodkin
for the United States and Canada. Similar tests
of my own, using quarterly data, provide striking
confirmation that for the last two decades
from the end of the Korean War until 1973, the
association of trend adjusted real compensations
of the private nonfarm sector with either
employment or the change in nominal compensation
is prevailingly positive and very significantly
so.'

This evidence can, instead, be accounted for
by the oligopolistic pricing model-according
to which price is determined by long-run minimum
average cost up to a mark-up reflecting
entry-preventing considerations (see the author,
1958) coupled with some lags in the adjustment
of prices to costs. This model implies that
firms respond to a change in demand by endeavoring
to adjust output and employment, without
significant changes in prices relative to wages;
and the resulting changes in available jobs have
their initial impact not on wages but rather on
unemployment by way of layoffs and recalls and
through changes in the level of vacancies, and
hence on the length of average search time.
If, in the process, vacancies rise above a critical
level, or "natural rate," firms will endeavor
to reduce them by outbidding each other, thereby
raising the rate of change of wages. Thus, as
long as jobs and vacancies remain above, and
unemployment remains below, some critical
level which might be labeled the "noninflationary
rate" (see the author and Lucas Papademos,
1975), wages and prices will tend to accelerate.
If, on the other hand, jobs fall below, and unemployment
rises above, the noninflationary rate,
firms finding that vacancies are less than optimal
-in the limit the unemployed queuing outside
the gate will fill them instantly will have an
incentive to reduce their relative wage offer. But
in this case, in which too much labor is looking
for too few jobs, the trend toward a sustained
decline in the rate of growth of wages is likely
to be even weaker than the corresponding acceleration
when too many jobs are bidding for too
few people. The main reason is the nonhomogeneity
of labor. By far the largest and more
valuable source of labor supply to a firm consists
of those already employed who are not readily
interchangeable with the unemployed and, in
contrast with them, are concerned with protecting
their earnings and not with reestablishing
full employment. For these reasons, and because
the first to quit are likely to be the best workers, a
reduction of the labor force can, within limits, be
accomplished more economically, not by reducing
wages to generate enough quits, but by
firing or, when possible, by layoffs which insure
access to a trained labor force when demand
recovers. More generally, the inducement to
'Thus, in a logarithmic regression of private nonfarm
hourly compensation deflated by the private nonfarimi
deflator on output per man-hour, time, and private nonfarm
employment, after correcting for first-order serial correlation,
the latter variable has a coefficient of . 17 and a t-ratio
of 5. Similar though less significant results were found for
manufacturing. If employment is replaced by the change in
nominal compensation, its coefficient is .40 with a t-ratio of
6.5. Finally, if the change in compensation is replaced by
the change in price, despite the negative bias from error
of measurement of price, the coefficient of this variable is
only - .09 with an entirely insignificant t-ratio of .7. The
period after 1 973 has been omitted from the tests as irrelevant
for our purposes, since the inflation was driven primnarily by
an exogenous price shock rather than by excess demand. As a
result of the shock, prices, and to some extent wages, rose
rapidly while employment and real wages fell. Thus, the
addition of the last two years tends to increase spuriously the
positive association between real wages and employment,
and to decrease that between real wages and the change in
inominal wages or prices.


### ---Economics-1977-0-10.txt---
reduce relative wages to eliminate the excess
supply is moderated by the effect that such a
reduction would have on quits and costly turnover,
even when the resulting vacancies can be
readily filled from the ranks of the unemployed.
Equally relevant are the consequences in terms
of loss of morale and good will, in part for reasons
which have been elaborated by the literature
on implicit contracts (see Robert Gordon).
Thus, while there will be some tendency for the
rate of change of wages to fall, the more so the
larger the unemployment-at least in an economy
like the United States where there are no
overpowering centralized unions-that tendency
is severely damped.

And whether, given an unemployment rate
significantly and persistently above the noninflationary
level, the rate of change of wages would,
eventually, tend to turn negative and decline
without bound or whether it would tend to an
asymptote is a question that I doubt the empirical
evidence will ever answer. The one experiment
we have had the Great Depression suggests
the answer is negative, and while I admit that,
for a variety of reasons, that evidence is muddied,
I hope that we will never have the opportunity
for a second, clean experiment.
In any event, what is really important for
practical purposes is not the long-run equilibrium
relation as such, but the speed with which it
is approached. Both the model sketched out and
the empirical evidence suggest that the process
of acceleration or deceleration of wages when
unemployment differs from the noninflationary
rate will have more nearly the character of a
crawl than of a gallop. It will suffice to recall in
this connection that there was excess demand
pressure in the United States at least from 1965
to mid- 1970, and during that period the growth
of inflation was from some 1.5 to only about 5.5
percent per year. And the response to the excess
supply pressure from mid-1970 to early 1973,
and from late 1974 to date was equally sluggish.
B. The Power of Self-Stabilizing Mechanisms:
The Evidence from Econometric Models
There remains to consider the monetarists'
initial criticism of Keynesianism, to wit, that
even without high wage flexibility, the system's
response to demand shocks is small and shortlived,
thanks to the power of the Hicksian mechanism.
Here it must be acknowledged that every
one of the monetarists' criticisms of early,
simpleminded Keynesianism has proved in
considerable measure correct.

With regard to the interest elasticity of demand
for money, post-Keynesian developments
in the theory of money, and in particular, the
theoretical contributions of William Baumol,
James Tobin, Merton Miller, and Daniel Orr,
point to a modest value of around one-half to
one-third, and empirical studies (see for example,
Stephen Goldfeld) are largely consistent
with this prediction (at least until 1975!). Similarly,
the dependence of consumption on longrun,
or life cycle, income and on wealth,
together with the high marginal tax rates of the
postwar period, especially the corporate tax,
and leakages through imports, lead to a rather
low estimate of the multiplier.
Last but not least, both theoretical and empirical
work, reflected in part in econometric models,
have largely vindicated the monetarist
contention that interest effects on demand are
pervasive and substantial. Thus, in the construction
and estimation of the MIT-Penn-Social
Science Research Council (MPS) econometric
model of the United States, we found evidence
of effects, at least modest, on nearly every component
of aggregate demand. One response to
money supply changes that is especially important
in the MPS, if somewhat controversial, is
via interest rates on the market value of all assets
and thus on consumption.

There is, therefore, substantial agreement that
in the United States the Hicksian mechanism is
fairly effective in limiting the effect of shocks,
and that the response of wages and prices to
excess demand or supply will also work gradually
toward eliminating largely, if not totally,
any effect on employment. But in the view of
nonmonetarists, the evidence overwhelmingly
supports the conclusion that the interim response
is still of significant magnitude and of considerable
duration, basically because the wheels of
the offsetting mechanism grind slowly. To be
sure, the first link of the mechanism, the rise in
short-term rates, gets promptly into play and


### ---Economics-1977-0-11.txt---
heftily, given the low money demand elasticity;
but most expenditures depend on long-term
rates, which generally respond but gradually,
and the demand response is generally also gradual.
Furthermore, while this response is building
up, multiplier and accelerator mechanisms work
toward amplifying the shock. Finally, the classical
mechanism the change in real money
supply through prices has an even longer lag
because of the sluggish response of wages to
excess demand.

These interferences are supported by simulations
with econometric models like the MPS.
Isolating, first, the working of the Hicksian
mechanism by holding prices constant, we find
that a 1 percent demand shock, say a rise in real
exports, produces an impact effect on aggregate
output which is barely more than 1 percent, rises
to a peak of only about 2 percent a year later, and
then declines slowly toward a level somewhat
over 1.5 percent.

Taking into account the wage price mechanism
hardly changes the picture for the first
year because of its inertia. Thereafter, however,
it becomes increasingly effective so that a year
later the real response is back at the impact level,
and by the end of the third year the shock has
been fully offset (thereafter output oscillates
around zero in a damped fashion). Money income,
on the other hand, reaches a peak of over
2.5, and then only by the middle of the second
year. It declines thereafter, and tends eventually
to oscillate around a positive value because normally,
a demand shock requires eventually a
change in interest rates and hence in velocity
and money income.

These results, which are broadly confirmed by
other econometric models, certainly do not support
the view of a highly unstable economy in
which fiscal policy has powerful and everlasting
effects. But neither do they support the monetarist
view of a highly stable economy in which
shocks hardly make a ripple and the effects of
fiscal policy are puny and fast vanishing.
C. The Monetarist Evidence and the
St. Louis Quandary

Monetarists, however, have generally been
inclined to question this evidence. They countered
at first with tests bearing on the stability of
velocity and the insignificance of the multiplier,
which, however, as indicated in my criticism
with Albert Ando (1965), must be regarded as
close to worthless. More recently, several authors
at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
(Leonall Andersen, Keith Carlson, Jerry Lee
Jordan) have suggested that instead of deriving
multipliers from the analytical or numerical
solution of an econometric model involving a
large number of equations, any one of which
may be questioned, they should be estimated
directly through "reduced form" equations by
relating the change in income to current and
lagged changes in some appropriate measure of
the money supply and of fiscal impulses.
The results of the original test, using the
current and but four lagged values of M1 and of
high Employment Federal Expenditure as measures
of monetary and fiscal impulses, turned out
to be such as to fill a monetarist's heart with joy.
The contribution of money, not only current but
also lagged, was large and the coefficients implied
a not unreasonable effect of the order of
magnitude of the velocity of circulation, though
somewhat higher. On the other hand, the estimated
coefficients of the fiscal variables seemed
to support fully the monetarists' claim that their
impact was both small and fleeting: the effect
peaked in but two quarters and was only around
one, and disappeared totally by the fourth quarter
following the change.

These results were immediately attacked on
the ground that the authors had used the wrong
measure of monetary and fiscal actions, and it
was shown that the outcome was somewhat
sensitive to alternative measures; however, the
basic nature of the results did not change, at least
qualitatively. In particular, the outcome does not
differ materially, at least for the original period
up to 1969, if one replaces high employment outlays
with a variable that might be deemed more
suitable, like government expenditure on goods
and services, plus exports.

These results must be acknowledged as disturbing
for nonmonetarists, for there is little
question that movements in government purchases
and exports are a major source of demand
disturbances; if econometric model estimates of


### ---Economics-1977-0-12.txt---
the response to demand disturbances are roughly
valid, how can they be so grossly inconsistent
with the reduced form estimates?
Attempts at reconciling the two have taken
several directions, which are reviewed in an
article coauthored with Ando (1976). Our main
conclusion, based on simulation techniques, is
that when income is subject to substantial shocks
from many sources other than monetary and
fiscal, so that these variables account for only a
moderate portion of the variations in income (in
the United States, it has been of the order of onehalf
to two-thirds), then the St. Louis reduced
form method yields highly unstable and unreliable
estimates of the true structure of the system
generating the data.

The crucial role of unreliability and instability
has since been confirmed in more recent work of
Daniel O'Neill in his forthcoming thesis. He
shows in the first place that different methods
of estimation yield widely different estimates,
including many which clearly overstate the
expenditure and understate the money multipliers.
He further points out that, given the
unreliability of the estimates resulting from
multicollinearity and large residual variance,
the relevant question to ask is not whether
these estimates differ from those obtained by
structural estimation, but whether the difference
is statistically significant; that is, larger than
could be reasonably accounted for by sampling
fluctuations.

I have carried out this standard statistical test
using as true response coefficients those generated
by the MPS model quoted earlier.2 I find
that, at least when the test is based on the largest
possible sample-the entire post-Korean period
up to the last two very disturbed years-the
difference is totally insignificant when estimation
is in level form (F is less than one) and is
still not significant at the 5 percent level, when in
first differences.

This test resolves the puzzle by showing that
there really is no puzzle: the two alternative estimates
of the expenditure multipliers are not
inconsistent, given the margin of error of the
estimates. It implies that one should accept
whichever of the two estimates is produced by a
more reliable and stable method, and is generally
more sensible. To me, those criteria call, without
question, for adopting the econometric
model estimates. But should there be still some
lingering doubt about this choice, I am happy to
be able to report the results of one final test
which I believe should dispose of the reduced
form estimates-at least for a while. Suppose
the St. Louis estimates of the expenditure multiplier
are closer to God's truth than the estimates
derived through econometric models. Then it
should be the case that if one uses their coefficients
to forecast income beyond the period of
fit, these forecasts should be appreciably better
than those obtained from a forecasting equation
in which the coefficients of the expenditure variable
are set equal to those obtained from econometric
models.

I have carried out this test, comparing a reduced
form equation fitted to the period originally
used at St. Louis, terminating in 1969 (but
reestimated with the lastest revised data) with an
equation in which the coefficients of government
expenditure plus exports were constrained to be
those estimated from the MPS, used in the above
F-test. The results are clear cut: the errors using
the reduced form coefficient are not smaller but
on the average substantially larger than those
using MPS multipliers. For the first four years,
terminating at the end of 1973, the St. Louis
equation produces errors which are distinctly
larger in eight quarters, and smaller in but three,
and its squared error is one-third larger. For the
last two years of turmoil, both equations perform
miserably, though even here the MPS coefficients
perform just a bit better. I have repeated
this test with equations estimated through the
first half of the postwar period, and the results
are, if anything, even more one-sided.
The moral of the story is pretty clear. First,


### ---Economics-1977-0-13.txt---
reduced form equations relying on just two exogenous
variables are very unreliable for the purpose
of estimating structure, nor are they
particularly accurate for forecasting, though per
dollar of research expenditure they are surprisingly
good. Second, if the St. Louis people want
to go on using this method and wish to secure the
best possible forecast, then they should ask the
MPS or any other large econometric model what
coefficients they should use for government
expenditure, rather than trying to estimate them
by their unreliable method.

From the theory and evidence reviewed, we
must then conclude that opting for a constant rate
of growth of the nominal money supply can
result in a stable economy only in the absence of
significant exogenous shocks. But obviously the
economy has been and will continue to be exposed
to many significant shocks, coming from
such things as war and peace, and other large
changes in government expenditure, foreign
trade, agriculture, technological progress, population
shifts, and what not. The clearest evidence
on the importance of such shocks is provided by
our postwar record with its six recessions.
IV. The Record of Stabilization Policies:
Stabilizing or Destabilizing

A. Was Postwar Instability Due to Unstable
Money Growth?

At this point, of course, monetarists will object
that, over the postwar period, we have not
had a constant money growth policy and will hint
that the observed instability can largely be traced
to the instability of money. The only way of
meeting this objection squarely would be, of
course, to rerun history with a good computer
capable of calculating 3 percent at the helm of
the Fed.

A more feasible, if less conclusive approach
might be to look for some extended periods in
which the money supply grew fairly smoothly
and see how the economy fared. Combing
through our post-Korean War history, I have
been able to find just two stretches of several
years in which the growth of the money stock
was relatively stable, whether one chooses to
measure stability in terms of percentage deviations
from a constant growth or of dispersion of
four-quarter changes. It may surprise some that
one such stretch occurred quite recently and
consists of the period of nearly four years beginning
in the first quarter of 1971 (see the author
and Papademos, 1976). During this period, the
average growth was quite large, some 7 percent,
but it was relatively smooth, generally well
within the 6 to 8 percent band. The average
deviation from the mean is about .75 percent.
The other such period lasted from the beginning
of 1953 to the first half of 1957, again a stretch
of roughly four years. In sharp contrast to the
most recent period, the average growth here is
quite modest, only about 2 percent; but again,
most four-quarter changes fell well within a
band of two percentage points, and the average
deviation is again .7. By contrast, during the
remaining 13-year stretch from mid-1957 to the
end of 1970, the variability of money growth
was roughly twice as large if measured by the
average deviation of four quarter changes, and
some five times larger if measured by the percentage
deviation of the money stock from a
constant growth trend.

How did the economy fare in the two periods
of relatively stable money growth? It is common
knowledge that the period from 1971 to 1974, or
from 1972 to 1975 if we want to allow a one-year
lag for money to do its trick, was distinctly the
most unstable in our recent history, marked by
sharp fluctuations in output and wild gyrations
of the rate of change of prices. As a result, the
average deviation of the four-quarter changes in
output was 3.3 percent, more than twice as large
as in the period of less stable money growth. But
the first stretch was also marked by well above
average instability, with the contraction of 1954,
the sharp recovery of 1955, and the new contraction
in 1958, the sharpest in postwar history
except for the present one. The variability of output
is again 50 percent larger than in the middle
period.

To be sure, in the recent episode serious exogenous
shocks played a major role in the development
of prices and possibly output, although the


### ---Economics-1977-0-14.txt---
same is not so readily apparent for the period
1953 to 1958. But, in any event, such extenuating
circumstances are quite irrelevant to my
point; for I am not suggesting that the stability of
money was the major cause of economic instability-
or at any rate, not yet! All I am arguing is
that (i) there is no basis for the monetarists' suggestion
that our postwar instability can be traced
to monetary instability-our most unstable
periods have coincided with periods of relative
monetary stability; and (ii) stability of the
money supply is not enough to give us a stable
economy, precisely because there are exogenous
disturbances.

Finally, let me mention that I have actually
made an attempt at rerunning history to see
whether a stable money supply would stabilize
the economy, though in a way that I readily
acknowledge is much inferior to the real thing,
namely through a simulation with the MPS. The
experiment, carried out in cooperation with
Papademos, covered the relatively quiet period
from the beginning of 1959 to the introduction of
price-wage controls in the middle of 1971. If
one eliminates all major sources of shocks, for
example, by smoothing federal government
expenditures, we found, as did Otto Eckstein in
an earlier experiment, that a stable money
growth of 3 percent per year does stabilize the
economy, as expected. But when we allowed for
all the historical shocks, the result was that with
a constant money growth the economy was far
from stable-in fact, it was distinctly less stable
than actual experience, by a factor of 50 percent.
B. The Overall Effectiveness of Postwar
Stabilization Policies

But even granted that a smooth money supply
will not produce a very stable world and that
there is therefore room for stabilization policies,
monetarists will still argue that we should nonetheless
eschew such policies. They claim, first,
that allowing for unpredictably variable lags and
unforseeable future shocks, we do not know
enough to successfully design stabilization
policies, and second, that the government would
surely be incapable of choosing the appropriate
policies or be politically willing to provide
timely enforcement. Thus, in practice, stabilization
policies will result in destabilizing the
economy much of the time.

This view is supported by two arguments, one
logical and one empirical. The logical argument
is the one developed in Friedman's Presidential
Address (1968). An attempt at stabilizing the
economy at full employment is bound to be destabilizing
because the full employment or
natural rate is not known with certainty and is
subject to shifts in time; and if we aim for the
incorrect rate, the result must perforce be explosive
inflation or deflation. By contrast, with a
constant money supply policy, the economy will
automatically hunt for, and eventually discover,
that shifty natural rate, wherever it may be
hiding.

This argument, I submit, is nothing but a
debating ploy. It rests on the preposterous assumption
that the only alternative to a constant
money growth is the pursuit of a very precise
unemployment target which will be adhered to
indefinitely no matter what, and that if the target
is off in the second decimal place, galloping
inflation is around the corner. In reality, all that
is necessary to pursue stabilization policies is a
rough target range that includes the warranted
rate, itself a range and not a razor edge; and, of
course, responsible supporters of stabilization
policies have long been aware of the fact that the
target range needs to be adjusted in time on the
basis of forseeable shifts in the warranted range,
as well as in the light of emerging evidence that
the current target is not consistent with price
stability. It is precisely for this reason that I, as
well as many other nonmonetarists, would side
with monetarists in strenuous opposition to
recent proposals for a target unemployment rate
rigidly fixed by statute (although there is nothing
wrong with Congress committing itself and the
country to work toward the eventual achievement
of some target unemployment rate through
structural changes rather than aggregate demand
policies).

Clearly, even the continuous updating of
targets cannot guarantee that errors can be


### ---Economics-1977-0-15.txt---
avoided altogether or even that they will be
promptly recognized; and while errors persist,
they will result in some inflationary (or deflationary)
pressures. But the growing inflation to
which Friedman refers is, to repeat, a crawl not a
gallop. One may usefully recall in this connection
the experience of 1965-70 referred to earlier,
with the further remark that the existence of
excess employment was quite generally recognized
at the time, and failure to eliminate it
resulted overwhelmingly from political considerations
and not from a wrong diagnosis.3
There remains then only the empirical issue:
have stabilization policies worked in the past and
will they work in the future? Monetarists think
the answer is negative and suggest, as we have
seen, that misguided attempts at stabilization,
especially through monetary policies, are responsible
for much of the observed instability.
The main piece of evidence in support of this
contention is the Great Depression, an episode
well documented through the painstaking work
of Friedman and Anna Schwartz, although still
the object of dispute (see, for example, Peter
Temin). But in any event, that episode while it
may attest to the power of money, is irrelevant
for present purposes since the contraction of the
money supply was certainly not part of a comprehensive
stabilization program in the postKeynesian
sense.

When we come to the relevant postwar period,
the problem of establishing the success or failure
of stabilization policies is an extremely taxing
one. Many attempts have been made at developing
precise objective tests, but in my view,
none of these is of much value, even though I am
guilty of having contributed to them in one of my
worst papers (1964). Even the most ingenious
test, that suggested by Victor Argy, and relying
on a comparison of the variability of income with
that of the velocity of circulation, turns out to
be valid only under highly unrealistic restrictive
assumptions.

Dennis Starleaf and Richard Floyd have proposed
testing the effectiveness of stabilization by
comparing the stability of money growth with
that of income growth, much as I have done
above for the United States, except that they
apply their test to a cross section of industrialized
countries. They found that for a sample of
13 countries, the association was distinctly
positive. But this test is again of little value. For
while a negative association for a given country,
such as suggested by my U.S. test, does provide
some weak indication that monetary activism
helped rather than hindered, the finding of a
positive association across countries proves
absolutely nothing. It can be readily shown, in
fact, that, to the extent that differential variability
of income reflects differences in the character
of the shocks-a most likely circumstance for
their sample-successful stabilization also
implies a positive correlation between the variability
of income and that of money.

But though the search for unambiguous quantitative
tests has so far yielded a meager crop,
there exists a different kind of evidence in favor
of Keynesian stabilization policies which is
impressive, even if hard to quantify. To quote
one of the founding fathers of business cycle
analysis, Arthur Burns, writing in 1959, "Since
1937 we have had five recessions, the longest of
which lasted only 13 months. There is no parallel
for such a sequence of mild-or such a sequence
of brief-contractions, at least during the past
hundred years in our country" (p. 2). By
now we can add to that list the recessions of
1961 and 1970.

There is, furthermore, evidence that very
similar conclusions hold for other industrialized
countries which have made use of stabilization
policies; at any rate that was the prevailing view
among participants to an international conference
held in 1967 on the subject, "Is the busi-
3Friedman's logical argument against stabilization policies
and in favor of a constant money growth rule is, I
submit, much like arguing to a man from St. Paul wishing to
go to New Orleans on important business that he would be a
fool to drive and should instead get himself a tub and drift
down the Mississippi: that way he can be pretty sure that the
current will eventually get him to his destination; whereas, if
he drives, he might make a wrong turn and, before he notices
he will be going further and further away from his destination
and pretty soon he may end up in Alaska, where he will
surely catch pneumonia and he may never get to New
Orleans!

ness cycle obsolete?" (see Martin Bronfenbrenner,
editor). No one seemed to question the
greater postwar stability of all Western economies-
nor is this surprising when one recalls
that around that time business cycle specialists
felt so threatened by the new-found stability that
they were arguing for redefining business cycles
as fluctuations in the rate of growth rather than
in the level of output.

It was recognized that the reduced severity of
fluctuations might in part reflect structural
changes in the economy and the effect of stronger
built-in stabilizers, inspired, of course, by
the Keynesian analysis. Furthermore, the greater
stability in the United States, and in other industrialized
countries, are obviously not independent
events. Still, at least as of the time of that
conference, there seemed to be little question
and some evidence that part of the credit for the
greater stability should go to the conscious and
on balance, successful endeavor at stabilizing
the economy.

V. The Case of Supply Shocks and the
1974-76 Episode

A. Was the 1974 Depression Due to Errors of
Commission or Omission?

In pointing out our relative postwar stability
and the qualified success of stabilization policies,
I have carefully defined the postwar period
as ending somewhere in 1973. What has happened
since that has so tarnished the reputation
of economists? In facing this problem, the first
question that needs to be raised is whether the
recent combination of unprecedented rates of
inflation as well as unemployment must be
traced to crimes of commission or omission. Did
our monetary and fiscal stabilization policies
misfire, or did we instead fail to use them?
We may begin by establishing one point that
has been blurred by monetarists' blanket indictments
of recent monetary policy: the virulent
explosion that raised the four-quarter rate of
inflation from about 4 percent in 1972 to 6.5
percent by the third quarter of 1973, to 11.5
percent in 1974 with a peak quarterly rate of
13.5, can in no way be traced to an excessive, or
to a disorderly, growth of the money supply. As
already mentioned, the average rate of money
growth from the beginning of 1970 to the second
half of 1974 was close to 7 percent. To be sure,
this was a high rate and could be expected sooner
or later to generate an undesirably high inflation
-but how high? Under any reasonable assumption
one cannot arrive at a figure much above 6
percent. This might explain what happened up to
the fall of 1973, but not from the third quarter
of 1973 to the end of 1974, which is the really
troublesome period. Similarly, as was indicated
above, the growth of money was reasonably
smooth over this period, smoother than at any
other time in the postwar period, staying within
a 2 percent band. Hence, the debacle of 1974
can just not be traced to an erratic behavior of
money resulting from a misguided attempt at
stabilization.

Should one then conclude that the catastrophe
resulted from too slavish an adherence to a stable
growth rate, forsaking the opportunity to use
monetary policy to stabilize the economy? In
one sense, the answer to this question must in
my view be in the affirmative. There is ample
ground for holding that the rapid contraction that
set in toward the end of 1974, on the heels of a
slow decline in the previous three quarters, and
which drove unemployment to its 9 percent
peak, was largely the result of the astronomic
rise in interest rates around the middle of the
year. That rise in turn was the unavoidable result
of the Fed's stubborn refusal to accommodate,
to an adequate extent, the exogenous inflationary
shock due to oil, by letting the money supply
growth exceed the 6 percent rate announced at
the beginning of the year. And this despite repeated
warnings about that unavoidable result
(see, for example, the author 1974).
Monetarists have suggested that the sharp
recession was not the result of too slow a monetary
growth throughout the year, but instead of
the deceleration that took place in the last half of
1974, and early 1975. But this explanation just
does not stand up to the facts. The fall in the
quarterly growth of money in the third and fourth
quarters was puny, especially on the basis of


### ---Economics-1977-0-17.txt---
revised figures now available: from 5.7 percent
in the second to 4.3 and 4.1-hardly much
larger than the error of estimate for quarterly
rates! To be sure, in the first quarter of 1975 the
growth fell to .6 percent. But, by then, the violent
contraction was well on its way-between
September 1974 and February 1975, industrial
production fell at an annual rate of 25 percent.
Furthermore, by the next quarter, monetary
growth had resumed heftily. There is thus no
way the monetarist proposition can square with
these facts unless their long and variable lags
are so variable that they sometimes turn into
substantial leads. But even then, by anybody's
model, a one-quarter dip in the growth of money
could not have had a perceptible effect.
B. What Macro Stabilization Policies
Can Accomplish, and How

But recognizing that the adherence to a stable
money growth path through much of 1974 bears
a major responsibility for the sharp contraction
does not per se establish that the policy was
mistaken. The reason is that the shock that hit
the system in 1973-74 was not the usual type of
demand shock which we have gradually learned
to cope with, more or less adequately. It was,
instead, a supply or price shock, coming from
a cumulation of causes, largely external. This
poses an altogether different stabilization problem.
In particular, in the case of demand shocks,
there exists in principle an ideal policy which
avoids all social costs, namely to offset completely
the shock thus, at the same time, stabilizing
employment and the price level. There
may be disagreement as to whether this target
can be achieved and how, but not about the
target itself.

But in the case of supply shocks, there is no
miracle cure-there is no macro policy which
can both maintain a stable price level and keep
employment at its natural rate. To maintain
stable prices in the face of the exogenous price
shock, say a rise in import prices, would require
a fall in all domestic output prices; but we know
of no macro policy by which domestic prices can
be made to fall except by creating enough slack,
thus putting downward pressure on wages. And
the amount of slack would have to be substantial
in view of the sluggishness of wages in the face
of unemployment. If we do not offset the exogenous
shock completely, then the initial burst,
even if activated by an entirely transient rise in
some prices, such as a once and for all deterioration
in the terms of trade, will give rise to further
increases, as nominal wages rise in a vain attempt
at preserving real wages; this secondary
reaction too can only be cut short by creating
slack. In short, once a price shock hits, there is
no way of returning to the initial equilibrium
except after a painful period of both above equilibrium
unemployment and inflation.

There are, of course, in principle, policies
other than aggregate demand management to
which we might turn, and which are enticing
in view of the unpleasant alternatives offered by
demand management. But so far such policies,
at least those of the wage-price control variety,
have proved disappointing. The design of better
alternatives is probably the greatest challenge
presently confronting those interested in stabilization.
However, these policies fall outside my
present concern. Within the realm of aggregate
demand management, the only choice open to
society is the cruel one between alternative feasible
paths of inflation and associated paths of
unemployment, and the best the macroeconomist
can offer is policies designed to approximate
the chosen path.

In light of the above, we may ask: is it conceivable
that a constant rate of growth of the
money supply will provide a satisfactory response
to price shocks in the sense of giving
rise to an unemployment-inflation path to which
the country would object least?
C. The Monetarist Prescription: Or, Constant
Money Growth Once More

The monetarists are inclined to answer this
question affirmatively, if not in terms of the
country's preferences, at least in terms of the
preferences they think it should have. This is
evidenced by their staunch support of a continuation
of the 6 percent or so rate of growth through


### ---Economics-1977-0-18.txt---
1974, 1975, and 1976.

Their reasoning seems to go along the following
lines. The natural rate hypothesis implies
that the rate of inflation can change only when
employment deviates from the natural rate. Now
suppose we start from the natural rate and some
corresponding steady rate of inflation, which
without loss of generality can be assumed as
zero. Let there be an exogenous shock which
initially lifts the rate of inflation, say, to 10 percent.
If the Central Bank, by accommodating
this price rise, keeps employment at the natural
rate, the new rate of 10 percent will also be maintained
and will in fact continue forever, as long
as the money supply accommodates it. The only
way to eliminate inflation is to increase unemployment
enough, above the natural rate and for
a long enough time, so that the cumulated reduction
of inflation takes us back to zero. There
will of course be many possible unemployment
paths that will accomplish this. So the next
question is: Which is the least undesirable?
The monetarist answer seems to be-and
here I confess that attribution becomes difficult
-that it does not make much difference because,
to a first approximation, the cumulated
amount of unemployment needed to unwind
inflation is independent of the path. If we take
more unemployment early, we need to take less
later, and conversely. But then it follows immediately
that the specific path of unemployment
that would be generated by a constant money
growth is, if not better, at least as good as any
other. Corollary: a constant growth of money is
a satisfactory answer to supply shocks just as it
is to demand shocks-as well as, one may suspect,
to any other conceivable illness, indisposition,
or disorder.

D. Why Constant Money Growth Cannot
Be the Answer

This reasoning is admirably simple and elegant,
but it suffers from several flaws. The first
one is a confusion between the price level and
its rate of change. With an unchanged constant
growth of the nominal money stock, the system
will settle back into equilibrium not when the
rate of inflation is back to zero but only when,
in addition, the price level itself is back to its
initial level. This means that when inflation has
finally returned back to the desired original rate,
unemployment cannot also be back to the original
level but will instead remain above it as long
as is necessary to generate enough deflation to
offset the earlier cumulated inflation. I doubt that
this solution would find many supporters and for
a good reason; it amounts to requiring that none
of the burden of the price shock should fall on
the holder of long-term money fixed contractssuch
as debts-and that all other sectors of society
should shoulder entirely whatever cost is
necessary to insure this result. But if, as seems
to be fairly universally agreed, the social target
is instead to return the system to the original rate
of inflation-zero in our example-then the
growth of the money supply cannot be kept constant.
Between the time the shock hits and the
time inflation has returned to the long-run level,
there must be an additional increase in money
supply by as much as the price level or by the
cumulant of inflation over the path.
A second problem with the monetarists' argument
is that it implies a rather special preference
function that depends only on cumulated unemployment.
And, last but not least, it requires the
heroic assumption that the Phillips curve be not
only vertical in the long run but also linear in the
short run, an assumption that does not seem
consistent with empirically estimated curves.
Dropping this last assumption has the effect that,
for any given social preference, there will be in
general a unique optimal path. Clearly, for this
path to be precisely that generated by a constant
money growth, would require a miracle-or
some sleight of the invisible hand!
Actually, there are grounds for holding that
the unemployment path generated by a constant
money growth, even if temporarily raised to take
care of the first flaw, could not possibly be close
to an optimal. This conclusion is based on an
analysis of optimal paths, relying on the type of
linear welfare function that appears to underlie
the monetarists' argument, and which is also a
straightforward generalization of Okun's famous


### ---Economics-1977-0-19.txt---
"economic discomfort index." That index
(which according to Michael Lovell appears to
have some empirical support) is the sum of unemployment
and inflation. The index used in my
analysis is a weighted average of the cumulated
unemployment and cumulated inflation over the
path. The weights express the relative social
concern for inflation versus unemployment.
Using this index, it has been shown in a forthcoming
thesis of Papademos that, in general, the
optimum policy calls for raising unemployment
at once to a certain critical level and keeping it
there until inflation has substantially abated. The
critical level depends on the nature of the Phillips
curve and the relative weights, but does not
depend significantly on the initial shock-as
long as it is appreciable. To provide an idea of
the order of magnitudes involved, if one relies on
the estimate of the Phillips curve reported in
my joint paper with Papademos (1975), which
is fairly close to vertical and uses Okun's
weights, one finds that (i) at the present time, the
noninflationary rate of unemployment corresponding
to a 2 percent rate of inflation can be
estimated at 5.6 percent, and (ii) the optimal response
to a large exogenous price shock consists
in increasing unemployment from 5.6 to only
about 7 percent. That level is to be maintained
until inflation falls somewhat below 4 percent;
it should then be reduced slowly until inflation
gets to 2.5 (which is estimated to take a couple of
years), and rapidly thereafter. If, on the other
hand, society were to rate inflation twice as
costly as unemployment, the initial unemployment
rate becomes just over 8 percent, though
the path to final equilibrium is then shorter.
These results seem intuitively sensible and quantitatively
reasonable, providing further justification
for the assumed welfare function, with its
appealing property of summarizing preferences
into a single readily understandable number.
One important implication of the nature of the
optimum path described above is that a constant
money growth could not possibly be optimal
while inflation is being squeezed out of the system,
regardless of the relative weights attached
to unemployment and inflation. It would tend
to be prevailingly too small for some initial
period and too large thereafter.
One must thus conclude that the case for a
constant money growth is no more tenable in the
case of supply shocks than it is in the case of
demand shocks.

VI. Conclusion

To summarize, the monetarists have made a
valid and most valuable contribution in establishing
that our economy is far less unstable than
the early Keynesians pictured it and in rehabilitating
the role of money as a determinant of
aggregate demand. They are wrong, however,
in going as far as asserting that the economy is
sufficiently shockproof that stabilization policies
are not needed. They have also made an
important contribution in pointing out that such
policies might in fact prove destabilizing. This
criticism has had a salutary effect on reassessing
what stabilization policies can and should do,
and on trimming down fine-tuning ambitions.
But their contention that postwar fluctuations
resulted from an unstable money growth or that
stabilization policies decreased rather than increased
stability just does not stand up to an
impartial examination of the postwar record of
the United States and other industrialized countries.
Up to 1974, these policies have helped to
keep the economy reasonable stable by historical
standards, even though one can certainly point
to some occasional failures.

The serious deterioration in economic stability
since 1973 must be attributed in the first place
to the novel nature of the shocks that hit us,
namely, supply shocks. Even the best possible
aggregate demand management cannot offset
such shocks without a lot of unemployment
together with a lot of inflation. But, in addition,
demand management was far from the best. This
failure must be attributed in good measure to the
fact that we had little experience or even an
adequate conceptual framework to deal with
such shocks; but at least from my reading of
the record, it was also the result of failure to
use stabilization policies, including too slavish
adherence to the monetarists' constant money

growth presciption.

We must, therefore, categorically reject the
monetarist appeal to turn back the clock forty
years by discarding the basic message of The
General Theorxv. We should instead concentrate
our efforts in an endeavor to make stabilization
policies even more effective in the future than
they have been in the past.

I. The Meaning of Supply and Demand
in a Macroeconomic Context

It is worth considering whether a new
basic model should guide our thinking
about performance of the economy as a
whole. It is not that the macro models of
the past twenty-five years or so have failed
to serve us well. When we consider the state
of our knowledge about the analytics of the
economy at the end of World War II and
the apprehensiveness with which we approached
the modern era of expansion, it
should be evident that we have come a long
way professionally. Yet the economic problems
of today seem to be intractable when
studied through the medium of simplified
macro models. The new system should
combine the Keynesian model of final demand
and income determination with the
Leontief model of interindustrial flows.
This is the motivation for my focusing attention
on the supply side of the economy.
It is frequently said, in almost an offhand
manner, that the theories of aggregate employment
and output determination are demand
models, that economic policy for
overall direction of the economy is a policy
of demand management. I would generally
agree with these remarks, but not in every
last detail, once the meaning of demand in
these contexts is carefully pulled apart and
analyzed. The demand aspects are possibly
overstated.

It is, of course, true that demand for the
GNP built up as the sum of demands by
consumers, businesses, government, and
foreigners (consumption, investment, public
spending, and net exports) covers total demand
in the economy and is composed of
demands by the constituent parts. But demand
by firms, and, in many cases by government,
are not ends in themselves. Business
demand is largely for goods to produce
goods. The capital formation that results
from business demand goes into the increment
of capital stock, after allowance for
capital consumption, and the capital stock
becomes a factor input in the production
function. The accumulation of capital contributes
to the supply of goods and services.
Indeed, investment demand now for new
capital facilitates the implementation of the
production process with the supply of factors
of ever-increasing powers of productivity,
thus making it possible to supply increasing
amounts of goods and services

with inputs that are increasing at a somewhat
slower rate.

By focusing attention excessively on the
"short run," in which the capital stock is
timelessly held fixed by assumption only
and not in reality, we have ignored the supply-
side characteristics of investment demand.
Students of today's business cycle
commonly cite investment demand as the
promising potential route to higher productivity
in the relatively near future, thereby
lessening inflationary pressure. In this respect,
economic theoreticians have been
myopic relative to the applied economic
analysts in the world of affairs. Nevertheless,
as we shall see, there is much more
to the supply side than the transformation
of investment into productive capital, and
the basic characterization of contemporary
macroeconomics as demand analysis has a
point. A strong indication of the demand
side orientation is given by the elaboration
of the standard macro model. In place of
aggregate consumption, the more elaborate
model gives separate treatment to consumer
expenditures on durables, nondurables, and
services. This is the first stage. At a higher
stage, there is further disaggregation into
types of durables, nondurables, and services
such as food, cars, medical services, etc.
The detail that is introduced for consumption


### ---Economics-1978-0-02.txt---
is repeated in business investment demand,
housing demand, public expenditures,
exports, and imports. Elaboration
essentially means taking a closer look at demand
side components by types of demand.
The mainstream model of macro economic
thought has thus become a detailed
system of demand analysis, but if it is to be
a closed system, it will also have to include
corresponding detail on the national income
side of the social accounts. If this is done
fully, there will have to be analyses of factor
rewards, factor use, and pricing. The development
of factor demand goes beyond capital
formation, which appears as a demand
for final goods in the GNP, and takes up
an explanation of wage income. An adequate
explanation of wage income cannot
avoid the explicit treatment of physical
production involving labor input as well as
capital input. The demand for labor, like
the demand for capital, is supply side analysis.
While the demand for capital enters directly
as a component of total demand, the
demand for labor, together with wage formation,
enters national income, and only
after expenditure does it enter final demand
for GNP. To the extent that labor productivity
affects wage determination and also
price formation, we find supply-side factors
influencing inflation and consequently the
overall performance of the economy. Labor
demand can also be associated with training.
The training component is, in fact,
investment in human rather than fixed
capital. Looked at in this way, factor demand
for labor and factor demand for fixed
capital are simply different, but related,
aspects of total investment.

Behind the IS-LM diagram or other simplified
renditions of the aggregate demand
model lie many supply-side relationships.
Not only is the supply side in the background,
but it also plays a more essential
role once it is recognized that the simplified
model is actually incomplete. If we were to
assume the existence of money illusion, it
would be possible to consider the IS-LM
system as a closed system of relationships
depending on nominal income and nominal
interest rates. I find this approach theoretically
unsatisfactory. That simple system
exists only as an aggregative approximation
for a given price level. If we assume no
money illusion and, more properly, I believe,
the need to determine the aggregate
price level, then the IS-LM diagram does
not provide a closed system analysis, and
we must extend the system to include the
whole supply-side apparatus of production
relationships, factor demand, and factor
supply.

It is well known that Keynes included
the aggregate supply function in the General
Theory, but it was introduced in his
chapter on "The Principle of Effective Demand.
" That part of his analysis dealing
with supply has been largely played down
by the profession at large-not by all students
of macroeconomics.' Also, by way of
side comment, Keynes probably confused
the issues by making labor supply dependent
on the nominal wage rate, assuming
the existence of money illusion, and by not
treating the stock of capital as an explicit
variable.

If the demand relationships explaining
the components of the GNP are disaggregated
into a highly detailed set, it does not
necessarily mean that the supply side must
be equally disaggregated to a similar extent,
as long as the total flow of income and
purchasing power to be directed towards
the expenditure flow can be generated. The
detailed expenditure flow will, however, involve
price relatives. That is a consequence
of disaggregation. An aggregate supply-side
explanation that generates only an average
price level for output as a whole can be
adequate, provided separate prices, needed
for the price-relatives, can be explained in
terms of a relationship to the overall price
or wage level. This is much like the use of a
term structure relationship in credit market
analysis to explain the spectrum of interest
rates, given one strategic rate.
It is, however, more satisfactory, and
more revealing, to explain the whole set of
prices, one by one, on the basis of costs
in individual sectors. These sector prices, on
the side of production, are then combined
with input weights into the several final deISee
Sidney Weintraub (1956, 1957).


### ---Economics-1978-0-03.txt---
mand prices needed to account for variation
in components of final expenditure. This
brings us to a fundamental set of new considerations
on the supply side.

II. The Task of Modeling Supply
If sector prices by line of production are
to be explained in a fundamental way by
sector costs, there will have to be an accompanying
explanation of sector outputs and
inputs. This brings us directly to the supply
side of things. While the supply side is
represented in the macro production function
from an aggregative point of view, once
we disaggregate the supply side by sector of
production, we encounter a new dimension.
The aggregate production function, in the
spirit of Paul Douglas and Charles Cobb,
expresses value-added as a function of primary
factor inputs, namely, labor and capital.
They were able to compress the technology
as they did, because at a full macro
level, one sector's output is someone else's
input, and for the economy as a whole, only
value-added is left in the output aggregation.
Intermediate inputs or outputs may be
neglected in the interests of avoiding double
counting. This way of looking at things is
strictly correct only for a closed economy.
In an open system, intermediate imports
must be treated like primary factor inputs.
At the sector level, however, there is no
question about the need to consider intermediate
inputs. Sector output (gross) is
properly a function of intermediate inputs,
labor input, and capital input-all sector
designated. The presently fashionable way
of summarizing this idea is to use the
KLEM production function, whose inputs
consist of capital, labor, energy, and materials.


The KLEM production function concept
is useful in partial studies of separate industries
or sectors, and has long been anticipated
in aggregative production function
studies. It has been routine in production
function studies in agriculture to use feed,
seed, fertilizer, and other intermediate inputs
as explanatory variables. The dependent
variable is generally a measure of gross
output gallons of milk, bushels of grain,
or bales of cotton. In manufacturing, one
of the earliest studies was by Ragnar Frisch.
He expressed isoquants for the output of
the Freia chocolate factory as a function of
fat content and molding-cooling input. One
of these is a pure material input and the
other stands for some capital, labor, and
general running cost input. In my own investigations
of U.S. railroad production

functions, I included fuel consumption (in
coal equivalents) as one of the factor inputs
together with labor and capital. The gross
output concept consisted of a log-linear
combination of ton miles and passenger
miles.2

These individual industry production
functions with a small number of intermediate
inputs are hardly substitutes for a detailed
input-output analysis on a general
system level. The role of input-output
analysis is to explain intermediate flows in
the economic system. The full system is
needed in order to provide an adequate supply
analysis because

(i) There is much more to economic activity
than can be summarized by the

system of final goods production.
(ii) The explanation of types of final
prices depends on highly specific
types of intermediate, as well as final,
goods/services prices.

The occurrence of bottlenecks potential
or realized as in the oil embargo of
1973--74 or the diversion of large amounts
of agricultural output to export markets as
in 1973 and 1975 are striking examples of
cases where there was a great deal of economic
activity going on outside final GNP
sectors. An economic understanding of
those activities and an estimate of their
macro impacts on the GNP could not be
readily derived from demand analysis without
consulting the table of intermediate
flows in I-0 analysis. These are only striking
examples. Many more have arisen in
the past, and more are bound to occur in
the future; therefore, the concern of this
presentation is not with singular events.
An adequate explanation of the price system,
especially on the cost side, cannot stop

### ---Economics-1978-0-04.txt---
at the KLEM level with separate consideration
of energy, materials, wage, and capital
costs. It must take account of prices of
grains, ferrous metals, nonferrous metals,
coal, crude oil, machinery, textiles, and the
other component prices in an input-output
system. The appropriate amount of detail
is not a fixed matter. It depends on human
capabilities of analysis, machine facilities,
data bases, and other practical considerations,
but it is, in any case, an order of
magnitude greater than contemplated by
mainstream macro model analysis.
From an analytical point of view, what is
being suggested is a full combination of two
systems of thought. the Leontief model and
the Keynesian model. That these two svstems
can be put back-to-back into a single
consistent model, with full feedback between
each part, is now well known, having
been implemented first with the Brookings
Model and later with various generations of
Wharton Models, and more recently by
Dale Jorgenson in a translog mode. A principal
feature of such combined systems is
that they are not based on restrictive assumptions
of the fixed coefficient inputoutput
model, but are generalized to allow
the coefVlcients of production to vary, according
to the variation of relative prices.
The above expression, "full feedback,"
means that the macro model of final demand
and national income generation cannot
be solved, by itself, without also solving
the input-output system for generatin- sector
production flows. Moreover sector
prices cannot be solved without also solving
the macro model simultaneously.
Price formation in individual sectors is
specified in terms of mark-up relations over
unit labor costs. Thus, sector outputs and
labor inputs are needed in order to explain
sector prices. These prices are needed, in
turn, in order to explain final demand
prices. Similarly, sector investment depends
on sector output as well as sector price.
It is for these and similar reasons that final
demand cannot be generated without making
use of the input-output system in order
to generate sector outputs.

At the same time, the input-output system
is driven by final demand; therefore,
the conventional macro demand model
must be used in order to solve the inputoutput
system. These are the specific senses
in which full feedback is used in order to
obtain simultaneous and consistent integration
of the entire supply and demand sides
of the economy.

In terms of the history of economic
thought, the above approach means thinking
in terms of the empirical implementation
of the Walrasian system. Essentially,
Tinbergen implemented the Keynesian system
and Leontief implemented a part of the
Walrasian system. By putting the two together,
with due allowance to Kuznets for
making the data bases of final demand and
national income available, a complete synthesis
of supply and demand in the economy
as a whole can be put together. This
gives the antecedents of what is meant by
modeling supply, taking into account what
is needed from demand models at the same
time.

III. Why Model Supply?

At the time of the Keynesian Revolution,
there was a pervasive deficiency of demand
throughout most of the world. The Keynesian
policy development, building on
that model, did, in my opinion, much good
for the economy of the Western world, enabling
us to come through an expansive era
of more than twenty-five years without a recurrence
of a Great Depression. That does
not mean that this system of thought and
policy formation did its work for all time
in putting the world economy on a stable
footing. It carried the situation only so far,
and undoubtedly underestimated inflation
potentials, leaving us now at the point
where new systems of thought, drawing
more on the supply side, are needed in
order to develop policies that will be able
to deal with the world's contemporary economic
problems; hopefully, policies that
will have as much longevity as the demand
management policies of the last two to three
decades. That should bring us nicely into
the twenty-first century, which is about as
far ahead as we might attempt to look at the
present time.


### ---Economics-1978-0-05.txt---
The limits of demand management policies
have become clearly visible in recent
years. Let us look at the issues through the
medium of specific problems, say the joint
problems of too much unemployment and
too much inflation. Policies of demand
management alone have appeared to be
adequate to deal with one or the other, but
not both together. If demand is stimulated
enough to bring down the unemployment
rate to a full-employment minimum, there
is danger of generating undue inflationary
pressure as a side effect. Conversely, antiinflationary
policies of demand restriction
run the danger of generating excessive unemployment
while holding down the inflation
rate.

How might supply-side policies be introduced
to lower both the inflation and unemployment
rates at the same time'? It is
conventionally thought that policies of aggregative
demand stimulus through traditional
fiscal and monetary policies might be
able to bring down the U.S. unemployment
rate to about 5.5 percent. This is not a firm
point estimate, and is subject to error of at
least one-half point above or below that
figure, but it is not, in any case, a full-employment
target figure.

One way, but not the only way, of getting
to full employnment without generating fresh
inflationary pressure is to design a jobs program
for about 1.0 million long-term, hard
core unemployed. This jobs program cannot
be described in full detail in the context
of this presentation, but it is not to be
viewed as an ordinary public jobs program.
It is viewed as a job training program
aimed at people who show signs of receptivity
to training and enlisting the participation
of employers who provide really productive
jobs with potential for upward
mobility. The 1.0 million target, spread over
three years, is not purely indicative. It is
meant to be plausible and necessary if full
employment is to be reached by 1980-82 in
the United States.

Apart from the fact that some public
funds are to be spent on this program, it is
not a typical demand management policy.
It is aimed at increasing the supply of
goods, at raising labor productivity, at sectors
of the economy where job training can
be accomodated or needed, and at sectors
of the labor force. It is basically a supplyside
policy and needs for its implementation/
assessment a full scale analysis through
the medium of a Leontief-Keynes system.
In first approximations, such assessments
have been made with the appropriate version
of the Wharton Model.

In anticipation of criticism of this policy
approach from the side of those who are
strongly wedded to emphasis on demand
management, I want to stress that a jobs
program aimed at increasing productivity
and reducing hard core unemployment is
not a futile exercise in pushing some subsidized
workers into the ranks of the employed
while pushing others out. The program
is intended to have balance; i.e., to be
part of a larger program with corresponding
support from the demand side. Such
support could not be justified from the
point of view of inflation potential unless
steps are being taken to complement the
effect with a jobs program and eventual
lifting of productivity. Undue preoccupation
with demand policies is not going to be
adequate to meet the problems of the day,
nor is pure emphasis on supply. Both sides
of the economy must be coordinated in
policy formation.

It should also be emphasized that demand
policies of federal expenditures for
public service employment appear to be inferior
to private sector jobs programs of
the type being mentioned here. In the
former case, there is no long-term opportunity
for those taken into the program and
there is no contribution to national productivity.
As long as job expenditures are going
to be made, they ought, preferably, to be directed
to an effort that promises to have
some lasting benefit.

This example of the jobs program is one
that fits the contemporary American economic
scene and has been investigated with
a U.S. model and data. The underlying
idea, however, is meant to be much more
general. It is that the whole industrial world
is faced with a series of new supply-side
economic problems. The problems of cyclical
stabilization and reaching full employment


### ---Economics-1978-0-06.txt---
without inflation will have to be
dealt with as before, and the latter will require
some degree of supply-side analysis in
other economies as in the U.S. case, but a
whole new range of economic issues looms
on the horizon. These are development of
new, greater energy supplies, protection of
the environment, controlling the exhaustion
of resources, enhancing agricultural supplies,
balancing population development,
and others of like nature. The juggling of
public budgets, the setting of tax rates, and
the giving of a tone to money market conditions
are not going to deal effectively with
this new class of problems, from the viewpoints
of influencing them in a favorable
direction. Similarly, the demand oriented
model is not going to provide much understanding
of them.

The coming problems of the industrial
economy are not going to be wholly dealt
with or analyzed on the basis of the general
purpose Leontief-Keynes system that is
being advocated here. In many cases, the
unforeseen problems that are bound to arise
are going to be more specialized than can
be conveniently anticipated. In such cases,
the analysis must extend into partial system
analysis giving more detailed and explicit
treatment on the supply side. In terms of
model building that means construction of
many "satellite" systems on the supply side,
as the need arises. At the present time,
many energy satellite systems are being developed
to deal with new fuel processes,
large energy using sectors, and large energy
delivery sectors. These satellite systems are
then all linked, in a technical and consistent
way, with the input-output cum macro
model system. In any event, the intent is to
move the discussion of macroeconomics
and policy formation to a new plane of discourse.


The discussion, thus far, has focused on
the modeling and related policy problems
for the modern industrial economy. The
analysis of the supply side, however, is not a
new issue for the developing economy. A
deficiency of demand analyzed within the
framework of the Keynesian Model has not
generally been thought to be the issue or
approach for dealing with the problems of
economic development. That is not to say
that demand relations are nonexistent or
unimportant for the developing economy. It
is primarily a matter of emphasis. Availability
of fixed capital treated as a limiting
factor in production is central to understanding
the problems facing many developing
economies.

Energy problems of production and use
are already apparent, as are population
control and agricultural production. Where
problems of environmental protection and
resource exhaustion have not yet arisen,
they are bound to occur in significant instances;
therefore, it is wise for the development
economist to be forearmed with a full
model for analysis of both supply and demand
sides.

The centrally planned economies are for
the most part industrial economies and
have the same needs for supply-side analysis.
In their cases, the supply side has perhaps
been excessively developed with inadequate
attention paid to the demand side,
not from the viewpoint of deficient demand
but from the viewpoint of chronic excess
demand, with latent inflationary pressure.
The present analysis attempts to look at a
particular facet of the modern economy,
namely the supply side. That does not imply,
by any means, that monetary analysis
and policy are unimportant. Most of the
supply-side problems have monetary implications
or aspects; therefore, monetary
policy must be appropriate to insure the
smooth working of the supply side of the
economy.

In terms of the analytical apparatus
needed to combine monetary analysis with
the kind of supply-demand model that I
have outlined above, it is a matter of integrating
the flow-of-funds system together
with the input-output and final demand national
income system. It would also be in a
full feedback mode. To complement the
supply-side detail underlying the IS curve,
we would turn to the complete flow-offunds
model to provide background for the
LM curve.

It is my feeling that overall monetary and
fiscal policies have been overworked, with
expectations of results that are not j ustified.


### ---Economics-1978-0-07.txt---
Without downgrading their very important
role, the present message simply says that
a full supply-side analysis must be developed
into which an elaborated IS-LM system
of thought can be fully integrated.

The title of my address implicitly assumes
that economics is itself one of the sciences.
I believe that to be so, and intend as I go on
to indicate more fully in what sense I hold
that view. However, my principal aim in
choosing my topic is not that of claiming
any particular status for economic analysis.
Rather, I want to share with you some observations
I have made over the last six

years as a result of involvement in various
interdisciplinary studies, through reading
the reports of other such studies, or discussing
them with colleagues in various
fields of science.

With increasing frequency natural and
social scientists are indeed finding themselves
thrown together in the study of new
problems that are of great practical importance
for society, and essentially interdisciplinary
in character. Prominent among

these are problems of environmental policy,
such as the protection of air and water
quality. Another class of problems concerns
a desirable long-range mix of technologies
of energy supply, conversion and use. These
two classes of problems overlap, for instance,
with respect to the disposal of nuclear
wastes, heat rejection to the environment,
and in the case of fossil fuels the
as yet poorly understood global and regional
effects of sustained large releases of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Assembled in pursuit of such studies, our
interdisciplinary group soon finds that its
diverse participants ask different questions;
use different concepts; use different terms
for the same concept and the same term
with different meanings; explicitly or implicitly
make different assumptions; and
perceive different opportunities for empirical
verification which may lead them
to apply different methods to that end. The
result can be politely concealed bewilderment,
possibly a suppressed surge of "weand-
they" feeling, in the worst case a growing
mistrust that only time and sustained
interaction can overcome.

I shall try to illustrate the difficulties of
such interaction by a few examples from recent
studies involving, besides economics,
mostly the natural sciences and engineering.
Limitations of experience, background, and
time have compelled me to omit examples
involving a strong participation from the
other social sciences. Had my guide, mentor,
and dear friend Jacob Marschak lived
to give this address, and had he chosen a
similar topic, the social sciences would have
received an emphasis reflecting their importance
to the problems of contemporary society.
The writings Marschak left us, and
the program and the Proceedings of last
year's meeting of the American Economic
Association, stand together as a monument
to his awareness and vision of the
actual and potential contributions of the
social and behavioral sciences.
To prepare for the task I have set myself,
I have requested and obtained interviews
with a somewhat casually selected sample
of natural scientists and engineers, and with
a few colleagues in economics. Their responses
have been drawn on in the preparation
of this address, without attribution by
name. I here express my, and indeed our,
indebtedness for the help we have been
given. Later on, I will cite some statements
verbatim.

Table 1 can serve as a two-dimensional
table of contents for my discussion. Three
topics of study are listed on the left. On
each of the three topics a recent study has

been made by or for the National Research
Council. I will draw mostly on the first two
studies and briefly mention the third.
My principal intent is not that of criticizing
these studies or of evaluating their findings.
I want merely to identify some of the
issues that arise in their formulation, contrast
responses to these issues in different
professions, and comment on the methods
that have been or might have been proposed
or applied by the respective collaborating
professions. Those issues and

methods that I shall have time to refer to
are set out along the top of the table.
Each check mark in a cell of the table indicates
that a reference is made to that issue
or method in my discussion of that topic of
study.

1. The Case for Helium Conservation
This study is described in the preface to
the report of the Helium Study Committee
as "a task that had to be undertaken
quickly and completed with great speed."'
Likewise, on the concluding page (40), it is
called a "preliminary analysis.'
The principal current source of helium is
as an optional by-product of the production
of natural gas, in which it may occur in concentrations
ranging (by volume) from 10

percent on down with increasing costs of
separation. Present demand for various industrial
and space uses falls below present
supply, and a program of storage in the partially
depleted Cliffside gas field near
Amarillo, Texas, is in operation. The study
is motivated by the anticipation of a substantially
higher future demand.

The report of the Helium Study Committee
lists, on pages 35-36, five steps that
can be taken for the purpose of increasing
the rate of storage. I paraphrase:
Step i: Stop the current venting of
helium which has been separated from
natural gas allocated as a feedstock to
petro-chemical industries. Store the
helium instead.

Step ii: Designate helium currently
stored in Cliffside a "national strategic
reserve" for possible major technical
changes that may greatly expand future
demand.

Step iii: Reactivate presently idle
separation plants to reduce the release of


### ---Economics-1979-0-05.txt---
helium resulting from productive combustion
of the host gas, and store the
helium instead.

Step iv: Build new helium separation
plants on helium-rich gas streams. Store
the helium.

Step v: Delay the use of helium-rich
gas fields, undeveloped, and already producing.


Ultimate Step: Extract helium from the
atmosphere.

The ultimate step is not included in the
report of the Committee, but is mentioned
in the transcript, page 135, of the Public
Forum held as part of the study. It involves
a process that by present technology costs a
large multiple of the cost of extraction from
natural gas containing .3 to .5 percent
helium.

Steps i, iii, iv, and the "ultimate step"
consist of successive technical process
choices. Taken in that order, they correspond
to the economist's notion of a
long-run supply curve, indicating how the
cost of each additional unit of supply is a
rising step function of the cumulative supply
up to that point assuming a constant
state of the technology of extraction. These
steps need to be carried out only according
as the expectation of demand growth becomes
larger and firmer. Steps ii and v are
steps whose timing should depend on additional
factors besides the separation cost
sequence already mentioned.

The expectation of a much larger demand
well into the twenty-first century is documented,
in the report and in the Forum, by
a fascinating enumeration of anticipated
future technologies. Many of these are based
on or may utilize superconductivity, so far
attained best by cryogenic techniques for
which helium is the working fluid. The
superconductivity is in turn expected to be
applicable to a number of uses, such as
power transmission with low energy loss,
energy storage, and a number of applications
of strong magnetic fields. Among the
latter are several "technologies that either
do not now exist or are in early stages of
development" (pp. 13-18), such as magnetic
containment for nuclear fusion reactors.
Another possible application is magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) power generation

that converts some of the energy contained
in a high temperature gas stream from either
a coal-fired burner or a nuclear fission reactor
directly into electricity, instead of routing
all the energy through a conventional
steam cycle. The MHD development is
further along in the Soviet Union. There
also is a development furthest along in
West Germany and Japan-of magnetically
levitated low-noise high-speed trains.
It should be added that research is in
progress on the use of aluminum and possibly
other materials reaching low resistivity
at temperatures of 20-30?K, a range reachable
using liquid hydrogen as a coolant.
(See L. A. Hall, National Bureau of Standards
Report, and E. B. Forsyth et al.)
From the economic point of view, the
case for the helium storage program is not
convincingly made either in the report or
in the Forum. I have not found either cost
or benefit estimates for the program. Actually,
because of the importance of energy
supply processes among the increased uses
of helium listed above, the benefits cannot
be estimated without comparable cost and
fuel availability estimates for alternative
energy supply and use technologies which
have low or zero helium requirements. In
other words, to assess the helium storage
program, one also needs a long-run model
of the energy sector of the economy that
addresses the second decision problem of
Table 1. One will, of course, also need to
consider other important helium uses that
are not directly energy related.
Before turning to problem (2), I draw attention
to a few passages in the Helium Report
that will provide background for Sections
III and IV below, where I shall discuss
the choice of measures of value in which to
express benefits and costs. The report
(p. 23) contains an important piece of information
bearing on cost comparisons, to
the effect that the energy requirements for


### ---Economics-1979-0-06.txt---
extracting helium from the atmosphere are
about 1,000 times those for extracting it
from natural gas containing .3 to .5 percent
of helium. Large as that figure is, I shall describe
later the economist's case (Section
III) for including in the calculation inputs
other than energy, such as that for plant
and equipment, and (Section IV) for taking
into account that the costs of all kinds in
any required future extraction from the atmosphere
will not be incurred until much
later.

In fact, one statement in the report reads
as a rejection of the idea that the time at
which capital cost is incurred is at all pertinent.
In a description of the possible role
of the government in implementing the five
steps, the report says: "The burden of the
discount rate as a criterion of performance
could be eliminated and the present debt to
the U.S. Treasury written off' (p. 38). I
shall explain in Section IV why I think not
many economists will support the proposal
to eliminate the criterion of the discount
rate. Meanwhile, the statement leads one to
infer that the capital cost component is not
negligible as a factor in the decision.
II. Technology Mixes of Future
Energy Supply and Use

My second illustration is a study that was
carried out as an input to the deliberations
of the Committee on Nuclear and Alternative
Energy Systems (CONAES, in short),
and of its Synthesis Panel. It is entitled
"Energy Modeling for an Uncertain Future.
" As explained in the preface, it is a
"supporting paper" published without having
gone through the customary report review
procedure of the Academy. While for
the other illustrations I have not named
authors or committee chairpersons, I
should not conceal that I was the chairman
of the group, called the Modeling Resource
Group (MRG), which collectively did the
work described in its Report. The group
consisted mostly of economists and operations
researchers, two somewhat like-minded
professions. My comments on interdisciplinary
interactions about the ideas and
findings of the group will therefore draw
on discussions with members of other professions
within and outside CONA ES.

For that purpose it may suffice to give
only the briefest description of the questions
addressed, the assumptions made, and
the methods used. One important question
arises from the fact that several competing
objectives enter into the choice of a longrun
energy technology mix. The net economic
effect (economic benefit minus cost)
of the development of a given technology
mix can be estimated in a crude way, as suggested
in Table 1, column (a), by its effect
on the Gross National Product (GNP). In
addition, one will also want to register risks
of adverse effects such as mining accidents,
air pollution, acid rain, oil spills, possible
leakage from nuclear waste disposal, or diversion
or proliferation of weapons-grade
nuclear materials. For brevity, all such effects
will be called "environmental" effects.
The place in Table 1 for these impacts is
column (b), tersely dubbed "health and
life."

The Risk/Impact Panel of CONAES decided
not to try to estimate money equivalents
for such adverse impacts of various
magnitudes. Were such estimates possible
and available, then one could also define
and find a balance between desired benefits
and adverse "environmental" impacts that
remain after scrubbers, inspectors, Civex
and the like have done their jobs. Not having
such estimates, the MRG turned the
question around: Assume that tentatively
chosen upper bounds are imposed on the
use of technologies that have such impacts.
Estimate the loss in GNP associated with
these bounds. Then that number also places
a price tag on the reduction in "environmental"
impacts achieved by those bounds.
Thus, even if an a priori valuation of the
reduction in impacts is not available, then
such a valuation is still implicit in any
decision actually taken. It may help the
decision makers to know these implicit
price tags.

I will list only the principal assumptions
made for this purpose. Numerical values
were assigned to three sets of variables. As


### ---Economics-1979-0-07.txt---
principal exogenous, also called "realization,
" variables we chose:

R1. The growth rate of real GNP, out to
2010, in the absence of new environmental
bounds on energy technologies.


R2. Capital cost levels of present and potential
future energy technologies.

R3. Availabilities of oil, gas, uranium, at
various costs of extraction.

R4. Long-run price and income elasticities
of demand for end-use energy

forms.

The "policy" variables represent the hypothetical
bounds already described,

P1. Moratoria on new nuclear construction.


P2. Limits placed on output of coal and
shale oil.

Forming a third category, the "blend" variables
have traits of both realization and
policy variables,

Bi. Discount rates applied to future
benefits and costs.

B2. Oil import price or quantity ceilings.
The method applied was to compare the
already specified projection of a rising future
GNP in which no bounds have been imposed
on the use of energy technologies (the
base case), with other projections in which
such a bound or bounds were imposed. This
procedure was carried out for each of three
long-run models of the U.S. energy sector.
The numerical inputs into the three models
were the same for almost all realization and
blend variables, except for the price and income
elasticities of demand, which were
specific to each model. Two ideas central to
current economic analysis entered into this
procedure. One is the use of an optimization
algorithm to simulate the behavior of a
competitive market economy, in any one
year, and through time. The other is the use
of long-run elasticities of demand. For demand
by end-use consumers, these are to be
based on econometric analysis of timeseries
and/or cross sections of income,
prices, and quantities consumed. For industrial
demand, a process analysis of alternative
industrial energy-using processes
may add valuable information.

The principal finding was the proportionally
small effect on GNP of sizable cuts
in energy use below its base case growth
path. In interpreting this finding, note that
the optimization procedure implies an assumption
whereby the economy responds to
anticipated changes by minimizing the cost
of adaptation. The principal means of adaptation
are changes in the type and composition
of the capital equipment for the extraction,
conversion, transport, and use of
energy-at the regular time for replacement
or earlier.

Table 2 shows the numerical results. For
two models, with price elasticities of -.25
and -.4, respectively, policies entailing percentage
cuts in energy use out of the base
case that gradually increase to between 10
and 20 percent in the year 2010, were found
to cut not more than 2 percent out of the
discounted sum of annual real GNP, 1975-
2010, and a comparably small percentage
out of GNP for the single year 2010. The
instruments of the curtailment of growth in
energy use were, in row (1) of the table, the
placement of bounds on specific energy supply
technologies described above. In row
(2), a zero-energy-growth path is simulated
by the imposition of a hypothetical "conservation
tax" on primary energy flows. The
rate of this fictitious tax must increase as
the GNP continues to grow in spite of the
downward pull from the zero-energy-growth
path.

Another finding, reported in row (2), was
that for the effects of the larger cuts in
energy use, the value of the long-run price
elasticity of demand for energy becomes
crucial. In a sensitivity analysis made with
one model, a zero-energy-growth policy
from 1975 on, leading to a 60 percent cut in
energy use out of the base case in 2010,
was found to induce only a 2 percent cut in
cumulative discounted GNP if that price
elasticity is -.5, but a 30 percent cut if it is

111. Interdisciplinary Differences in Outlook
We have now assembled enough reference
material for us to make a start with our
main topic-the way in which differences in
outlook between the disciplines affect the
conduct and evaluation of joint studies.
The most significant difference between
economics and the natural sciences lies in
the opportunities for testing and verification
of hypotheses. Jacob Marschak used to say
that economists carry the combined burdens
of meteorologists and engineers. Like
the meteorologists, they are expected to predict
the future course of important variables
in their field of study. Just as engineers
design more and more efficient
machines, economists are also expected to
improve the design of society where it affects
good use of resources. But, like the
meteorologist, the economist has traditionally
been confined to drawing inferences
from passive observations, records of data
generated by the turbulence of the atmosphere
or the fluctuations and trends of
economic life. Finally-a very important
difference-meteorologists and engineers
have all the laws and measurements established
by physics and chemistry available
to them, fully documented by experimental
tests and results.

Traditionally, economists have not
searched for similar inputs from experimental
or observational research of a
psychological or sociological nature. In the
1950's and early 1960's they have engaged
in some experimentation of their own on behavior
under uncertainty and in bargaining
and gaming situations. However, the findings
of this work have not been put to use
as premises for modeling an entire economy.
For that purpose, over a few articulate protests,
many economists have been satisfied
to postulate simple rules of behavior by
consumers and business firms. The terms
"introspection" and "casual empiricism"
have been used to describe the cognitive
sources of these premises. In the version of
the currently dominant "neoclassical"
school of thought, these premises express
optimizing responses of demand and supply
to a uniform price system: satisfaction
maximizing by consumers, profit maximizing
by firms.

These premises have a certain intuitive
plausibility about them. Undoubtedly, their
widespread adoption has also been aided by
the richness of the body of inferences one
can draw from them. In fact, the premises
form the logical foundation for the paradigm
of neoclassical economics: the concept of an
equilibrium of prices and quantities that in
some way ties together the economic decisions
taken by all seemingly independent
agents. Conceptually the prices and the
quantity responses may describe a stationary
state over an extended period of
time. More realistically, they may be dated
variables and thus also link decisions that
vary over successive periods, to sustain a
moving intertemporal equilibrium.
Parenthetically, use of the term equilibrium
does not imply an assumption that


### ---Economics-1979-0-09.txt---
the real economy actually is at any time "in
equilibrium." Rather, the notion of equilibrium
is a first approximation, a reference
point or path, like the cycles of Ptolemy
without the epicycles and the eccentricity.
If the market were to extend to all pertinent
economic decisions over the entire
period considered, the result of an intertemporal
equilibrium would be an "efficient"
path of the economy in the limited
sense that no one can be made better off at
any time without someone being made
worse off at some time. Where market
power interferes with competition, or where
important economic decisions are made at
government levels, the instinct of the neoclassical
economist is to recommend that
legislation, regulation, the use of suitable
incentives, or direct government decision
either restore or mimic the operation of the
competitive market.

In the present context, an important trait
of the neoclassical model is that it does not
postulate one sole primary resource, be it
labor, energy or any other, whose scarcity
controls that of all other goods, and which
thereby becomes a natural unit of value for
all other goods. The model of production is
such that-not by logical necessity, but as
an empirical fact--any primary input to
production can be substituted to some extent
for any other. If such substitution does
not take place within one-and-the-same
production process, then it can still come
about through suitable changes in the levels
of several processes and in the inputs to
these. In this view "the energy problem" is
not one of just "saving energy," regardless
of the cost in other resources. It is rather
one of seeing to it that the increasing real
cost of domestic energy extraction and supply,
and the increased market power of
OPEC, are-over time-reflected in the
real prices of primary energy forms relative
to other primary inputs, and thereby in different
degrees in the prices of all other
goods and services. In the projections described
above, the energy prices are calculated
so as to be in balance with an efficient
path of the technology mix into the
future, and thereby to induce the right
amount of energy saving. In particular if, as
projected by MRG, real prices of primary
energy rise in this path, then energy use is
projected to grow less than proportionally
to GNP.

The contrary doctrine-that regardless of
prices there is a persistent relationship between
energy use and GNP-has frequently
been expressed in the engineering literature.
In line with this observation, the MRG finding
of a possible small impact on GNP of
incisive bounds on specific energy technologies
led to lively correspondence and
discussions with members of CONA ES, and
of its Supply/Delivery Panel, an engineering-
oriented group. I should add that the
MRG study was not the first modeling study
to cast doubt on the doctrine referred to.
By my knowledge the first was a study by
Edward Hudson and Dale Jorgenson.
IV. Discounting Future Benefits and Costs
We are now ready for a closer look at the
discounting of future benefits and costs.
This practice reflects a simple technological
fact combined with the paradigm of equilibrium
over time. The simple fact is thatshort
of capital saturation-society can
temporarily curtail the production of current
consumption goods by transferring
some factors of production to the formation
of additional suitable capital goods,
in such a way as to return a multiple (> 1) of
the same unit bundle of consumption goods
in the future. Efficient intertemporal equilibrium
then demands that the present

value of the goods returned to consumption
be equal to that of the goods not now
consumed. The quantity of the future
bundle being larger, its per-unit present
value must be correspondingly lower. In a
projection that gives to one unit of the future
bundle a future real market price numerically
equal to its current price, a discount
factor d < 1 must be applied to the
future market price to obtain the present
value, per unit of the future bundle. Given
competitive markets for capital, present
goods and future goods, and ignoring differences
in risk, different investments bearing


### ---Economics-1979-0-10.txt---
fruit in the same future year t will tend
to give rise to the same discount factor
I t

dt + )

where rt is the annual discount rate applicable
to the period from year zero to year
t. The usual practice in cost-benefit analyses
is to assume also that rt is independent of
t, rt = r, say.

This reasoning simply registers the economic
accounting implications of assumed
intertemporal efficiency with capital nonsaturation.
To many highly educated

people, there is something ethically offensive
about it.

A difficult practical problem on which
economists still differ among themselves is
how to read a good estimate for r from
capital market and other data. Different tax
rates on corporate and individual incomes
complicate the problem. Considering this
and various market imperfections, the precluded
alternative use of funds drawn upon
for a public project also enters into the
choice of r. I will not venture into these
questions here.

Coming back to helium storage, the discounting
criterion would lead most economists
to recommend that those steps of the
storage program be implemented for which
the rate of return on the total investment
(not that on energy alone) exceeds or equals
the discount rate appropriate to the problem.
Step i, storing helium currently vented,
is likely to meet the test. The problem is to
estimate which of the four or six steps
would.

Two final remarks, the first added as an
afterthought since August 30.

The two issues we have discussedwhether
to count only energy costs or all
costs, and whether or not to discount future
benefits and costs-are logically distinct
implications of the notion of intertemporal
equilibrium. However, psychologically they
are related. If one counts only energy costs,
everything is expressible in equivalent
Btu's, and to the physicist, steeped in the
law of conservation of energy, Btu's are the
same everywhere and at all times. To discount
future Btu's therefore seems not just
strange but outright wrong. So it is. But the
economist does not discount quantities of
any kind. He discounts only real values,
that is, quantities (including energy) multiplied
by real prices that reflect the expected
balance of cost and preference as of a
specified future time and beyond. It is to
these prices that the discount factor is applied.
I am hoping that this simple distinction
may help to reduce misunderstanding
between the professions.

Secondly, our reasoning has proceeded
blandly as if there were no uncertainty about
the outcome of the development of processes
expected to be substantial users of helium.
If there is considerable uncertainty, economists
may want to add an allowance for risk
to the discount rate. They may also wish to
experiment with models in which judgmental
probabilities are attached to these
uncertain outcomes. This device may produce
insights even if the conclusions depend
on admittedly uncertain premises. A
study of this kind is included as chapter IV
in the MRG report.

V. Attaching Values to Health and Life
The question of estimating the value of
health and the value of life arises mostly in
contexts where either public decisions, or
public monitoring of private decisions, can
be shaped so as to improve health and prolong
life. One example is the investment of
public funds to diminish physical risks to
traffic by the design of roads, bridges, turnouts,
and crossings. Another is regular expenditures
for traffic police, building inspectors,
and other law enforcers who

restrain some people from killing or hurting
themselves or others by recklessness or
neglect.

A common trait of these decisions is that
from good experience records one may be
able to estimate the years of lives saved,
perhaps also of health and limbs preserved,
per dollar spent on efficiently run projects
or activities of this kind. Such calculations
make it possible to spot discrepancies between
different projects in regard to "health


### ---Economics-1979-0-11.txt---
and life benefits" bought per dollar spent.
The ideal of equilibrium then suggests redistributing
expenditures, if needed, in order
to maximize total benefits from the
given expenditure for protection. Valuations
of health or life that have a modicum
of public approval could result from such
redistribution. Note that these valuations,
also called shadowv prices, are in efTect set by
the budgetary decision makers, whether
they are aware of it or not.

After such redistribution if called for, the
calculation of money values of health and
life registers what in good practice we consistently
spend to save a life. The process
recognizes that, disturbing as it is to our
sensibilities, society is being compelled by
the facts of technology and behavior to set
up equivalences between lives of unidentified
people and bundles of goods and services
implicitly of the same market or
shadow value - --thus bracketing contemporary
lives together with current goods
and services in the same category of exchangeables.


The examples given so far concern small
to moderate risks affecting small to moderate
numbers of people, less than 100 at a
time, say. Moreover, the time intervals between
the decision to commit funds for the
reduction of risks, the actual expenditure of
these funds, and the reaping of benefits
therefrom are moderate, less than twenty
years, say. Finally, the problems are mostly
local or national, not international in scope.
The long-run choices between energy
technology mixes are different in these respects.
By a gradual shift from oil and gas
to coal, fossil fuels can remain a principal
source of energy for countries with abundant
resources of coal, especially the United
States, the USSR, and China, for a long
time to come. Intensive current discussion
with regard to this option concerns the possible
climatic effects of the increase in the
atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
caused by continued large-scale combustion
of fossil fuels or their derivatives,
alongside with world-wide deforestation.
Among the large-scale effects held possible
are an increase in average global
temperature, entailing dislocation of agriculture
depending on how each region is
affected, and an increase in the level of the
oceans due to the melting of polar ice not
previously floating. The present state of
knowledge is not such as to be ready for an
assessment of these risks. New hypotheses
and observations appear regularly in the
pages of Science and other journals. So I
would describe this problem as involving an
unknown risk to a large number of people.
If current estimates of the capital cost of
central station solar power are realistic, the
principal alternative to fossil fuels for bulk
power generation is nuclear power. I am
not qualified to even comment on the reactor
safety and waste disposal problems. I
assume, however, that the developers of
these technologies would classify these
problems in terms of very small risks to
substantial numbers of people. Perhaps this
leaves as the principal concern the difficulty
of keeping industrial and weapons use of
nuclear materials apart. Since on this one
we are all groping in the dark, I feel I should
describe this aspect of nuclear technology
as an unknown risk to a very large number
of people.

I cannot see my way through to a calculus
of the value of human lives in large
numbers, that would help clarify issues of
the scope of those just discussed although
estimates of numbers of lives at risk are
and will remain important. These are
basically problems for judgment, even
though the need for making these judgments
will weigh hard on the people called
upon to make them. But supposing I should
be wrong, let me point to one apparent
paradox to be faced in any attempt to
bring a calculus of the shadow price of
human life to bear on problems with a long
time span.

Suppose one accepts as an ethical principle
that, in balancing risks to human life
in the present and in the future, equal numbers
of lives should receive equal weight.
This would make the present value of the
future human life independent of the time
at which it is lived. However, we have seen
that as long as capital saturation is not attained,


### ---Economics-1979-0-12.txt---
the present value of a standard bundle
of goods in the future decreases as that
future time recedes. Hence the present value
of future life relative to that of future goods
will be much higher than the value of present
life in relation to present goods. It should
not be inferred from this that future decision
makers are assumed or advised to devote
greater resources to safety and health
than the present decision makers, although
the future ones may well want to do this for
reasons of their own. The inference is rather,
I submit, that the present values I have described
reflect a curious mixture of three
ingredients: one intertemporal ethical rule,
present preferences between consumption
and protection, and an assumption about
savings behavior of all generations within
the next fifty years, say. Under these assumptions,
sets of "present values" formed
at successive points in time need not, and
generally will not, be consistent with each
other.

VI. The Empirical Basis of

Quantitative Economics

I now go on to a discussion of the empirical
basis for some of the quantitative
statements that economics contributes to
interdisciplinary studies. I will again illustrate
this question with reference to the
few studies I have chosen as examples. At
the same time I will emphasize the role that
the premises underlying the concept of
equilibrium play in this process.
The premise of profit maximization implies
a subpremise of cost minimization.
I regard that subpremise as fitting reality
more closely than the entire premise. It
underlies the supply side of the MRG study
of future energy technology mixes I have
described.

The premise of maximization of satisfaction
by the consumer can be made more
plausible and more applicable by a further
specification. Applied to energy, it says that
successive equal additions to a consumer's
annual energy end-use budget are worth
less and less to him. Operationally, how
much each successive addition is worth to
him can be measured, for instance, by that
increase in the expenditure for the rest of
his consumption that he would have regarded
as equivalent to each next addition
to his energy consumption.

This specification implies the existence of
a household demand function for energy, in
which per capita demand for energy decreases
as its price increases, and increases
as per capita real income increases. The
MRG extended this concept to the sum of
direct and indirect demand for energy, the
latter being the energy used as input to the
production of all nonenergy goods, including
capital goods as well. Another extension
distinguishes demand for individual
fuels, where the demand for one fuel increases
if the price of another competing
fuel goes up.

These functions are then estimated from
empirical data. In the procedure followed
in the model with the estimated long-run
price elasticity of -.4 mentioned above, a
parametric form of these functions was
fitted to cross-section and time-series data
for seven OECD countries, including the
United States, for the period 1955-72. In
the model with price elasticity -.25 the
estimation procedure was not stated with
comparable explicitness. In both models the
estimated long-run demand functions,
written with price as a function of quantity,
were then integrated to estimate the benefit
from the consumption of energy in all
forms.

By comparison, the empirical basis for
the production side is more direct. Each of
the various competing energy producing,
converting, and using processes is represented
by constant ratios of inputs to outputs,
reflecting operating experience where
available, or based on estimates of such
ratios and of future availability dates for
processes not yet developed. For instance,
process estimates for the years 1985 and
2000 were drawn upon in estimating the
elasticity of substitution between electric
and nonelectric energy in the second of the
two models just discussed. This did constrain
but not by itself imply numerical
estimates of the elasticities of demand for


### ---Economics-1979-0-13.txt---
energy, whether in toto (given as -.25), or
for the two components.

This completes my description of the empirical
basis for the MRG procedures and
the premises on which they rest. I want,
in passing, to draw attention at this point
to the econometric aspects of another
study, designed to estimate perceived benefits
of air quality improvements from residential
property values in areas with different
air quality. The study is entitled "The
Costs and Benefits of Automobile Emission
Controls." It draws on a body of
econometric work in which property values
are related to various characteristics of the
site and the neighborhood, including air
quality and other environmental amenities,
and the income of the household.
The foregoing examples lead me to some
broader remarks on the empirical basis of
quantitative economic knowledge in general,
not limited to the type of studies we
are here mostly concerned with.
In all formal procedures involving statistical
testing or estimation, there are explicitly
stated but untested hypotheses,
often called "maintained" hypotheses by
statisticians. In the econometric studies we
have here considered, the "premises" already
discussed play that role. More in
general, any statement resulting from such
studies retains the form of an "if ... then . . ."
statement. The set of "ifs," sometimes called
"the model," is crucial to the meaning of
the "thens," usually but somewhat inaccurately
called the "findings." For instance,
in fitting demand relations, the principal
maintained hypotheses specify the variables
entering into these relations, and possibly
other variables with which these variables
are in turn linked in other pertinent relations.


The "if ... then ..." statements are similar
to those in the formal sciences. They
read like logical or mathematical reasoning
in the case of economic theory, and like applications
of statistical methods in the case
of econometric estimation or testing. The
heart of substantive economics is what can
be learned about the validity of the "ifs"
themselves, including the "premises" discussed
above. "Thens" contradicted by observation
call, as time goes on, for modification
of the list of "ifs" used. Absence of
such contradiction gradually conveys survivor
status to the "ifs" in question. So I do
think a certain record of noncontradiction
gradually becomes one of tentative confirmation.
But the process of confirmation
is slow and diffuse.

For some purposes, and at considerable
expense, short cuts can be made to diminish
the dependence on untested "ifs." I
am speaking of systematic experiments such
as the so-called negative income tax experiment
conducted in New Jersey over the
period 1968-72, and followed by similar income
maintenance experiments in other
areas of the United States. If one wants to
know whether income maintenance payments
to families near the poverty line have
a disincentive effect, or no effect, or even a
positive incentive effect on labor supply,
one does not need to have a pretested theory
as to what, if anything, the family is maximizing.
Instead, one can make such payments
to a sample of families and compare
its behavior with that of an unaided
control group. This is what the New Jersey
experiment did. In one category of families
where the numbers spoke rather clearlywhite
husband-and-wife whole familiesthe
effect on labor supply was found to be
negative, moderate but statistically significant,
and with the effect on the husband's
labor supply smaller than that on the wife's.
In addition, much was learned about the design,
conduct, and evaluation of such experiments
for use in later studies.

There have not been many such experiments
on a scale needed to obtain statistically
significant outcomes. Moreover,
they have been limited to questions of
great and urgent policy importance. Meanwhile,
we do need to find ways in which
verification of the premises of economics,
through cumulative econometric analyses
and through experiments that find a sponsor,
can be pursued.

I have not found in the literature a persuasive
account of how such confirmation
of premises can be perceived and documented.


### ---Economics-1979-0-14.txt---
How do we keep track of the contradictions
and confirmations? How do we

keep the score of surviving hypotheses?
And what are we doing in those directions?
The same questions have been raised before,
among others by my predecessors,
Wassily Leontief and Robert Aaron Gordon,
and good and bad examples of concern
and unconcern were referred to by
both of them. Meanwhile, unresolved issues,
sometimes important ones from the policy
point of view, and mostly quantitative ones,
drag on and remain unresolved. Do they
have to?

With one exception I am aware of, even
our best college-level introductory texts of
economics do not press these questions.
They teach good reasoning, and describe
the views of leading minds and schools of
thought, present and past, in the field.
Texts in econometrics teach with great care
how to test assumptions and to estimate
parameters, duly emphasizing the crucial
role of the models. What is also needed is
to teach the tested and confirmed statements.


VII. Aphorisms on Interactions
After all I have said about the need for
empirical validation, I owe you a brief report
on my own casual-empirical sample
study of the difficulties of interaction between
scientists, engineers, and economists,
as seen by participants in joint studies.
Rather than classifying and tabulating the
views expressed, I shall let the respondents
speak for themselves. The following is a
selection (by me) of statements, drawn from
my notes, that carried the most punch.
A physical scientist: "Economists are
technological radicals. They assume everything
can be done."

A geologist: "Economists have been
too enthusiastic about deep sea mining.
They think there is more than there is, that
it is easier to get up than it is, and easier to
process than it is."

A development economist: "Scientists
think big. Economists are marginalists.
Scientists don't think in terms of opportunity
cost."

An engineer: "Economics is not dismal
but incomplete. The things missed are very
important."'

A life scientist: "Market imperfection
is more widespread than economists care to
admit."

An economist: "Where economists see
the invisible hand guiding the market place
to produce pretty good outcomes, scientists
see only chaos."

An engineer: "The economic motive is
overrated."

A psychologist: "All the conclusions
that are drawn from the assumption of rationality
can also be drawn from assumptions
of adaptive behavior."

A life scientist: "Economists have great
skill in handling data. However, they tend
to ask only for data, not for concepts and
ideas. Drawing up a model is an interdisciplinary
task."

An engineer: "Economists often use
smooth production functions even when
engineers might be reluctant to do so."
A life scientist: "Many scientists do not
understand discounting."

An engineer: "Economics is the Thermodynarnics
of the Social Sciences. Everything
is deduced from a few simple postulates
without the necessity for knowing
detailed mechanisms."

VIII. Final Remarks

After this instructive intermezzo, allow
me a few final words. I will not be able to
match the brevity and incisiveness we just
savored. However, I do look on the collaboration
of the diverse professions involved
in the newly discovered joint problems
as an important development. To
economists it is a new challenge and a new
frontier. Among the problems themselves
are some of great importance, nationally
and internationally. They deserve the best
effort and talent that can be brought to
bear, within and across the disciplines.
An important talent requiring cultivation
is skill in communication between dislThe

protection into economic analysis.


### ---Economics-1979-0-15.txt---
ciplines. We should begin with the defusing
of jargon. Perhaps some terms should be
explained at first use. To the physicist who
has used calculus on problems going back
to Isaac Newton, it is unexpected to learn
that everything called "marginal" is a first
derivative of something. It appears natural
to him, however, to learn that an "elasticity"
is the dimensionless slope of a curve
plotted on double-log paper. There is more
trouble lying in wait with "externalities,"
an institutional concept presupposing private
property, or at least an accountability
for private or public production or household
decisions that is dispersed over individuals
and organizations. If we will be
more forthcoming with explanations of our
cherished terms, our science colleagues may
be more inclined to help us out with "entropy,
" which to me is a more difficult concept
than anything economics has to offer.
A more serious problem is that, while our
universities are the principal training ground
for future scientists of all kinds, they do not
seem to be the best place for gaining experience
in interdisciplinary interaction. I
believe that the root of the difficulty lies in
the procedures for academic appointment
and promotion. The initiative, the decisive
first step, is usually taken in the department
of one's own discipline. Young faculty
members must prove their worth first to
their senior colleagues in the field they are
identified with. A joint appointment holds
somewhat less promise as a stepping stone
to tenure. Even our graduate students are
already aware of these factors.
The increasing demand for the contributions
of interdisciplinarians may gradually
break the barriers down. Progress will be
slow unless university faculties and administrations
perceive the problem. Once they
do, the irrepressible curiosity and venturesomeness
of our undergraduates will provide
a point at which to start and from
which to build up.
 ## Economics-1980-0


### ---Economics-1980-0-01.txt---
There is a long-standing tension in economics
between belief in the advantages of
the market mechanism and awareness of its
imperfections. 'Ever since Adam Smith,
economists have been distinguished from
lesser mortals by their understanding of and
-I think one has to say-their admiration
for the efficiency, anonymity, and subtlety
of decentralized competitive markets as an
instrument for the allocation of resources
and the imputation of incomes. I think we
all know this; for confirmation one can look
at the results of a paper (James Kearl et al.)
presented at the last annual meeting, reporting
the responses of professional economists
to a sort of survey of technical opinion. The
propositions which generated the greatest
degree of consensus were those asserting the
advantages of free trade and flexible exchange
rates, favoring cash transfers over
those in kind, and noting the disadvantages
of rent controls, interest rate ceilings, and
minimum wage laws.

Views on these policy issues did not seem
to represent mere conservative ideology:
half of the respondents agreed and another
30 percent agreed "with provisions" that
redistribution of income (presumably toward
the poorest) is a legitimate function
of government policy. The profession's reservations
about rent control, interest rate
ceilings, and minimum wage laws do not
appear to reflect a rejection of the goals of
those measures, but rather a feeling that
nonprofessionals simply do not understand
fully the consequences, often unexpected
and undesired, of messing around with the
market mechanism. Most of us are conscious
of a conflict that arises in our minds
and consciences because, while we think it is
usually a mistake to fiddle the price system
to achieve distributional goals, we realize
that the public and the political process are
perversely more willing to do that than to
make the direct transfers we would prefer. If
we oppose all distorting transfers, we end up
opposing transfers altogether. Some of us
seem to welcome the excuse, but most of us
feel uncomfortable. I don't think there is
any very good way to resolve that conflict in
practice.

Simultaneously, however, there is an important
current in economics that focuses
on the flaws in the price system, the ways
that real markets fail because they lack
some of the characteristics that make idealized
markets so attractive. I think that
outsiders, who tend to see economists as
simple-minded marketeers, would be
astonished to learn how much of the history
of modern economic analysis can be written
in terms of the study of the sources of
market failure. The catalog runs from natural
and artificial monopoly, to monopolistic
competition, to the importance of public
goods and externalities of many other kinds,
to-most recently-a variety of problems
connected with the inadequate, imperfect,
or asymmetric transmission of information
and with the likelihood that there will simply
be no markets for some of the relevant
goods and services.

Even the vocabulary can be revealing.
Market "imperfection" suggests- a minor
blemish of the sort that can make the
purchase of "irregular" socks a bargain.
Market "failure" sounds like something
more serious. To take a more subtle example,
I mentioned that one kind of flaw in the
system can be the absence of certain
markets. The common generic term for the
reason why markets are missing is "transaction
costs." That sounds rather minor,
the sort of thing that might go away in
due course as accounting and information


### ---Economics-1980-0-02.txt---
processing get cheaper. But some of the
cases of missing markets really go much
deeper. The fact that distant future generations
can not participate directly in the
markets for nonrenewable resources will not
be remedied by improvements in communication.
Nor are the residents of densely
populated areas ever likely to be able to
dicker effectively with the dozens or hundreds
of sources of barely traceable pollutants
whose health effects, if any, cumulate
over many years.

There is a large element of Rohrschach
test in the way each of us responds to this
tension. Some of us see the Smithian virtues
as a needle in a haystack, as an island of
measure zero in a sea of imperfections.
Others see all the potential sources of
market failure as so many fleas on the thick
hide of an ox, requiring only an occasional
flick of the tail to be brushed away. A
hopeless eclectic without any strength of
character, like me, has a terrible time of it.
If I may invoke the names of two of my
most awesome predecessors as President of
this Association, I need only listen to Milton
Friedman talk for a minute and my mind
floods with thoughts of increasing returns to
scale, oligopolistic interdependence, consumer
ignorance, environmental pollution,
intergenerational inequity, and on and on.
There is almost no cure for it, except to
listen for a minute to John Kenneth
Galbraith, in which case all I can think of
are the discipline of competition, the large
number of substitutes for any commodity,
the stupidities of regulation, the Pareto optimality
of Walrasian equilibrium, the importance
of decentralizing decision making to
where the knowledge is, and on and on.
Sometimes I think it is only my weakness of
character that keeps me from making obvious
errors.

The critics of the mainstream tradition
are mistaken when they attribute to it a
built-in Panglossian attitude toward the
capitalist economy. The tradition has provided
both the foundations for a belief in
the efficiency of market allocations and the
tools for a powerful critique. Economic
analysis by itself has no way of choosing
between them; and the immediate prospects
for an empirically based model of a whole
economy, capable of measuring our actual
"distance" from the contract curve, are
mighty slim. The missing link has to be a
matter of judgment-the Rohrschach test
I spoke of a minute ago. For every Dr.
Pangloss who makes the ink blot out to be
of surpassing beauty, give or take a few
minor deviations-the second-best of all
possible worlds, you might say-there is a
Candide to whom it looks a lot like an ink
blot. Maybe there are more Panglosses than
Candides. But that was true in Voltaire's
time too-just before the French Revolution,
by the way-and has more to do with
the state of society than with the nature of
economics.

The tension between market efficiency
and market failure is especially pointed in
discussions of the working of the labor
market, for obvious reasons. The labor
market connects quickly with everything
else in the economy and its performance
matters more directly for most people than
that of any other market. Moreover, the
labor market's own special pathology, unemployment,
is particularly visible, particularly
unsettling, and particularly frustrating.
The fuse leading from theory to policy in
this field is short, and has been known to
produce both heat and light throughout
much of the history of economics.
Contemporary macro-economic theory,
though apparently full of technical novelties,
has revived many of the old questions
in only slightly different form. One of the
points I want to make is that underneath the
theoretical innovations-some of which are
interesting and important the basic controversial
issues that come to the surface are
the same ones that occupied earlier literature.
The most important among them is
really the old tension between market
efficiency and market failure. Should one
think of the labor market as mostly clearing,
or at worst in the process of quick return to
market-clearing equilibrium? Or should one
think of it as mostly in disequilibrium, with
transactions habitually taking place at nonmarket-
clearing wages? In that case presumably
the wage structure is either not
receiving any strong signals to make it


### ---Economics-1980-0-03.txt---
change in the right direction or is not responding
to the signals it receives. My own
belief in this case lies with the marketfailure
side. That is to say, I believe that
what looks like involuntary unemployment
is involuntary unemployment.

Of course that conclusion only leads to
another question. If the labor market often
fails to clear, we had better figure out why.
There is no shortage of candidate hypotheses.
Here I think it is worthwhile to insist on
a commonplace: although it is natural for
academic people to seek a single weighty
Answer to a weighty Question, if only because
it is so satisfying to find one, it is
quite likely that many of the candidate hypotheses
are true, each contributing a little
to the explanation of labor-market failure.
Now the second general point I want to
make is one that I am surprised to hear
myself making. While I find several of the
candidate hypotheses entirely believable, I
am inclined to emphasize some that might
be described as noneconomic. More precisely,
I suspect that the labor market is a
little different from other markets, in the
sense that the objectives of the participants
are not always the ones we normally impute
to economic agents, and some of the constraints
by which they feel themselves

bound are not always the conventional constraints.
In other words, I think that among
the reasons why market-clearing wage rates
do not establish themselves easily and adjust
quickly to changing conditions are some
that could be described as social conventions,
or principles of appropriate behavior,
whose source is not entirely individualistic.
I said that I am a little surprised at myself.
That is because I am generally stodgy
about assumptions, and like to stay as close
to the mainstream framework as the problem
at hand will allow. In any case, I think
that the unconventional elements in what I
have to say are only part of the story. And I
assure you that I am not about to peddle
amateur sociology to a captive audience. All
I do mean to suggest is that we may predispose
ourselves to misunderstand important
aspects of unemployment if we insist on
modelling the buying and selling of labor
within a set of background assumptions
whose main merit is that they are very well
adapted to models of the buying and selling
of cloth. Far from advocating that we all
practice sociology, I am pleasantly impressed
at how much mileage you can get
from the methods of conventional economic
analysis if only you are willing to broaden
the assumptions a little.

I

It might be interesting to have a history of
the evolution of economic ideas about unemployment,
and their relation both to the
internal logic of the subject and to the
parallel evolution of the institutions of the
labor market. I am not sufficiently well read
to provide that kind of survey. To make my
point about the persistence of the marketefficiency
market-failure tension, I took a
short cut. I went back to reread Pigou's
Lapses from Full Employment, a little book I
remember having been assigned to read as a
student just after the war. And that in turn
sent me back to its parent book, Pigou's
Theory of Unemployment. The Preface to
The Theory of Unemployment is dated April
1933, after a decade of poor performance
and relatively high unemployment in Great
Britain, well into the Great Depression, and
before the publication of the General Theory.
The Preface to Lapses from Full Employment
(another example of a revealing
vocabulary) is dated November 1944, after
five years of the war that put an end to the
depression, and well after the appearance of
the General Theory. That seemed like an
interesting approach to the historical question,
because current controversies in
macro-economic theory are often described
as a debate between "Keynesians" and
others- "monetarists," "Classicals," or
" equilibrium theorists" - and because
Pigou, besides being a great economist, was
in particular the embodiment of the
Marshallian tradition, the leading figure in
the "classical economics" that the Keynesian
revolution was explicitly intended to
overthrow.

Lapses makes interesting rereading. It emphasizes
the money wage, whereas its predecessor


### ---Economics-1980-0-04.txt---
was written almost entirely in terms
of the real wage. The general macro-theoretic
framework, in which the discussion of
the labor market is embedded, clearly has
an eye on Keynes. The underlying model
could be IS-LM without doing much violence
to the argument. There are little
anachronisms: Pigou tends to think of the
interest rate as being determined in the
goods market (by Savings = Investment) and
nominal income as being determined by
the demand for money. Today we take
simultaneity seriously, but the General Theory
more or less speaks as if real output is
determined in the goods market and the
interest rate by liquidity preference. After
what is to me a confusing description
of a Keynesian low-level liquidity-trap
equilibrium, Pigou invokes the Pigou effect
to explain why the low level might not be as
low as all that and then, characteristically,
remarks that none of it is very important in
practice anyway. All this is relevant here
only as background for the treatment of the
labor market.

Pigou says the obvious thing first, and I
agree that it is the first thing to say: if there
is "thorough-going competition" among
workers, then the only possible equilibrium
position is at full employment. That is little
more than a definition of equilibrium. He is
aware that he is taking a lot of dynamics for
granted. Expectations of falling wages could
perversely reduce the demand for labor; and
he discusses the possibility that under some
conditions, with the interest rate at its practical
floor, nominal wage rates and prices
may chase each other down and thus prevent
the real-wage adjustment needed for an
increase in employment. (This is where the
Pigou effect makes its appearance, of
course.)

It is what comes next that interests me. It
is obvious to Pigou, writing in 1944, that the
labor market does not behave as if workers
were engaged in thorough-going competition
for jobs. With the common sense that
seems somehow to have escaped his modem
day successors, he wonders why it does not.
And he discusses three or four of the institutional
factors that a reasonable person
would mention even now as obstacles to the
classical functioning of the labor market.
First of all, he realizes that the labor
market is segmented. Not everyone in it is
in competition with everyone else. I am not
referring here to the obvious fact that abilities,
experience, and skills differ, so that
unemployed laborers can not compete for
the jobs held by craftsmen. That fact of life
merely reminds us that "labor" is not a
well-defined homogeneous factor of production.
Even within skill categories or occupational
groups, however, workers have ties to
localities, to industries, to special job classifications,
even to individual employers.

These ties can be broken, but not easily. It
is interesting to me that even the Theory of
Unemployment of 1933 devotes a lot of space
to the analysis of a labor market in
which there are many "centers of employment"
-to use the neutral term chosen
by Pigou to describe segmentation of the
labor market-between which mobility is
absent or slow. Of course he observes that
even in a completely segmented labor
market, if there is thorough-going competition
within segments, full employment will
be the rule, although there may be wage
differentials between centers of employment
for otherwise identical workers. I think that
the fact of segmentation is very important,
not only because it limits the scope of competition
but because its pervasiveness suggests-
though it can not prove-that habit
and custom play a large role in labor market
behavior. From the prominence that he
gives it, I gather that Pigou might have
agreed.

A second factor, which has been more
often discussed, is trade unionism. Pigou
does not have very much to say about collective
bargaining, but what he says makes
sense.

Of course, these agencies in their decisions
have regard to the general state
of the demand for labour; they will
have no wish to set wage rates so high
that half the people of the country are
thrown out of work. Nevertheless,
there is reason to believe that they do
not have regard to demand conditions
in such degree as would be necessary
to secure, as thorough-going competition
would do, the establishment of
full employment. [ 1945, p. 26]


### ---Economics-1980-0-05.txt---
Later on in the book, Pigou makes an observation
that is not explicitly connected
with collective bargaining. He does connect
it with "actual life" however, and it fits
organized workers very well, and perhaps
others besides:

In periods of expansion employers
might be willing to agree to substantial
advances in wage rates if they
were confident that, when prosperity
ended, they would be able to cancel
them. They know, however, that in
fact this will not be easy, that elaborate
processes will have to be gone
through, and that their work-people
will put up a strong rear-guard action.
.. . In periods of depression

wage-earners, for precisely similar reasons,
hold out against wage reductions,
which they might be ready to

concede if it were not for the difficulty
that they foresee in getting them
cancelled when times improve.... A
widespread desire for 'safety first'
helps to make wage rates sticky.
[1945, p. 48]

These casual remarks raise more questions
than they answer about the determination
of nominal wages by collective bargaining.
The first excerpt can be taken as a redefinition
of full employment when the labor
market is not competitive; the second, however,
advances an account of wage stickiness
and is therefore on a different footing.
It would help to explain the failure of the
labor market to clear on any reasonable
definition, and thus provide a connection
between nominal demand and real output.
The third institutional factor mentioned
by Pigou has also been the subject of much
analysis, past and present: the provision of
unemployment insurance. There are several
channels by which the availability of unemployment
compensation can add to the recorded
amount of unemployment. The

prolongation of search is only the most
obvious. My own impression is that this is
currently a significant factor. As an indication
of the complexity of the issues, let me
just mention here that some recent research
by my colleagues Peter Diamond and Eric
Maskin suggests the possibility that in some
environments search activity conveys a positive
externality. So the optimal search
strategy for the individual might provide
less than the socially optimal amount of
search, and unemployment compensation
could be regarded as a corrective subsidy.
This is a neat twist on the theme of the
counterpoint between market efficiency and
market failure. In any case, it can hardly be
doubted that the unemployment compensation
system is an important determinant of
behavior on both sides of the labor market,
and complicates even the definition of full
employment.

The last comment of Pigou's that I want
to cite is especially intriguing because it is so
unlike the sort of thing that his present day
successors keep saying. Already in the 1933
Theory of Unemployment he wrote: "... . public
opinion in a modem civilized State
builds up for itself a rough estimate of what
constitutes a reasonable living wage. This is
derived half-consciously from a knowledge
of the actual standards enjoyed by more
or less 'average' workers.... Public opinion
then enforces its view, failing success
through social pressure, by the machinery
of... legislation" (p. 255). A similar remark
appears in Lapses. Such feelings about equity
and fairness are obviously relevant to
the setting of statutory minimum wages, and
Pigou uses them that way. I think they also
come into play as a deterrent to wage cutting
in a slack labor market. Unemployed
workers rarely try to displace their employed
counterparts by offering to work for
less; and it is even more surprising, as I
have had occasion to point out in the past,
that employers so rarely try to elicit wage
cutting on the part of their laid-off employees,
even in a buyer's market for labor.
Several forces can be at work, but I think
Occam's razor and common observation
both suggest that a code of good behavior
enforced by social pressure is one of them.
Wouldn't you be surprised if you learned
that someone of roughly your status in the
profession, but teaching in a less desirable
department, had written to your department
chairman offering to teach your courses for
less money? The fact that nominal wage
rates did fall sharply during the early stages
of the depression of the 1930's, and the fact
that the Chrysler Corporation has been able


### ---Economics-1980-0-06.txt---
to negotiate concessions from the UAW certainly
show that wage rates are not completely
rigid. But those very instances seem
to me only to confirm the importance of
social convention in less extreme circumstances.
After all, people have been known
to try to claw their way into a lifeboat who
would never dream of cheating on a lift-line.
I think I have made the case that the most
eminent representative of orthodox economics
in the 1940's was fully aware of the many
obstacles to "thorough-going competition"
among workers, that is, of the many ways in
which the labor market may "fail." In particular,
one cannot under those circumstances
expect the labor market always to
clear. Pigou certainly drew that conclusion.
He says, in the Preface to Lapses: "Professor
Dennis Robertson... has warned me
that the form of the book may suggest that
I am in favour of attacking the problem
of unemployment by manipulating wages
rather than by manipulating demand. I
wish, therefore, to say clearly that this is not
so" (P. v).

Pigou clearly felt the tension between
market efficiency and market failure. Nevertheless,
he did not come down on the side of
market failure, even after the 1930's. The
very title of Lapses from Full Employment
tells us that much. Evidently he concluded
that the tendency of the capitalist economy
to seek (and find) its full-employment
equilibrium was strong enough so that departures
from full employment could be regarded
as mere episodes. Is that surprising?
Well, to begin with, there is no accounting
for Rohrschach tests. One person's ink blot
is another person's work of art. But I think
there is also something more systematic to
be said.

In the Theory of Unemployment, Pigou
gives an elaborate analysis of the short-run
elasticity of demand for labor. He is very
careful: he allows for the elasticity of supply
of complementary raw materials; he allows
for the (presumably very high) price elasticity
of demand for exports; he discusses the
effects of discounting future returns to
labor. It is a masterly attempt to get a grip
on orders of magnitude. It is all based on
the presumption that the only possible starting
point is the elasticity of the marginalproduct-
of-labor curve. Let me remind you
that in the old standby, two-factor CobbDouglas
case, the elasticity of demand for
labor with respect to the real wage is the
reciprocal of the share of capital. Everybody'
s back-of-the-envelope puts the capital
share at 1/4 and the elasticity of demand
for labor at 4. This is not exactly the way
Pigou proceeds, but he reaches the same
conclusion: the initial estimate of the elasticity
is "certain to be (numerically) much
larger than - 1 and may well amount to - 5
or more." There follow some modifications,
but the conclusion remains that in times of
depression, the aggregate elasticity of demand
for labor with respect to the real wage
"cannot, on the least favourable assumption
here suggested, be numerically less than - 3
and may well be larger than -4" except
perhaps in the very shortest run.
For practical purposes, one would want
to know the elasticity of demand with respect
to the nominal wage, taking account
of the likelihood that prices will follow
wages down, at least partially. (Obviously if
product prices fall equiproportionally with
wage rates, as Keynes thought might
happen in unlucky circumstances, the real
wage doesn't move at all and employment
will not improve.)' The details of Pigou's
calculations do not concern us, but his conclusion
does: "... we may... not unreasonably
put the elasticity of the money demand
for labour in times of deep depression at not
less numerically than - 1.5."

If I could believe that, I too could believe
that the labor market generally clears. To
reduce the unemployment rate by 6 percentage
points is to increase employment by
about 6 percent, if we ignore for this purpose
the side effects that go to make up
Okun's Law. If that could be accomplished
by a real-wage reduction of 2 percent, or
even less, that is, by foregoing one year's
normal productivity increase, than I could
imagine that the labor market might easily
'Neither Pigou nor Keynes invoked Kaldor's notion
that prices can be expected to fall faster than wages in
a recession with the resulting rise in real wages providing
the force for recovery from the demand side,
through a distributional shift toward wage incomes
which generate more spending per dollar than other
incomes do.


### ---Economics-1980-0-07.txt---
learn to adjust smoothly to fluctuations in
aggregate demand. I could even imagine
that workers might accept the necessary 4
percent reduction in nominal wages, in the
expectation that half of it would be offset by
lower prices. The trouble is that Pigou's
demand elasticities are way too high. A recent
econometric study by Kim Clark and
Richard Freeman, based on quarterly data
for U.S. manufacturing. 1950-76, puts the
real-wage elasticity of demand for labor at
about one-half, a whole order of magnitude
smaller than Pigou's guess.2 And the ClarkFreeman
work is presented as revisionist, a
counterweight to other estimates that are
typically lower, averaging out at about 0.15
according to a survey by Daniel Hamermesh.
To my mind, smooth wage adjustment
seems intrinsically unlikely in a world
with such a small demand elasticity and
institutions like those sketched earlier.
Nothing I read in the newspapers suggests
to me that 6 percent of nonfrictional unemployment
produces a threat adequate to set
off a quick 12-15 percent fall in the real
wage, or a drop in nominal wage rates twice
as large. Sellers facing inelastic demands
usually try to discourage price cutting; why
should workers be different?

The modern classical school seems curiously
remote from all this. When they try to
explain how the equilibrium volume of employment
can fluctuate as widely as actual
employment does in business cycles, their
only substitute for Pigou's high elasticity of
demand is a high elasticity of supply (of
labor) in the face of a perceived temporary
opportunity for unusual gains, which in this
case reflects wages that differ from average
expected (discounted) future wages. In other
words, People who give the vague impression
of being unemployed are actually engaged
in voluntary leisure. They are taking
it now, planning to substitute extra work
later, because they think, rightly or wrongly,
that current real wages are unusually low
compared with the present value of what the
labor market will offer in the future. They
may be responding to changes in real wages
or to changes in the real interest rate.
It is astonishing that believers have made
essentially no effort to verify this central
hypothesis. I know of no convincing evidence
in its favor,3 and I am not sure why it
has any claim to be taken seriously. It is
hardly plausible on its face. Even if the
workers in question have misread the future,
they are merely mistaken, not confused or
mystified about their own motives. It is thus
legitimate to wonder why the unemployed
do not feel themselves to be engaged in
voluntary intertemporal substitution, and
why they queue up in such numbers when
legitimate jobs of their usual kind are
offered during a recession.4

When they face the market-clearing issue
at all, Pigou's successors take a rather abstract
line. They regard it as inherently incredible
that unexploited opportunities for
beneficial trade should be anything but
ephemeral-which means merely that they
ignore all those human and institutional
facts of which Pigou was aware. Or else they
argue that one cannot believe in the failure
of markets to clear without having an
acceptable theory to explain why that
happens. That is a remarkable precept when
you think about it. I remember reading once
that it is still not understood how the giraffe
manages to pump an adequate blood supply
all the way up to its head; but it is hard to
imagine that anyone would therefore conclude
that giraffes do not have long necks.
At least not anyone who had ever been to a
zoo. Besides, I think perfectly acceptable
2The Clark-Freeman estimates are based on quarterly
data for aggregate U.S. manufacturing. Their
difference from other work appears to rest on allowing
wage changes to operate with a lag different from other
factor prices. According to their results the lag of
employment behind wage changes is quite short; it is
complete in about two quarters.
3Just after writing those words, I received a working
paper by Robert Hall which (a) concludes that the
elasticity of supply of labor required to make the intertemporal-
substitution hypothesis work is actually in the
ballpark suggested by other facts, but (b) rejects the
whole theory on other empirical grounds. I have done
some further experimentation on Halls data (with the
help of Mr. Sunil Sanghvi) with results that cast doubt
on the reliability of even the first conclusion. On reflection,
I stand by the words in the text.
4I have tried to phrase that carefully. For some
direct evidence, see "Jobs and Want Ads: A Look
Behind the Evidence," Fortune, Nov. 20, 1978.


### ---Economics-1980-0-08.txt---
theories can indeed by constructed, as soon
as one gets away from foolishly restrictive
and inappropriate assumptions.
II

That brings me to the second and last
general point I had hoped to make. Suppose
one chooses to accept the apparent evidence
of one's senses and takes it for granted that
the wage does not move flexibly to clear the
labor market. By the way, my own inclination
is to go further and claim that commodity
prices are sticky too, at least downward.
But it is the persistence of disequilibrium in
the labor market that I want to emphasize.
How can we account for it?

There is, as I mentioned at the beginning,
a whole catalog of possible models of the
labor market that will produce the right
qualitative properties. Since I have surveyed
this literature elsewhere, I will just list a
half-dozen possibilities now, with the reminder
that they are not mutually exclusive
alternatives.

(1) There is Keynes's idea that caseby-
case resistance to wage reductions is the
only way that workers can defend traditional
wage differentials in a decentralized
labor market. The net result is to preserve
the general wage level or its trend, but that
is an unintended artifact.

(2) There is a complementary hypothesis
about the behavior of employers that I
have proposed myself: if employers know
that aggressive wage cutting in a buyer's
market may antagonize the remaining work
force, hurt current productivity, and make it
harder to recruit high-quality workers when
the labor market tightens, they will be less
inclined to push their short-run advantage.
(3) Pigou realized that widely held notions
of fairness, enforced by social pressure
or by legislation, might have to be part of
any serious account of wage determination.
George Akerlof has pursued this trail further,
documented the prescription of codes
of good behavior in manuals of personnel
practice, and showed formally that such
codes of behavior can be self-enforcing if
people value their reputations in the community.
Obviously there are no Emily Post
manuals to consult as regards the behavior
of laid-off workers, but you would certainly
not be astonished to learn that self-esteem
and the folkways discourage laid-off workers
from undercutting the wages of their
still-employed colleagues in an effort to displace
them from jobs. Reservation wages
presumably fall as the duration of unemployment
lengthens; but my casual reading
suggests that this pattern shows up more in
a willingness to accept lower-paid sorts of
jobs than in "thorough-going competition"
for the standard job. The cost to the worker
of this sort of behavior is diminished by the
availability of unemployment insurance. It
is worth remembering that the acceptance of
lower-grade jobs is itself a form of unemployment.


(4) I need only touch on the AzariadisBaily-
Gordon implicit-contract theory, because
it has been much discussed in the
literature. Here wage stability is a vehicle by
which less-risk-averse firms provide income
insurance for more-risk-averse workers, presumably
in exchange for a lower average
wage.5 It is now understood that the theory
works well only when workers have some
source of income other than wages, unemployment
compensation for instance. This is
not really a disadvantage in a world with
well-developed unemployment insurance
systems. In any case such implicit contracts
do not themselves account for unemployment.
Their effect is to reduce the average
amount of unemployment below the level
that would occur in a simple spot market.
The theory belongs in my list because I
suspect it does help to account for the habit
of wage inertia and therefore the vulnerability
of employment to unexpected fluctuations
in aggregate demand.

(5) Wherever there is collective bargaining
in our economy, the standard pattern,


### ---Economics-1980-0-09.txt---
with few exceptions, is that wage rates are
specified in the contract, and the employer
chooses the amount of employment. This is
not exactly simple monopoly, because the
union cannot set the wage schedule unilaterally.
To the extent that it can, another
source of wage stickiness can be identified.
Under a reasonable assumption about what
the union maximizes, it turns out that the
only aspect of the demand for labor that has
any effect on the monopoly wage is its elasticity.
So if the demand curve for labor
shifts down nearly isoelastically in a recession,
the contractual wage will change little
or not at all, and the full effect of the fall in
demand will bear on employment. The
amount of unemployment compensation
available plays a role here too. (There is
much more to be said along these lines,
and Ian McDonald of the University of
Melbourne and I hope to say it on another
occasion.)

(6) As a last example, I recall Pigou's
observation that wage changes may be
seen by the parties as hard to reverse without
a struggle whose duration and outcome
cannot be foreseen. The resulting uncertainty
causes employers to drag their feet
when demand increases temporarily and
workers to reciprocate when demand falls.
The result is wage stickiness in the face of
fluctuating employment.

Only what Veblen called trained incapacity
could prevent anyone from seeing that
some or all of these mechanisms do indeed
capture real aspects of the modern capitalist
economy. Assessing their combined significance
quantitatively would be a very difficult
task, and I do not pretend to be able
to do that. We are all interpreting this ink
blot together. Obviously I would not be
giving this particular talk if I did not think
that wage stickiness is a first-order factor in
a reasonable theory of unemployment.
To make my position plausible, I want to
try to summarize the sort of general characteristics
that the labor market should have
if the particular mechanisms that I have
enumerated are to be important. By the
way, I have no reason to believe that my list
is anything like exhaustive; you may think
of others. Simply to narrow the field, I have
deliberately left out of account factors relating
specifically to age, sex, race, and other
characteristics that normally form the basis
for discussions of structural unemployment
as distinct from cyclical unemployment.
The sort of labor market I have in mind is
segmented. It often makes sense to think of
an employer or definable group of employers
as facing its own labor pool. Some
members of the labor pool may be unemployed,
but still belong to it. Although
transportation, information, and transaction
costs are possible sources of segmentation,
they need not be among the most important.
The buildup of firm-specific or industryspecific
human capital may be more fundamental,
and equally a kind of mutual knowing-
what-to-expect that gives both parties in
the labor market a stake, a rent, in the
durability of the relationship. This point is
close to the distinction between auction
markets and customer markets made by
Arthur Okun in a different context. The
labor market, at least the "primary" labor
market, is a customer market; this may be
one of the important facts that differentiates
the primary from the secondary labor
market.

A second general characteristic is the
availability of some nontrivial source of
nonemployment income. The obvious one is
unemployment compensation, but I imagine
that fringe activity ranging from hustling to
home maintenance can function in much
the same way. I suppose in some societies
the possibility of returning temporarily to
farming is now as important as it once was
here. The presence of a second earner in the
family can make an obvious difference. One
consequence is that it becomes easier to
maintain a labor pool in the presence of
fluctuating employment. In addition, as I
mentioned a few moments ago, several of
the specific sticky-wage mechanisms in my
catalog depend for their operation on this
characteristic.

Third, the stability of the labor pool
makes it possible for social conventions to
assume some importance. There is a difference
between a long-term relationship
and a one-night stand, and acceptable behavior
in one context may be unacceptable
in the other. Presumably most conventions
are adaptive, not arbitrary, but adaptiveness


### ---Economics-1980-0-10.txt---
may have to be interpreted broadly, so as to
include pecuniary advantage but not be
limited by it. Critics who deride the notion
of "economic man" have a point, but usually
the wrong point. Economic man is a
social, not a psychological, category. There
are activities in our culture in which it is
socially acceptable and expected that individual
pecuniary self-interest will be the
overriding decision criterion: choosing a
portfolio of securities, for example.6 There
are others in which it is not: choosing a
mate, for example.7 The labor market is
more complicated than either, of course,
and contains elements of both. Perhaps in
nineteenth-century Manchester labor was
bought and sold by "thorough-going competition"
but I think that is unlikely to be a
good approximation to contemporary wage
setting. In particular, as I have emphasized,
there is nothing in the data or in common
observation to make you believe that moderate
excess supply will evoke aggressive
wage cutting on either side of the labor
market.

In

I draw two conclusions from this whole
train of thought, one about economics and
the other about the economy.

About economics: it -need not follow
that we old dogs have to learn a lot of new
tricks. It still seems reasonable to presume
that agents do the best they can, subject to
whatever constraints they perceive. But in
some contexts the traditional formulations
of the objective function and constraints
may be inappropriate. In the labor market,
the participants are firms and groups of
firms on one side, and individual workers,
organized trade unions, and informally
organized labor pools on the other. Grant
me that all feel constrained, to some nontrivial
degree, by social customs that have to
do with the wage and wage-setting procedures.
The result is that factor prices turn
up in our equations in unfamiliar ways. Let
me just mention a few examples from my
earlier list of hypotheses. If Keynes was
right about the conventional significance of
relative wages, then ratios of wage rates
appear in the objective functions on the
labor side. If the current or future performance
of workers depends on their feelings
that wage levels are fair, then wage rates
appear in the production functions constraining
firms. If the individual worker's
utility function depends quite conventionally
on current income, then the collective
objective function of a labor pool of identical
workers might reasonably be a weighted
average of the utility of the wage and the
utility achievable when unemployed, with
weights equal to the employment and unemployment
fractions. This objective function
contains both wage and volume of employment
as arguments; and it has the interesting
property that the marginal rate of
substitution between wage rate and employment
can depend very sensitively on the size
of the unemployment insurance benefit.
Constrained maximization and partial or
complete reconciliation in the market can
still be the bread and butter of the macro
theorist. Spread with more palatable behavior
assumptions, they may make a tastier
sandwich, and stick to the ribs.
About the economy: if the labor market
is often not in equilibrium, if wages are
often sticky, if they respond to nontraditional
signals, then there is a role for macro
policy and a good chance that it will be
effective. Equilibrium theories that conclude
the opposite may conceivably turn out to
have the right answer, but they simply
assume what they purport to prove. It is not
my argument that standard textbook policy
prescriptions are bound to be right. That
has to be worked out case by case. All I do
claim is that a reasonable theory of economic
policy ought to be based on a reasonable
theory of economic life.

The early debates over the role of government
in economic life, at least during the
era of industrialization, took the form of a
contest between laissez-faire and thoroughgoing
socialism. In Western Europe and
North America, however, the movement
away from individualism followed a much
less radical course, which John Maynard
Keynes was one of the first to define. His
famous lectures in the mid-1920's on The
End of Laissez-Faire carried the following
passage:

... a time may be coming when we
shall get clearer than we are at present
as to when we are talking about
Capitalism as an efficient or inefficient
technique, and when we are talking
about it as desirable or objectionable
in itself. For my part, I think that
Capitalism, wisely managed, can probably
be made more efficient for attaining
economic ends than any alternative
yet in sight, but that in itself it
is in many ways extremely objectionable.
Our problem is to work out a

social organization which shall be as
efficient as possible without offending
our notions of a satisfactory way of
life. [p. 53, emphasis added]

Keynes, as we can now see, was among
the first writers to form a definite vision of
the kind of system under which we have
come to live during the last half century, the
system we now call the Mixed Economy or
Welfare Capitalism or the Middle Way. Like
the much more individualistic, much less
guided, system that preceded it, the Mixed
Economy developed with the support of a
broad consensus of opinion. That consensus,
however, has now weakened. The
economic role of government is again the
subject of debate, attack, and resistance far
more intense than we have known for decades.
The attack ranges over a wide spectrum.
It questions the scope of government,
the particular measures and policies through
which government exercises its functions,
and the political institutions which shape
the measures and policies employed. A few
voices call on us to move on to a more encompassing
socialism, including the ownership
of industry. Many more call for a drastic
revival of market rule.

We all, I think, sense that we have come
to a very difficult juncture in the development
of our Mixed Economy. How we shall
emerge is still in dim prospect. As in other
illnesses, social crises often are surmounted
and are followed by periods of renewed
stable development. But sometimes not. We,
therefore, ought to think where we are and
what the nature of our troubles is.
I

There is no single, simple way to gather
together all the threads of our present discontent,
and I shall not try. One useful
opening, however, is to consider the pronounced
and worrisome retardation of productivity
growth from which we now suffer.
Productivity growth, I need hardly say, is
the main source of measured per capita
output growth. And per capita output, in
turn, is a central component of economic
welfare as we economists conceive it, many
would say the central component. It is elementary,
however, that per capita output
growth and welfare growth are not the same
thing. National product is not even an adequate
long-term measure of net output relevant
to welfare. It makes inadequate allowance


### ---Economics-1981-0-04.txt---
for the quality and variety of goods.
It excludes the household and treats all
government expenditure as final product. It
neglects the externalities of production and
consumption and the costs of growth proper,
for example, the dislocation of people. It
makes dubious assumptions about people's
ability to appraise and guard against the
dangers carried by jobs and products. And
there is much more to economic welfare
than can be captured in any long-term measure
of output: job stability; income security,
a fair distribution of opportunities and
rewards.

The economic role of government expanded
during the last half century and
more in large part in order to pursue the
social objectives that are not comprehended
in measured net national product. The result
is the mixed economy or welfare state in
which we now live and which is now the
object of attack.

Productivity growth is a useful focus of
discussion in relation to the current discontents
and the accompanying reappraisal of
our mixed economy for a combination of
two reasons.

To begin with, productivity, viewed as a
source of private earnings, exists in a state
of uneasy tension with the other welfare
objectives, which we pursue largely through
the government. The causes of the tension
need to be underscored.

First-an obvious point-the more income
that is diverted to social uses, the less
of any given aggregate remains under the
private control of income earners for their
own personal use.

Next, the size of the diversion and the
way it is made and used affects the level of
output and productivity, present and future.
That is partly because a host of government
activities are supportive of current output
and productivity, and many activities, including
some, like education, that are undertaken
for generalized social objectives,
are in the nature of capital formation.' In a
still more basic sense, moreover, and one
much neglected in current debates, the pace
of growth in a country depends not only on
its access to new technology, but on its
ability to make and absorb the social adjustments
required to exploit new products and
processes. Simply to recall the familiar, the
process includes the displacement and redistribution
of populations among regions and
from farm to city. It demands the abandonment
of old industries and occupations, and
the qualification of workers for new, more
skilled occupations. The extension of education,
with all its implications for shifts in
social status, in aspiration, and in political
power, is a requisite. Along the technological
path which we have followed, growth
also demands very large-scale enterprise
which establishes new types of market power
and alters the relations of workers and employers.
Viewed from another angle, the dependent
employment status of workers and
the mobility of industry and people imply a
great change in the structure of families and
in their roles in caring for children, the sick,
and the old. Because the required adaptations
can and do alter the positions, prospects,
and power of established groups,
conflict and resistance are intrinsic to the
growth process. To resolve such conflict and
resistance in a way which preserves a large
consensus for growth, yet does not impose a
cost which retards growth unduly, a mechanism
of conflict resolution is needed. The
national sovereign state necessarily becomes
the arbiter of group conflict and the mitigator
of those negative effects of economic
change which would otherwise induce resistance
to growth.2

The enlargement of the government's economic
role, including its support of income
minima, health care, social insurance, and
the other elements of the welfare state, was,
therefore-at least up to a point-not just a
question of compassionate regard for the
unfortunate, and not just a question of reducing
inequalities of outcome and opportunity,
though that is how people usually
think of it. It was, and is-up to a point-a


### ---Economics-1981-0-05.txt---
part of the productivity growth process itself.


And yet, manifestly, there is another side
to the story, the side that is so much to the
fore today. The government's roles as referee
and as mitigator of the costs of growth- as
well as instrument for pursuing welfare goals
supplementary to measured productivitymust
be paid for. But it is essentially impossible
to design a tax system that places no
marginal burden on the rewards for productive
effort, or a regulatory system that has
no cost in measured output. Similarly, we
can hardly design a transfer system whichup
to a point-necessarily divorces income
from work, but which yet does not qualify
economic incentives. There is a presumption,
therefore, that the tax-transfer-regulatory
system, whatever its essential, longterm,
indirect, supportive role, operates more
immediately and directly to constrict work,
saving, investment, and mobility-just how
much is, of course, a question.
There is, therefore, an uneasy manyfaceted
tension between measured productivity
growth and the private earnings it
generates on the one side, and the pursuit of
other welfare goals through government on
the other side. The tension implies a difficult
and delicate problem of choice and
balance. A balance-certainly a wide acceptance
of the pace and nature of our joint
pursuit of different welfare goals- seemed
to exist during the first two postwar decades
when productivity growth was relatively
rapid. That balance, if it was a balance,
has, however, now been upset by the protracted
retardation of productivity growth
during the last dozen or more years. That is
the second reason why productivity growth
is a useful focuis for examining the current
dissatisfaction with our mixed economy.
I shall deal briefly with three matters:
1) What were the developments which
were antecedent to (which stand in the
background of) our present troubles and its
accompanying discontent?

2) What can we now say about the
causes of the current productivity retardation?
In particular, to what extent is the
retardation connected with the enlarged role
of government and its pursuit of alternative
social goals?

3) What is the outlook for productivity
growth, and what are the implications of
that outlook for the further development of
our mixed economic system?

II

In the early part of the postwar period,
economic growth, in the aggregate and per
capita, established itself as a premier goal of
economic policy-co-equal with "full" employment,
perhaps of even higher priority.
Besides the standard reason, that per capita
growth raises average levels of consumption,
there were special reasons. Growth was seen
as the best way to overcome poverty without
the social conflicts accompanying redistribution.
It would create a favorable environment
in which to open opportunities for
blacks and other minorities. It would provide
the resources for meeting still other
social goals, for example, extended education
and health care. Growth was also sought
to maintain defense, to compete politically
with a fast-growing Soviet Union and to
assert continued leadership in our rapidly
progressing alliance. Growth would enable
us to help not only the poor in our own
country, it would permit us to help the still
more impoverished people of the lessdeveloped
world. Productivity growth was a
goal distinguishable from full employment,
but it was also seen-not necessarily correctly-
as a condition of full employment.
Unless we could hold our own in international
trade, our foreign accounts would impose
demand restraints on policy and make
for chronic underemployment.

This growth, so ardently desired, was in
fact achieved. For two decades, income per
capita grew faster than ever before and output
per hour much faster. At the same time,
there was a rapid development of government
in pursuit of other welfare objectives,
and this was also eagerly sought. The Social
Security system established in the 1930's
was enlarged; education was rapidly extended;
science was fostered; there were
large programs for hospital building and
housing. The proportion of the population
living below defined poverty levels was


### ---Economics-1981-0-06.txt---
reduced- the joint result of rising average
incomes, and extended insurance and welfare
provision. Partly because government
was bigger, partly because the scope of progressive
taxation was wider, partly because
of old age and unemployment insurance and
other forms of income maintenance, we
enjoyed the benefits of a system of "built-in
stabilizers." Recessions were milder and
growth more steady than they had ever been
before in American experience as an
industrialized country.

The main point, however, is that in this
period, productivity growth paid easily for
the pursuit of other welfare goals. Although
government grew faster than GNP, fast
growth of productivity supported fast growth
of per capita disposable income, of real
spendable earnings of workers, and of average
family incomes.3 Productivity growth
was, therefore, the substantial basis on which
the consensus of opinion supporting the
development of the mixed economy rested.
III

Frank Knight liked to say that progress is
not a question of happiness; it is a question
of what people are unhappy about. Not
surprisingly, therefore, the progress of the
first two postwar decades was followed by a
certain recoil from growth-a reordering, if
not reversal, of priorities. This took several
forms:

1) Whereas in the 1950's, measured growth
was regarded as the main instrument for
overcoming poverty, as the 1960's wore on
the view took hold, with much justification,
that future growth alone could not deal adequately
with the poverty which past growth
had left behind. Although technical progress,
capital accumulation, and general education
would continue to be important in
the future, an increasing proportion of the
"residual poor" had special handicaps. They
had to be helped directly, principally by a
fight against discrimination, by special education
and training programs, and by new
and expanded schemes for social insurance,
income support, health care programs, and
other transfers in kind. The impulse to fight
poverty directly was fed by new information
about the size and composition of the remaining
poor population, by the indignation
of social reformers and, most of all, by
rising racial tensions.4 "We cannot," said
the Council of Economic Advisors, "leave
the further wearing away of poverty solely
to the general progress of the economy"
(1964, p. 60).5

2) As individual income levels rose, people
generally became more sensitive to their
immediate surroundings. They found hospital
and educational facilities inadequate
and the urban physical plant shabby. Yet
the demand for improvement had to be met
in difficult circumstances which continue to
plague and torment local government to this
day. The relative price of public, like that of
private, services was rising. Higher incomes
and automobiles were transporting upwardly
mobile families to the suburbs, carrying
their tax base with them. The cities,
increasingly abandoned to the poor, unable
to tap the suburban affluence about them,
could barely cope. Congestion on the highways
and streets, noise, air and water pollution,
all fed by growth itself, swelled, moved
to the countryside and everywhere became
more objectionable to otherwise more affluent
people.

3) People discovered the terrors of technology-
products, working conditions, and
environmental changes that carried risks.
The dangers feared were often invisible, they
operated at a distance and cumulated over
time, carrying both real and imaginary
threats to health and life now and in generations
to come. Technological progress, which
for decades had been seen as the process by
which problems and dangers might be overcome,
was now increasingly feared as a
major source of our troubles.

These shifts in outlook had two important
practical consequences. One was the very


### ---Economics-1981-0-07.txt---
rapid expansion of government social welfare
and civil rights programs which began
in the mid-1960's and which developed and
matured in the 1970's. Expenditures for "social
welfare," which were 9 percent of GNP
in 1950 and only 10 percent in 1960, rose to
15 percent in 1970 and to 20 percent in
1977.6 The other was "explosion" of public
regulatory legislation and administration directed
to the protection of the environment,
and to the safety of workers and consumers.7
The new legislation became the basis for
strong, privately organized campaigns to
limit growth and the application of new
technology.

IV

The maturing of the Great Society programs
in the spheres of welfare and civil
rights, and the implementation and expansion
of the social regulatory laws, brought
our mixed economy to a new stage of development.
There was a new distribution of
emphasis among the different dimensions of
economic welfare, and correspondingly a
new distribution of economic power between
the private and public spheres. The
new development of the mixed economy,
however, is now confronted by a changed
and less-favorable growth environment.
Looking back, we can now see that a
slower rate of productivity growth accompanied
the institution and the maturing of the
Great Society programs. To what extent the
two developments were associated as effect
and cause, however, is still an open question.
So is a related matter; that is, the
responsibility of transient as distinct from
durable factors for bringing about the
slowdown we observe. It would be wrong to
pretend that there are now definite answers
to these questions. The factual position,
however, deserves description because it
bears on the origins of our present discontents.


Beginning in the late 1960's, private-sector
productivity growth fell back from the high
speed it had reached in the years preceding.
The retardation before 1973 was moderate.
The new pace approximated that during the
somewhat slack later 1950's. After 1973,
however, the slowdown became much more
serious. The upshot is that average productivity
growth for the fourteen years between
1965 and 1979 ran at only one-half the pace
of the years from 1948 to 1965; since 1973,
it has risen at less than one-fifth that earlier
pace.8 The extent of the slowdown between
the two rough halves of the postwar period,
before and after 1965-to say nothing of
the post-1973 period by itself-may be
judged from the fact that the post-1965 productivity
slowdown has been more severe

than any of the retardations measured across
major depressions going back to the 1890's.
That includes the retardation from the 1920's
to the 1930's.9 Yet, up to 1979 we had had
no major depression.

In my judgment, the productivity retardation,
at least since 1973, has been accompanied
by a slower rate of improvement in
material conditions of well-being. In some
respects, and by some measures, there have
even been significant declines. It is true that,
because the labor force was rising rapidly in
relation to population, the growth rate of
real disposable income per capita was well
maintained-at least if we depend on the
deflator for "personal consumption expenditures"
; not if we use the CPI. As perceived
by many people, however, the welfare sig-
6See U.S. Social Secuxity Administration. Social
welfare expenditures cover social insurance, public
assistance, health and medical care, veterans' programs,
education, housing and "other." At present, exhaustive
expenditures accdunt for nearly half and transfer
programs for somewhat more than half of total welfare
expenditures. (See Sheldon Danziger, Robert
Haveman, and Robert Plotnick, pp. 6-8.) The major
reasons for the accelerated growth since 1965 appear to
lie in the initiation and expansion of new programs,
such as Medicare, and in the generous increase of
benefit schedules in old programs like Social Security
(see Plotnick, pp. 277-78).

7The Federal Register, which records new regulations,
contained 10,000 pages in 1953, but 65,000 pages
in 1977. The federal budget to administer regulatory
activities was $5 billion in 1978, having doubled since
1974. Compare Arthur Bums, p. 4.
8I depend for these comparisons on the easily accessible
Bureau of Labor Statistics figures for "output per
hour of all persons" in the private business sector. See
Economic Report of the President (1980, Table B-37).
9See Appendix Table 1.


### ---Economics-1981-0-08.txt---
nificance of even the more favorable measure
is qualified. That is partly because the
demographic changes that supported laborforce
growth also made for a faster increase
of households than of population, so to some
degree expenses per head increased with income
per head.' It is qualified also to the
extent that women felt forced to take paid
work to offset the slower rise or actual decline
of their husbands' real earnings; to the
extent that the proportion of persons living
in pretransfer poverty has been tending to
rise since 1968; to the extent that transfer
incomes became a more important part of
aggregate disposable income- to the disadvantage
of income earners; and to the extent
that the rise of noncash compensation
reduced worker's discretionary take-home
pay. The upshot is that in recent years, the
average real cash incomes of workers have,
depending on the measure, almost ceased to
rise or begun to fall. The same is true of the
average real total income of families, supported
as that has been by transfer incomes
and by the entry of second workers. The
presumption is that the real earned income
of representative single worker families, still
more their cash income, has definitely
declined."

The slowdowns in the growth rates of
productivity, annual wages, and household
incomes are, moreover, not the only disturbing
elements in our economic situation. They
are accompanied by rapid and volatile inflation
which redistributes income and wealth
in arbitrary and confusing ways. Taken together,
these developments have disappointed
peoples' expectations; they have
robbed many people of the fruits of earlier
work and saving, and made almost everyone
unsure or fearful about their future.
These developments stand in the background
of the current discontent with the
operation of our mixed economy. They have
led to a blacklash against the earlier recoil
from productivity growth. This blacklashperhaps
justifiably, perhaps not-raises
sharply the issue of maintaining a steady
balance between the productivity growth
that supports the rise of earned incomes and
the pursuit of other vitally important social
goals.

V

Our attitudes towards that issue would be
clearer if we could know to what extent the
current productivity retardation is actually
due to the workings of our mixed economy
or to its past and current attempts to raise
social welfare through government actions.
Many believe that the welfare and regulatory
programs are heavily implicated both
in direct ways and because of their arguably
plausible connection with the onset and persistence
of an erratic and accelerating inflation.
There is a concomitant fear that the
welfare and regulatory programs may be a
serious drag on future productivity growth.
Opposition to these programs, is, therefore,
rising. True, if future productivity growth is
slow for whatever reasons, people will be
less willing than they might otherwise be to
bear the cost of pursuing alternative welfare
goals. But if that pursuit were actually a
significant cause of slower growth, the reluctance
would be still stronger, as it then
should be.

The causes of the current retardation,
however, remain cloudy. A portion of the
slowdown is, by general agreement, due to a
virtual cessation of the shift of workers from
small-scale inefficient farming and from
self-employment in petty trade to higher
productivity occupations in larger- scale
urban enterprise. A portion too is assignable
to the massive entry of workers-youth and
women-since the mid-1960's. Finally, a
small part of the retardation is attributable
to the diversion of resources to comply with
environmental regulation and safety requirements
in ways that do not register in
measured output, though, of course, they


### ---Economics-1981-0-09.txt---
should. Serious students, however, offer
widely different estimates of the contributions
of other factors: the quality of schooling,
conventional capital services, R&D, and
the influence of cyclical or other forces affecting
intensity of resource use. The impact
of higher energy prices on the substitution
of labor for capital in the operation of existing
energy-using equipment and on the
post-1973 slowdown of capital deepening is
equally unclear, though possibly very important.
Most analyses leave a substantial
part of the retardation unconnected with
any identified and measured contributory
source, and they disagree about the timewhether
after 1973 or as early as the latter
1960's-when that unspecified residual retardation
made its appearance.'2

In this state of factual uncertainty, it is
not hard to propose estimates of the sources
of retardation which assign substantial responsibility
to factors connected with the

government's welfare and regulatory activities.
We, therefore, find William Fellner asking:
"...whether, directly or indirectly [the
analyses of the retardation] do not suggest
that the weakening of the productivity trend
is attributable in part to changes in the
socio-political environment that are of recent
origin or that have cumulated to a
'critical mass"' (p. 4).

The suggested mode of operation of these
factors is, first, through a decline in the rate
of capital deepening; second, through a decline
of worker effort symptomized by absenteeism
and by a drop in hours worked

relative to hours paid; third, by a disinclination
for risky, innovatory effort, whose
manifestation is the observed slowdown in
the residual measures of total factor productivity
growth; and fourth, through the diversion
of resources to regulatory compliance,
the benefits of which do not register in
measured output even when they should.
These sources of retardation whether great
or small-the "suspects," as Fellner calls
them-are arguably associated with characteristic
features of our mixed economy,
even if they are not exclusively due to them.
The first of those features is the widening
difference between before- and after-tax
marginal rates of return to work, saving,
investment, and risk taking. The magnitude
of the rise in these rates is indicated by the
overall increase of total government expenditures
from 20 percent of GNP in

1947-49 to 28 percent in 1963-65 and again
to over 32 percent in 1977-79.13 The incentive
effects of the tax increases are still imperfectly
understood, but there is little
reason to suppose they are not distinctly
unfavorable.'4 Allied to the effects of rising
tax burdens is the possible effect of the
cumulating "social security wealth" of individuals
on savings and that of other insurance
and income-support programs on
work.'5 Next, there are the effects of burgeoning
regulatory activity. These go beyond
the direct resource costs of compliance
already mentioned. There are also indirect
costs and risks of obtaining administrative
and judicial clearance for new projects, the
diversion of R&D expenditure to meet environmental
and safety standards, and the

hazards of possible future changes in regulatory
requirements. Finally, there are the
manifold effects of erratic and accelerating
inflation.

'3The large effect shown in Feldstein's original,
much-noticed time-series analysis (1974) has been
thrown into doubt by the discovery of a flaw in his
computer program. In a forthcoming NBER working
paper, he now finds a smaller but still significant effect.
Such time-series estimates remain uncertain because it
is hard to measure expected Social Security benefits
and hard to separate the effects of Social Security
wealth on saving from those of other variables during
periods of relative stability, as in samples covering the
postwar years alone. The conclusion that Social Security
benefits work to reduce saving, however, is sup-
ported by other studies, based on samples of individual
households and on cross-country evidence, to which
Feldstein refers in his new working paper.


### ---Economics-1981-0-10.txt---
Inflation belongs in this litany because
our pursuit of alternative welfare goals has
thus far also involved a tolerance, indeed a
pressure, for chronic budgetary deficits, and
an understandable political incapacity to
employ monetary and fiscal restraint forcefully
and consistently at the risk of elevated
unemployment. Inflation, in conjunction
with tax rules and accounting practices designed
for a stable price regime, has meant
very high marginal taxes on returns to
capital. In the judgement of some public
finance experts, it has also meant a differential
burden on business investment compared
with that on household borrowing,
spending, and investing.'6 If there are fears
of accelerated inflation in the future, they
carry the prospect of still higher taxes and
lower returns while the erratic nature of
rapid inflation makes the future more difficult
to discern and increases the sense of
risk. And if the same fears give rise to a
vision of price controls, the risks of investment
and innovation are compounded. In
any event, inflation compels- or threatens
to compel-governments to reduce capacity
utilization below its potential. Therefore
inflation acts to diminish one of the inducements
to invest, as the 1980 business contraction
following on financial disorder illustrates.
We should remember, moreover,

that there is an element of vicious circularity
in this aspect of our present conjecture. Inflation
has deleterious effects on productivity
growth-and unexpected declines in
productivity growth exacerbate inflation.
This range of considerations leads some
students to the view that the pursuit of
alternative welfare goals accounts for a very
considerable part of the retardation. Fellner,
whom I mentioned before, suggests that "the
causes of at least 1 percentage point annual
slackening of the trend in output per
worker's hour can be found among the 'suspects"
' (p. 10). That loss is equal to one-half
the observed difference between the privatesector
productivity growth since 1973 and
that during the quarter century between 1948
and 1973.

Such numbers and the argument that leads
to them should be understood to be no more
than what they are-a prima facie indication
that something very substantial may be
involved in the choices we make between
productivity growth and alternative welfare
goals. I would not mention them if I did not
fear that there is much to the problem, if
not as a cause of the recent abrupt retardation,
then as a longer-term secular constraint.
Yet, at the present time the argument
is only speculative, and the estimated
loss still more so. The theoretical and
quantitative issues are unsettled and deserve
our most urgent attention.'7

So much for the past. We must now try to
look ahead. What general view of the future
is it sensible to entertain? And what are its
implications?

Since our understanding of the productivity
retardation of the last dozen years is so
clouded, conjecture about the future must
be still more fuzzy. True, the negative impact
of the recent big influx of inexperienced
young workers is due to be reversed.
In looking ahead, however, more basic questions
need to be addressed. No one, indeed,
ought to doubt the persistence of some
substantial continuity in what Solomon
Fabricant has identified as

the basic factors underlying economic
growth in the United States: the tastes
and preferences of the American people,
the economic opportunities and
alternatives open to them, the social
framework within which they live and
work together, and the relations of the
United States with the rest of the
world. Different assumptions would be
contrary to all experience and could
only lead to wild speculation. [So he
concludes] The trend of national output
per worker-hour will ... continue to
be upward. [p. 1]

I agree; but, as Fabricant also asks, how
fast will the trend line rise? A "substantial
degree of continuity" is not the same as
ironclad fixity, and much of this talk has
already pointed to some change in
Fabricant's basic factors. Within the country,
preferences and goals have changed in
the degree to which concern for income
security, equality of opportunity, environmental
protection, and consumer and worker
safety sways votes and, to some degree, personal
behavior. Corresponding to these shifts
in tastes and concerns, the "social framework
within which we live and work together"
has been recast. The government
has come to play a larger role in shaping the
"economic opportunities and alternatives"
open to us-while imposing burdens on our
growth potential whose weight we can now
suspect but cannot yet clearly assess. Partly
because of higher incomes, partly because
of changes in industrial and labor market
organization, and partly because of government
regulation and income support, there
has been a decline in market flexibility-in
the responsiveness of prices and wages to
the balance of supply and demand, and
of people's own responsiveness to price
changes-the implications of which Tibor
Scitovsky sketched last year.

Our relations with the rest of the world
have also changed in ways which I believe
are dominantly, but not entirely, unfavorable
to U.S. growth prospects. The economic
rise of Europe and Japan has, indeed,
brought those countries to the technological
after 1973, namely, the great increase in the price of
energy and the rapid, accelerating, and erratic inflation.
Our mixed economy is then implicated to the extent
that it works to sustain, if not generate, inflation, and
to the extent that our welfare concerns impede the
formulation and execution of an energy policy consistent
with the maintenance and rapid rise of measured
productivity. Continuing work may well clear up
these questions about the responsibility of public policy
for the current retardation, but, for the time being, we
have to live with uncertainty.
The puzzle is still further confused by the experience
of the continental European countries. Their fiscal
burdens are on the whole heavier than those of the
United States, yet their productivity retardation does
not generally begin before the oil shock of 1973-74
and the aggravated inflationary disorders that followed.
One must, therefore, ask whether the longer persistence
of high European productivity growth rates did not
reflect a difference in "cyclical" experience. Unlike the
United States, they did not generally enjoy a cyclically
induced intensification of resource use in the early
1960's and, therefore, a cyclical acceleration of productivity
growth. They had no occasion, therefore, to suffer
a cyclical retardation in the latter 1960's, as the United
States may have done as our economy approached
capacity utilizatidn. We may also ask whether the
Europeans were more resistant to the incentive effects
of heavy taxes and large transfers because of the special
factors supporting their great postwar growth
booms; or perhaps because their tax and transfer systems
are designed differently than ours; or perhaps
because of still other matters that differentiate their
economies and societies from our own. Or is it the case
that what I have referred to as the "suspect factors"-
other than inflation and monetary disorder itself-have
little to do with the observed retardations of productivity
growth? Clearly, the theoretical and empirical issues
embodied in these questions call for our very urgent
attention.


### ---Economics-1981-0-12.txt---
frontier in many fields. On that account, the
effort and experience on which world technological
advance rests now has a wider

base. The United States, therefore, should
now begin to profit more from other countries'
technical effort even as other countries
borrow from us. It remains to be seen, of
course, whether we shall prove as successful
at borrowing and adapting foreign technology
as some other countries have been.
The advance of other countries, however,
also has a darker side for us. The development
of many industries in which this country
has long been a leader is now threatened
by the competition of other countries. This
changes the prospects for U.S. productivity
growth to our disadvantage. It is harder for
an industry to push forward, or even to keep
up with, the technological frontier when its
rate of expansion slows down, still harder
when it is contracting. It is an old story that,
in the course of aggregate productivity
growth, the rise of new, more rapidly progressing
industries constricts the growth of
the old. That is Schumpeter's "creative destruction,
" and it helps explain why retardation
in the growth of output and productivity
is the normal fate of individual industries
within a country, while the growth rate of
the aggregate remains constant or even
speeds up. The reverse, however, is not necessarily
true, nor even probably true. We
cannot count on new, more progressive sectors
stepping into the breach merely because
the development of our old industries is
constricted by foreign competition. Foreign
success, of course, offers us cheap imports.
Yet the experience of Britain from 1870 to
1913 presents this country with a worrisome
historical question mark. As Britain's basic
industries lost their leadership and markets
to the United States, Germany, and other
countries after 1870, Britain's labor productivity
growth rate was halved compared with
previous decades, and her average total factor
productivity growth during the forty
years after 1870 fell to zero.'8 The question
is: Can we mount a more energetic and
successful response to the challenge of newly
rising foreign competitors after 1970 than
Britain did after 1870?19

The relative decline of U. S. economic and
political power carries with it other disadvantages,
and not for ourselves alone. The
leadership of the United States in the liberalization
and stabilization of international
economic relations was one of the bases for
rapid world-wide productivity growth in the
postwar years. We were able to assert that
leadership because superabundant economic
strength permitted us to propose arrangements
beneficial to ourselves but generous
to other countries, and because dominant
political power persuaded sometimes recalcitrant
partners to cooperate. Today, with
U.S. influence reduced and U.S. as well as
European industries under pressure, the
world economy is threatened by a resurgence
of protectionism, in which this country
is itself taking part. The world-wide price
discipline, which a relatively stable U. S
monetary policy imposed through the dollar-
exchange standard, has, for the time
being, been lost. And with U.S. influence
diminished, effective international cooperation
in the petroleum market and in other
aspects of relations between industrialized
and developing countries has been beyond
our reach.

In these circumstances, it is just as difficult
to maintain a vision of an unbroken 3


### ---Economics-1981-0-13.txt---
percent trend rate of private-sector productivity
growth as it is to discard a vision of a
trend rate which continues to be significantly
positive. It should, therefore, be no
surprise that official and other responsible
projections foresee productivity growth rates
that lie above zero, but significantly below
the average postwar rate.20

The uncertainty surrounding any such
forecasts can hardly be overstated. The
progress of science and the enlargement of
the knowledge bases of technology go on
apace. Our problem is to overcome or mitigate
the forces that are checking our ability
to give our growing knowledge practical application
and to exploit its benefits fully.
There are both physical and monetary sides
to our present condition which make our
prospects particularly perplexing. On the
physical side is the new energy question.
Quite apart from the policies we pursuewhich
may themselves be of crucial importance-
we do not now know on what terms
supplies will be available, even so far as they
depend only on physical and technological
considerations. We are uncertain about the
elasticity of substitution between energy and
other resources, and we do not know how
much technological progress will itself be
impeded as we try to move along a lessenergy-
intensive path than we have followed
in the past. The spread of industrialization
from Europe and North America to Asia
and Latin America also raises questions
about the supplies of other primary materials.
As for money, so long as we prove
incapable of overcoming our present disposition
to inflation, we shall not be able to
reach and exploit what would otherwise be
the growth potentials of our economy. But if
we ever do regain a substantial degree of
price stability, we may be happily surprised,
even as the Stagnationists of the 1930's were
astonished by our growth performance in
the postwar period.

VII

In spite of these uncertainties and whatever
pleasant or gloomy surprises they may
hold, we can hardly avoid the present presumption
that our policy choices in the
calculable future will need to be made in a
less favorable growth environment than that
of the generation just past. Our problem of
choice will be all the more aggravated if, as
now seems likely, the burden of defense
expenditures must increase.

That means, first, that our further pursuit
of social welfare goals will have to be paid
for out of smaller increments of output and
income. So, there will be a more difficult
problem of choice even if our growth rate
itself were not affected by what we choose.
It means, second, that the impact of our
choices on the measured growth rate itself
becomes a more pressing concern and may
go far to determine whether the projections
now entertained are, indeed, ratified by history
or belied. The new, more confined
growth environment means, third, that the
role of government as a contributor to measured
productivity will also be more vitally
important, not merely insofar as the government
may act to minimize its regulatory or
fiscal impact on private performance, but
also in the support it gives to research, education,
information, labor mobility, and to
human capital formation generally.
As we think about these questions, we
should not be trapped in the grooves of
popular debate. As already said, the alternative
paths to economic progress do not present
us with clear-cut choices between
welfare through government production
guidance and income redistribution on the
one side, and welfare through private productivity
growth on the other. Even if we
cared for little except the private use of
private earnings, we could not ignore the
costs and conflicts arising from the economic
and social displacements which
accompany growth. We could not, for
20For example, in its 1979 Economic Report of the
President, the Council of Economic Advisors estimated
the current trend rate of advance of labor productivity
in the national economy at 1.5 percent a year, corresponding
to 1.75 percent in the private sector, which
is little more than half the postwar pace. In its 1980
Report, moreover, the Council writes: "Since the average
rate of increase during the past 6 years has been
below that figure [of 1.5 percent], the trend rate of
increase [in the national economy] may very well be
still lower, perhaps 1 percent" (p. 88). For further
discussion and other projections, see Fabricant (pp.
63 ff.).


### ---Economics-1981-0-14.txt---
example, disregard problems which the
changing structure and role of the family
bring in their train. The state of our cities
with all their problems of poverty, crime
and deteriorating education, and all their
exposure to the pressures of racial concentration
and frustration, should be a sufficient
reminder. All are bound up with the
productivity growth process itself. They are
sources of antagonism, conflict, and decline
of personal quality which will work to constrain
growth unless moderated.

VIII

In the new, less-favorable growth environment,
the tensions between productivity and
other welfare goals are screwed several
notches tighter. The success of our mixed
economy and pluralistic society in the next
generation will depend heavily on how those
tensions are managed. In present circumstance,
therefore, economic progress turns
very largely on the policies we pursue, on
what we do through government, and how
we do it. As things now stand, however, we
can hardly be said to be adopting policies so
much as floundering among them, recoiling
from growth and backlashing against the
recoil, for lack of knowledge and for lack of
proper political institutions to use such
knowledge as we have.

The gaps in our knowledge define the job
for economics. Virtually every facet of the
way productivity depends on policy involves
matters of fact still to be established. What
is the elasticity of substitution between energy
and other resources, and how much
will it cost us in future output if we forego
the cheapest mode of increasing energy supplies
in order to provide a greater degree of
protection for environment and people?
What are the full benefits and what are the
full costs of other environmental or safety
measures as now legislated and applied? And
how much could we save if we sought similar
levels of protection more efficiently by
making larger use of market incentives as
regulatory devices? What are the effects of
different levels and-just as importantdifferent
types of taxes and transfers on the
supplies of saving, investment, and risky
enterprise, and on the supply of labor and
the quality of people? What is the full range
of our government expenditure which has
the character of capital formation-and
what are the returns to investment in education
and in research and development? What
would our progress in productivity look like
if we tracked it by a system of national
accounts more relevant to long-term change
in economic welfare than our conventional
national product? The questions go on and
on. These are matters to which, for the most
part, economists have only recently turned.
They are now being attacked with vigor,
which is testimony to the fact that the aggravated
tension between measured productivity
growth and other welfare goals is
eliciting a constructive response. There are
promising beginnings of useful analytical
and empirical work, and these will benefit
from future experience and experiment. At
the same time, our knowledge about this
entire range of questions continues to be
uncertain.

The weakness of our knowledge, moreover,
is matched, probably exceeded, by the
weakness of the political institutions and
procedures through which that knowledge
must be brought to bear. The structure of
government and politics, which served us
well enough during a more individualistic
era and before the population movements of
the last fifty years, has not been successfully
adapted to the new scale and complexity of
public functions. Let me just allude to three
political problems.

One concerns federal budget procedure.
In principle, the budget is the place where
the conflicting claims of special interests
should confront, not only one another, but
also the general interest in economy and in
maintaining a balance between private and
public uses of income. It is also the place
where our concern for increasing welfare by


### ---Economics-1981-0-15.txt---
raising measured productivity should be
brought into balance with our interest in
other welfare goals. But our budgetary process,
in spite of improvements in recent
years, remains weak. Tolerance for deficits
is the overt, inflation is the covert, mode by
which competing claims are reconciled. For
lack of a systematic way of facing the future
costs of present acts, three-quarters of the
budget consists of "uncontrollable" items.
Capital investment is not distinguished from
current consumption. We have just begun to
recognize that regulatory acts impose private
costs of compliance, analogous to excise
taxes, which must somehow be brought
within the budgetary ambit of the public
household.

A second matter is what, by pleasant euphemism,
is called our system of local

government. Fractionated geographically
and functionally and poorly coordinated,
operating in a confused relation to the
federal government, plagued by financial
crisis reflecting in part the disjunction between
the populations they serve and the tax
bases on which they rest, our towns, cities,
and districts are fertile generators of external
costs, duplicative and costly regulation,
and chronic neglect. If, as historians generally
agree, Britain could not have carried
through its Industrial Revolution without
the great Victorian reforms of local government,
we ought to be asking whether we can
meet the emerging problems of growth and
welfare in the second half century of our
mixed economy without also facing up to
the need for systematic local government
reform.

The third matter is both basic and diffuse,
and that is the weakness of our party system.
It is a commonplace that our national
parties are no more than fluid, transistory,
and undisciplined coalitions of regional
and economic interest groupings. Their lack
of central organization and authority, reflecting
the size and diversity of the country
and people, and our lack of ideological
commitment, lays us wide open to the distorting
influence of special-interest lobbies
and single issue politics. In our political life,
we are all too vulnerable to particularistic
pressures and all too resistant to the needs
of general interest legislation.
Ix

The rationale supporting the development
of our mixed economy sees it as a pragmatic
compromise between the competing virtues
and defects of decentralized market capitalism
and encompassing socialism. Its goal
is to obtain a measure of distributive justice,
security, and social guidance of economic
life without losing too much of the allocative
efficiency and dynamism of private enterprise
and market organization. And it is a
pragmatic compromise in another sense. It
seeks to retain for most people that measure
of personal protection from the state which
private property and a private job market
confer, while obtaining for the disadvantaged
minority of people through the state
that measure of support without which their
lack of property or personal endowment
would amount to a denial of individual freedom
and capacity to function as full members
of the community.

The viability, to say nothing of the success,
of this compromise demands a rough, threecornered
balance between the degree to

which we look for economic progress
through the development of our powers of
production by private action, the degree to
which we try through government to protect
and promote those aspects of production
which markets do not reach, and the degree
to which we use governments to alter and
cushion the market's income verdicts and to
resolve the social conflicts which are inherent
in growth and change. Until recently, we
have paid inadequate attention to the requirements
of achieving that balance wisely.
We were able to neglect the problem because
we enjoyed the amplitude of a run of
fortunate years, when rapid and steady
growth was the unseen moderator of the
tensions of balance. In the new and less
favorable environment of growth, however,
the tensions between productivity and the
alternative dimensions of welfare are aggravated
and the problems of balance-of
how much to do and how to do it- are
more severe.

In the last analysis, values- feelings,
tastes, and sympathies- control choices. But
those feelings and sympathies should not


### ---Economics-1981-0-16.txt---
have to be deployed with the sad deficiencies
of knowledge which, in so many spheres,
is the case today. Nor should we have
to bring feelings and knowledge to bear
through political institutions and procedures
which are as imperfect as those through
which we -now act.

When Keynes spoke of the potential efficiency
of a "wisely managed" capitalism,
he was assuming that the knowledge necessary
for wise management was either in
hand or would be forthcoming. But he did
not seem to be thinking about the limitations
of the political process in bringing
knowledge to bear. Now that economists
and other social scientists have begun to
work at it, we can be cautiously hopeful that
our knowledge about both the tradeoffs and
the complementarities between productivity
growth and the other dimensions of economic
welfare will gradually improve. For
the calculable future, however, our limited
political capabilities may well prove to be
the most binding constraint on our ability to
work out a social organization which, as
Keynes said, "shall be as efficient as possible
without offending our notions of a
satisfactory way of life."

Contemplating these obdurate realities,
what can one say to conclude this talk on an
upbeat note? The best I can do is a somewhat
inspirational passage from a lecture by
Jacob Viner, who, as we all know, was no
flaming New Dealer, no Great Society man,
and no Keynesian. I am fond of this passage,
not only because of its sturdy determination,
but also because it displays so
well Viner's precise but involuted mind, and
his amiable weakness for the nonstop
sentence. At the close of a long critique of
the American welfare state, which is the
mixed economy I have been talking about,


### ---Economics-1981-0-17.txt---
Viner says:

For all these reasons, ... there is in the
abstract no reason for making an idol
of the welfare state in its American
form or for dedicating ourselves unreservedly
to its continuance as it is today
without qualification or amendment.
Given the... imperfection of the
procedures whereby it deals with problems
which it cannot evade or defer or
with problems which special interests
may press upon it for premature resolution,
it would be only by the dispensation
of a benevolent Providence

that it would ever make precisely the
right decisions or always avoid major
mistakes. It does not have theoretical
superiority over all conceivable alternative
systems.... If ... I nevertheless
conclude that I believe that the welfare
state, like old Siwash, is really worth
fighting for and even dying for as
compared to any rival system, it is
because, despite its imperfections in
theory and in practice, in the aggregate
it provides more promise of preserving
and enlarging human freedoms,

temporal prosperity, the extinction
of mass misery, and the dignity of
man and his moral improvement than
any other social system which has previously
prevailed, which prevails

elsewhere today or which, outside
Utopia, the mind of man has been
able to provide a blueprint for.

The address of the departing president is
no place for modesty. Nevertheless, I must
resist the temptation to describe the analysis
I will report here as anything like a revolution.
Perhaps terms such as "rebellion" or
"uprising" are rather more apt. But, nevertheless,
I shall seek to convince you that the
work my colleagues, John Panzar and Robert
Willig, and I have carried out and encapsulated
in our new book enables us to look at
industry structure and behavior in a way that
is novel in a number of respects, that it
provides a unifying analytical structure to
the subject area, and that it offers useful
insights for empirical work and for the formulation
of policy.

Before getting into the substance of the
analysis I admit that this presidential address
is most unorthodox in at least one significant
respect-that it is not the work of a single
author. Here it is not even sufficient to refer
to Panzar and Willig, the coauthors of both
the substance and the exposition of the book
in which the analysis is described in full. For
others have made crucial contributions to the
formulation of the theory-most notably
Elizabeth Bailey, Dietrich Fischer, Herman
Quirmbach, and Thijs ten Raa.

But there are many more than these. No
uprising by a tiny band of rebels can hope to
change an established order, and when the
time for rebellion is ripe it seems to break
out simultaneously and independently in a
variety of disconnected centers each offering
its own program for the future. Events here
have been no different. I have recently received
a proposal for a conference on new
developments in the theory of industry structure
formulated by my colleague, Joseph
Stiglitz, which lists some forty participants,
most of them widely known. Among those
working on the subject are persons as well
known as Caves, Dasgupta, Dixit, Friedlaender,
Grossman, Hart, Levin, Ordover,
Rosse, Salop, Schmalensee, Sonnenschein,
Spence, Varian, von Weiszacker, and
Zeckhauser, among many others.' It is, of
course, tempting to me to take the view that
our book is the true gospel of the rebellion
and that the doctrines promulgated by others
must be combatted as heresy. But that could
at best be excused as a manifestation of the
excessive zeal one comes to expect on such
occasions. In truth, the immediate authors of
the work I will report tonight may perhaps
be able to justify a claim to have offered
some systematization and order to the new
doctrines-to have built upon them a more
comprehensive statement of the issues and
the analysis, and to have made a number of
particular contributions. But, in the last
analysis, we must look enthusiastically upon
our fellow rebels as comrades in arms, each
of whom has made a crucial contribution to
the common cause.

Turning now to the substance of the theory,
let me begin by contrasting our results
with those of the standard theory. In offering
this contrast, let me emphasize that much of
the analysis rests on work that appeared
considerably earlier in a variety of forms.


### ---Economics-1982-0-04.txt---
We, no less than other writers, owe a heavy
debt to predecessors from Bertrand to Bain,
from Cournot to Demsetz. Nevertheless, it
must surely be acknowledged that the following
characterization of the general tenor of
the literature as it appeared until fairly recently
is essentially accurate.

First, in the received analysis perfect competition
serves as the one standard of welfare-
maximizing structure and behavior.
There is no similar form corresponding to
industries in which efficiency calls for a very
limited number of firms (though the earlier
writings on workable competition did move
in that direction in a manner less formal
than ours).

Our analysis, in contrast, provides a generalization
of the concept of the perfectly competitive
market, one which we call a "perfectly
contestable market." It is, generally,
characterized by optimal behavior and yet
applies to the full range of industry structures
including even monopoly and oligopoly.
In saying this, it must be made clear that
perfectly contestable markets do not populate
the world of reality any more than perfectly
competitive markets do, though there
are a number of industries which undoubtedly
approximate contestability even if
they are far from perfectly competitive. In
our analysis, perfect contestability, then,
serves not primarily as a description of reality,
but as a benchmark for desirable
industrial organization which is far more
flexible and is applicable far more widely
than the one that was available to us before.
Second, in the standard analysis (including
that of many of our fellow rebels), the properties
of oligopoly models are heavily dependent
on the assumed expectations and reaction
patterns characterizing the firms that
are involved. When there is a change in the
assumed nature of these expectations or reactions,
the implied behavior of the oligopolistic
industry may change drastically.
In our analysis, in the limiting case of
perfect contestability, oligopolistic structure
and behavior are freed entirely from their
previous dependence on the conjectural variations
of incumbents and, instead, these are
generally determined uniquely and, in a
manner that is tractable analytically, by the
pressures of potential competition to which
Bain directed our attention so tellingly.
Third, the standard analysis leaves us with
the impression that there is a rough continuum,
in terms of desirability of industry
performance, ranging from unregulated pure
monopoly as the pessimal arrangement to
perfect competition as the ideal, with relative
efficiency in resource allocation increasing
monotonically as the number of firms expands.


I will show that, in contrast, in perfectly
contestable markets behavior is sharply
discontinuous in its welfare attributes. A
contestable monopoly offers us some presumption,
but no guarantee, of behavior consistent
with a second best optimum, subject
to the constraint that the firm be viable
financially despite the presence of scale
economies which render marginal cost pricing
financially infeasible. That is, a contestable
monopoly has some reason to adopt the
Ramsey optimal price-output vector, but it
may have other choices open to it. (For the
analysis of contestable monopoly, see my
article with Elizabeth Bailey and Willig, Panzar
and Willig's article, and my book with
Panzar and Willig, chs. 7 and 8.)
But once each product obtains a second
producer, that is, once we enter the domain
of duopoly or oligopoly for each and every
good, such choice disappears. The contestable
oligopoly which achieves an equilibrium
that immunizes it from the incursions of
entrants has only one pricing option-it must
set its price exactly equal to marginal cost
and do all of the things required for a first
best optimum! In short, once we leave the
world of pure or partial monopoly, any contestable
market must behave ideally in every
respect. Optimality is not approached gradually
as the number of firms supplying a
commodity grows. As has long been suggested
in Chicago, two firms can be enough
to guarantee optimality (see, for example,
Eugene Fama and Arthur Laffer).
Thus, the analysis extends enormously the
domain in which the invisible hand holds
sway. In a perfectly contestable world, it
seems to rule almost everywhere. Lest this


### ---Economics-1982-0-05.txt---
seem to be too Panglossian a view of reality,
let me offer two observations which make it
clear that we emphatically do not believe
that all need be for the best in this best of all
possible worlds.

First, let me recall the observation that
real markets are rarely, if ever, perfectly contestable.
Contestability is merely a broader
ideal, a benchmark of wider applicability
than is perfect competition. To say that contestable
oligopolies behave ideally and that
contestable monopolies have some incentives
for doing so is not to imply that this is even
nearly true of all oligopolies or of unregulated
monopolies in reality.

Second, while the theory extends the domain
of the invisible hand in some directions,
it unexpectedly restricts it in others.
This brings me to the penultimate contrast I
wish to offer here between the earlier views
and those that emerge from our analysis.
The older theoretical analysis seems to have
considered the invisible hand to be a rather
weak intratemporal allocator of resources, as
we have seen. The mere presence of unregulated
monopoly or oligopoly was taken to be
sufficient per se to imply that resources are
likely to be misallocated within a given time
period. But where the market structure is such
as to yield a satisfactory allocation of resources
within the period, it may have seemed that it
can, at least in theory, do a good job of
intertemporal resource allocation. In the absence
of any externalities, persistent and
asymmetric information gaps, and of interference
with the workings of capital markets,
the amounts that will be invested for the
future may appear to be consistent with
Pareto optimality and efficiency in the supply
of outputs to current and future generations.
However, our analysis shows that where
there are economies of scale in the production
of durable capital, intertemporal contestable
monopoly, which may perform relatively
well in the single period, cannot be
depended upon to perform ideally as time
passes. In particular, we will see that the
least costly producer is in the long run
vulnerable to entry or replacement by rivals
whose appearance is inefficient because it
wastes valuable social resources.
There is one last contrast between the
newer analyses and the older theory which I
am most anxious to emphasize. In the older
theory, the nature of the industry structure
was not normally explained by the analysis.
It was, in effect, taken to be given exogenously,
with the fates determining, apparently
capriciously, that one industry will
be organized as an oligopoly, another as a
monopoly and a third as a set of monopolistic
competitors. Assuming that this destiny
had somehow been revealed, the older
analyses proceeded to investigate the consequences
of the exogenously given industry
structure for pricing, outputs, and other decisions.
2

The new analyses are radically different in
this respect. In our analysis, among others,
an industry's structure is determined explicitly,
endogenously, and simultaneously
with the pricing, output, advertising, and
other decisions of the firms of which it is
constituted. This, perhaps, is one of the prime
contributions of the new theoretical analyses.
I. Characteristics of Contestable Markets
Perhaps a misplaced instinct for melodrama
has led me to say so much about
contestable markets without even hinting
what makes a market contestable. But I can
postpone the definition no longer. A contestable
market is one into which entry is
absolutely free, and exit is absolutely costless.
We use "freedom of entry" in Stigler's sense,
not to mean that it is costless or easy, but
that the entrant suffers no disadvantage in
terms of production technique or perceived
product quality relative to the incumbent,
20f course, any analysis which considered the role of
entry, whether it dealt with perfect competition or monopolistic
competition, must implicitly have considered
the determination of industry structure by the market.
But in writings before the 1970's, such analyses usually
did not consider how this process determined whether
the industry would or would not turn out to be, for
example, an oligopoly. The entry conditions were studied
only to show how the assumed market structure could
constitute an equilibrium state. Many recent writings
have gone more explicitly into the determination of
industry structure, though their approaches generally
differ from ours.


### ---Economics-1982-0-06.txt---
and that potential entrants find it appropriate
to evaluate the profitability of entry
in terms of the incumbent firms' pre-entry
prices. In short, it is a requirement of contestability
that there be no cost discrimination
against entrants. Absolute freedom of
exit, to us, is one way to guarantee freedom
of entry. By this we mean that any firm can
leave without impediment, and in the process
of departure can recoup any costs incurred
in the entry process. If all capital is salable
or reusable without loss other than that corresponding
to normal user cost and depreciation,
then any risk of entry is eliminated.
Thus, contestable markets may share at
most one attribute with perfect competition.
Their firms need not be small or numerous
or independent in their decision making or
produce homogeneous products. In short, a
perfectly competitive market is necessarily
perfectly contestable, but not vice versa.
The crucial feature of a contestable market
is its vulnerability to hit-and-run entry. Even
a very transient profit opportunity need not
be neglected by a potential entrant, for he
can go in, and, before prices change, collect
his gains and then depart without cost, should
the climate grow hostile.

Shortage of time forces me to deal rather
briefly with two of the most important properties
of contestable markets-their welfare
attributes and the way in which they determine
industry structure. I deal with these
briefly because an intuitive view of the logic
of these parts of the analysis is not difficult
to provide. Then I can devote a bit more
time to some details of the oligopoly and the
intertemporal models.

A. Perfect Contestability and Welfare
The welfare properties of contestable
markets follow almost directly from their
definition and their vulnerability to hit-andrun
incursions. Let me list some of these
properties and discuss them succinctly.
First, a contestable market never offers
more than a normal rate of profit-its economic
profits must be zero or negative, even
if it is oligopolistic or monopolistic. The
reason is simple. Any positive profit means
that a transient entrant can set up business,
replicate a profit-making incumbent's output
at the same cost as his, undercut the incumbent'
s prices slightly and still earn a
profit. That is, continuity and the opportunity
for costless entry and exit guarantee that
an entrant who is content to accept a slightly
lower economic profit can do so by selecting
prices a bit lower than the incumbent's.
In sum, in a perfectly contestable market
any economic profit earned by an incumbent
automatically constitutes an earnings opportunity
for an entrant who will hit and, if
necessary, run (counting his temporary but
supernormal profits on the way to the bank).
Consequently, in contestable markets, zero
profits must characterize any equilibrium,
even under monopoly and oligopoly.
The second welfare characteristic of a contestable
market follows from the same argument
as the first. This second attribute of
any contestable market is the absence of any
sort of inefficiency in production in industry
equilibrium. This is true alike of inefficiency
of allocation of inputs, X-inefficiency, inefficient
operation of the firm, or inefficient
organization of the industry. For any unnecessary
cost, like any abnormal profit, constitutes
an invitation to entry. Of course, in
the short run, as is true under perfect competition,
both profits and waste may be present.
But in the long run, these simply cannot
withstand the threat brandished by potential
entrants who have nothing to lose by grabbing
at any opportunity for profit, however
transient it may be.

A third welfare attribute of any long-run
equilibrium in a contestable market is that
no product can be sold at a price, p, that is
less than its marginal cost. For if some firm
sells y units of output at such a price and
makes a profit in the process, then it is
possible for an entrant to offer to sell a
slightly smaller quantity, y - E, at a price a
shade lower than the incumbent's, and still
make a profit. That is, if the price p is less
than MC, then the sale of y - E units at price
p must yield a total profit X + A7r which is
greater than the profit, va, that can be earned
by selling only y units of output at that price.
Therefore, there must exist a price just
slightly lower than p which enables the entrant
to undercut the incumbent and yet to


### ---Economics-1982-0-07.txt---
earn at least as much as the incumbent, by
eliminating the unprofitable marginal unit.
This last attribute of contestable equilibria
-the fact that price must always at least
equal marginal cost-is important for the
economics of antitrust and regulation. For it
means that in a perfectly contestable market,
no cross subsidy is possible, that is, no
predatory pricing can be used as a weapon of
unfair competition. But we will see it also
has implications which are more profound
theoretically and which are more germarte to
our purposes. For it constitutes half of the
argument which shows that when there are
two or more suppliers of any product, its
price must, in equilibrium, be exactly equal
to marginal cost, and so resource allocation
must satisfy all the requirements of first best
optimality.

Indeed, the argument here is similar to the
one which has just been described. But there
is a complication which is what introduces
the two-firm requirement into this proposition.
p < MC constitutes an opportunity for
profit to an entrant who drops the unprofitable
marginal unit of output, as we have just
seen. It would seem, symmetrically, that p >
MC also automatically constitutes an opportunity
for profitable entry. Instead of selling
the y-unit output of a profitable incumbent,
the entrant can now offer to sell
the slightly larger output, y + e, using the
profits generated by the marginal unit at a
price greater than marginal cost to permit a
reduction in price below the incumbent's.
But on this side of the incumbent's output,
there is a catch in the argument. Suppose the
incumbent is a monopolist. Then output and
price are constrained by the elasticity of
demand. An attempt by an entrant to sell
y + e rather than y may conceivably cause a
sharp reduction in price which eliminates the
apparent profits of entry. In the extreme case
where demand is perfectly inelastic, there
will be no positive price at which the market
will absorb the quantity y +? . This means
that the profit opportunity represented by
p > MC can crumble into dust as soon as
anyone seeks to take advantage of it.
But all this changes when the market contains
two or more sellers. Now p > MC does
always constitute a real opportunity for profitable
entry. The entrant who wishes to sell a
bit more than some one of the profitable
incumbents, call him incumbent A, need not
press against the industry's total demand
curve for the product. Rather, he can undercut
A, steal away all of his customers, at least
temporarily, and, in addition, steal away e
units of demand from any other incumbent,
B. Thus, if A and B together sell Ya + Yb > Ya'
then an entrant can lure away Ya + -> Ya
customers, for - sufficiently small, and earn
on this the incremental profit e( p - MC)>O.
This means that the entrant who sells Ya + e
can afford to undercut the prevailing prices
somewhat and still make more profit than an
incumbent who sells Ya at price p.
In sum, where a product is sold by two or
more firms, any p > MC constitutes an irresistible
entry opportunity for hit-and-run entry
in a perfectly contestable market, for it
promises the entrant supernormal profits
even if they accrue for a very short period of
time.

Consequently, when a perfectly contestable
market contains two or more sellers,
neither p < MC nor p > MC is compatible
with equilibrium. Thus we have our third
and perhaps most crucial welfare attribute of
such perfectly contestable markets- their
prices, in equilibrium, must be equal to
marginal costs, as is required for Pareto optimality
of the "first best" variety. This, along
with the conclusion that such markets permit
no economic profits and no inefficiency in
long-run equilibrium, constitutes their critical
properties from the viewpoint of economic
welfare. Certainly, since they do enjoy
those three properties, the optimality of perfectly
contestable equilibria (with the reservations
already expressed about the case of
pure monopoly) fully justifies our conclusion
that perfect contestability constitutes a
proper generalization of the concept of perfect
competition so far as welfare implications
are concerned.

B. On the Determination of Industry
Structure

I shall be briefer and even less rigorous in
describing how industry structure is determined
endogenously by contestability


### ---Economics-1982-0-08.txt---
analysis. Though this area encompasses one
of its most crucial accomplishments, there is
no way I can do justice to the details of the
analysis in an oral presentation and within
my allotted span of time. However, an intuitive
view of the matter is not difficult.
The key to the analysis lies in the second
welfare property of contestable equilibriatheir
incompatibility with inefficiency of any
sort. In particular, they are incompatible with
inefficiency in the organization of an industry.
That is, suppose we consider whether
a particular output quantity of an industry
will be produced by two firms or by a thousand.
Suppose it turns out that the two-firm
arrangement can produce the given output at
a cost 20 percent lower than it can be done
by the 1,000 firms. Then one implication of
our analysis is that the industry cannot be in
long-run equilibrium if it encompasses 1,000
producers. Thus we already have some hint
about the equilibrium industry structure of a
contestable market.

We can go further with this example. Suppose
that, with the given output vector for
the industry, it turns out that no number of
firms other than two can produce at as low a
total cost as is possible under a two-firm
arrangement. That is, suppose two firms can
produce the output vector at a total cost
lower than it can be done by one firm or
three firms or sixty or six thousand. Then we
say that for the given output vector the industry
is a natural duopoly.

This now tells us how the industry's structure
can be determined. We proceed, conceptually,
in two steps. First we determine what
structure happens to be most efficient for the
production of a given output vector by a
given industry. Next, we investigate when
market pressures will lead the industry toward
such an efficient structure in equilibrium.


Now, the first step, though it has many
intriguing analytic attributes, is essentially a
pure matter of computation. Given the cost
function for a typical firm, it is ultimately a
matter of calculation to determine how many
firms will produce a given output most efficiently.
For example, if economies of scale
hold throughout the relevant range and there
are sufficient complementarities in the production
of the different commodities supplied
by the firm, then it is an old and
well-known conclusion that single firm production
will be most economical-that we
are dealing with a natural monopoly.
Similarly, in the single product case suppose
the average cost curve is U shaped and
attains its minimum point at an output of
10,000 units per year. Then it is obvious that
if the industry happens to sell 50,000 units
per year, this output can be produced most
cheaply if it is composed of exactly five
firms, each producing 10,000 units at its
point of minimum average cost.
Things become far more complex and more
interesting when the firm and the industry
produce a multiplicity of commodities, as
they always do in reality. But the logic is
always the same. When the industry output
vector is small compared to the output vectors
the firm can produce at relatively low
cost, then the efficient industry structure will
be characterized by very few firms. The opposite
will be true when the industry's output
vector is relatively far from the origin. In the
multiproduct case, since average cost cannot
be defined, two complications beset the characterization
of the output vectors which the
firm can produce relatively efficiently. First,
since here average cost cannot be defined, we
cannot simply look for the point of minimum
average costs. But we overcome this
problem by dealing with output bundles having
fixed proportions among commodity
quantities-by moving along a ray in output
space. Along any such ray the behavior of
average cost is definable, and the point of
minimum ray average cost (RA C) is our
criterion of relatively efficient scale for the
firm. Thus, in Figure 1 we have a ray average
cost curve for the production of boots and
shoes when they are produced in the proportion
given by ray OR. We see that for such
bundles ytm is the point of minimum RA C. A
second problem affecting the determination
of the output vectors the firm can produce
efficiently is the choice of output proportions
-the location of the ray along which the
firm will operate. This depends on the degree
of complementarity in production of the
goods, and it also lends itself to formal analysis.


We note also that the most efficient number
of firms will vary with the location of the

industry's output vector. The industry may
be a natural monopoly with one output vector,
a natural duopoly with another, and
efficiency may require seventy-three firms
when some third output vector is provided
by the industry.

This, then, completes the first of the two
basic steps in the endogenous determination
of industry structure. Here we have examined
what industry structure is least costly
for each given output vector of a given industry,
and have found how the result depends
on the magnitudes of the elements of
that output vector and the shape of the cost
function of the typical firm. So far the discussion
may perhaps be considered normative
rather than behavioral. It tells us what
structure is most efficient under the circumstances,
not which industry structure will
emerge under the pressures of the market
mechanism.

The transition toward the second, behavioral,
stage of the analysis is provided by the
observation that the optimal structure of an
industry depends on its output vector, while
that output vector in turn depends on the
prices charged by its firms. But, since pricing
depends on industry structure, we are
brought full circle to the conclusion that
pricing behavior and industry structure must,
ultimately, be determined simultaneously and
endogenously.

We are in no position to go much further
than this for a market whose properties are
unspecified. But, for a perfectly contestable
market, we can go much further. Indeed, the
properties of perfect contestability cut
through every difficulty and tell us the equilibrium
prices, outputs, and industry structure,
all at once.

Where more than one firm supplies a
product, we have already characterized these
prices precisely. For we have concluded that
each equilibrium price will equal the associated
marginal cost. Then, given the industry's
cost and demand relationships, this yields
the industry's output quantities simultaneously
with its prices, in the usual manner.
Here there is absolutely nothing new in the
analysis.

But what is new is the format of the
analysis of the determination of industry
structure. As I have already pointed out,
structure is determined by the efficiency requirement
of equilibrium in any contestable
market. Since no such equilibrium is compatible
with failure to minimize industry costs,
it follows that the market forces under perfect
contestability will bring us results consistent
with those of our normative analysis.
Whatever industry structures minimize total
costs for the equilibrium output vector must
turn out to be the only structures consistent
with industry equilibrium in the long run.
Thus, for contestable markets, but for contestable
markets only, the second stage of the
analysis of industry structure turns out to be
a sham. Whatever industry structure was
shown by the first, normative, portion of the
analysis to be least costly must also emerge
as the industry structure selected by market
behavior. No additional calculations are required
by the behavioral analysis. It will all
have been done in the normative costminimization
analysis and the behavioral

analysis is pure bonus.

Thus, as I promised, I have indicated how
contestability theory departs from the older
theory which implicitly took industry structure
to be determined exogenously in a
manner totally unspecified and, instead,
along with other recent writings, embraces
the determination of industry structure as an
integral part of the theory to be dealt with
simultaneously with the determination of
prices and outputs.

At this point I can only conjecture about
the determination of industry structure once
we leave the limiting case of perfect contestability.
But my guess is that there are no


### ---Economics-1982-0-10.txt---
sharp discontinuities here, and that while the
industry structures which emerge in reality
are not always those which minimize costs,
they will constitute reasonable approximations
to the efficient structures. If this is not
so it is difficult to account for the similarities
in the patterns of industry structure that one
observes in different countries. Why else do
we not see agriculture organized as an
oligopoly in any free market economy, or
automobiles produced by 10,000 firms?
Market pressures must surely make any very
inefficient market structure vulnerable to entry,
to displacement of incumbents by foreign
competition, or to undermining in other
ways. If that is so, the market structure that
is called for by contestability theory may not
prove to be too bad an approximation to
what we encounter in reality.

II. On Oligopoly Equilibrium

I should like now to examine oligopoly
equilibrium somewhat more extensively. We
have seen that, except where a multiproduct
oligopoly firm happens to sell some of its
products in markets in which it has no competitors,
an important partial monopoly case
which I will ignore in what follows, all prices
must equal the corresponding marginal costs
in long-run equilibrium. But in an oligopoly
market, this is a troublesome concept. Unless
the industry output vector happens to fall at
a point where the cost function is characterized
by locally constant returns to scale,
we know that zero profits are incompatible
with marginal cost pricing. Particularly if
there are scale economies at that point, so
that marginal cost pricing precludes financial
viability, we can hardly expect such a solution
to constitute an equilibrium. Besides, we
have seen that long-run equilibrium requires
profit to be precisely zero. We would thus
appear to have run into a major snag by
concluding that perfect contestability always
leads to marginal cost pricing under oligopoly.


This is particularly so if the (ray) average
curve is U shaped, with its minimum occurring
at a single point, y n. For in this case
that minimum point is the only output of the
firm consistent with constant returns to scale
and with zero profits under marginal cost
pricing. Thus, dealing with the single product
case to make the point, it would appear, say,
that if the A C-minimizing output is 1,000, in
a contestable market, equilibrium is possible
if quantity demanded from the industry happens
to be exactly 2,000 units (so two firms
can produce 1,000 units each) or exactly
3,000 units or exactly 4,000 units, etc. But
suppose the demand curve happens to intersect
the industry AC curve, say, at 4,030
units. That is, then, the only industry output
satisfying the equilibrium requirement that
price equals zero profit. But then, at least
one of the four or five firms in the industry
must produce either more or less than 1,000
units of output, and so the slope of its AC
curve will not be zero at that point, precluding
either MC pricing or zero profits and,
consequently, violating one or the other of
the requirements of equilibrium in a perfectly
contestable market.

It would appear that equilibrium will be
impossible in this perfectly contestable
market unless by a great piece of luck the
industry demand curve happens to intersect
its AC curve at 2,000 or 3,000 units or some
other integer multiple of 1,000 units of output.


There are a variety of ways in which one
can grapple with this difficulty. In his dissertation
at New York University, Thijs ten
Raa has explored the issue with some care
and has shown that the presence of entry
costs of sufficient magnitude, that is, irreversible
costs which must be borne by an
entrant but not by an incumbent, can
eliminate the existence problem. The minimum
size of the entry cost required to permit
an equilibrium will depend on the size of the
deviation from zero profits under marginal
cost pricing and ten Raa has given us rules
for its determination. He has shown also that
the existence problem, as measured by the
required minimum size of entry cost,
decreases rapidly as the equilibrium number
of firms of the industry increases, typically
attaining negligible proportions as that number
reaches, say, ten enterprises. For, as is
well known, when the firm's average cost
curve is U shaped the industry's average cost
curve will approach a horizontal line as the

size of industry output increases. This is
shown in Figure 2 which is a standard diagram
giving the firm's and the industry's AC
curves when the former is U shaped. As a
result, the deviations between average cost
and marginal cost will decline as industry
output increases and so the minimum size of
the entry cost required to preserve equilibrium
declines correspondingly.

However, here I want to describe another
approach offered in our book to the problem
of existence which I have just described- the
difficulty of satisfying simultaneously the
zero-profit requirement and the requirement
of marginal cost pricing. This second avenue
relies on the apparently unanimous conclusion
of empirical investigators of the cost
function of the firm, that AC curves are not,
in fact, characterized by a unique minimum
point as they would be if they had a smooth
U shape. Rather, these investigators tell us,
the A C curve of reality has a flat bottom -an
interval along which it is horizontal. That is,
average costs do tend to fall at first with size
of output, then they reach a minimum and
continue at that level for some range of
outputs, after which they may begin to rise
once more. An A C curve of this variety is
shown in Figure 3. Obviously, such a flat
segment of the A C curves does help matters
because there is now a range of outputs over
which MC pricing yields zero profits. Moreover,
the longer the flat-bottomed segment
the better matters are for existence of equilibrium.
Indeed, it is easy to show that if the
left-hand end of the flat segment occurs at
output y' and the right-hand end occurs at
kym, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 the
existence problem disappears altogether, because
the industry's AC curves will be horizontal
for any output greater than Ym, That

FIGURE 3

is, in any contestable market in which two or
more firms operate the industry AC curve
will be horizontal and MC pricing will always
yield zero profits. To confirm that this
is so, note that if, for example, the flat
segment for the firm extends from y = 1,000
to y 2,000, then any industry output of,
say, 9,000 + Ay where 0< A y < 9,000 can be
produced by nine firms, each of them turning
out more than 1,000 but less than 2,000
units. Hence, each of them will operate along
the horizontal portion of its AC curve, as
equilibrium requires.

Thus, if the horizontal interval (yi, kym)
happens to satisfy k , 2, there is no longer
any problem for existence of equilibrium in a
contestable market with two or more firms.
But fate may not always be so kind. What if
that horizontal interval is quite short, that is,
k is quite close to unity? Such a case is
shown in our diagram where for illustration I
have taken k =4/3.

I should like to take advantage of your
patience by dealing here not with the simplest
case-that of the single product industry-
but with the multiproduct problem.
I do this partly to offer you some feeling of
the way in which the multiproduct analysis,
which is one of the hallmarks of our study,
works out in practice.

Because, as we have seen, there is no way
one can measure average cost for all output
combinations in the multiproduct case, I will
deal exclusively with the total cost function.
Figure 4 shows such a total cost function for
the single firm, which is taken to manufacture
two products, boots and shoes.
Let us pause briefly to examine its shape.
Along any ray such as OR, which keeps


### ---Economics-1982-0-12.txt---
output proportions constant, we have an
ordinary total cost curve, OST. With one
exception, which I will note soon, I have
drawn it to have the usual sort of shape, with
marginal costs falling near the origin and
rising at points much further from the origin.
On the other hand, the trans ray cut above
AB yields a cross section C'TC which is more
or less U shaped. This means that it is relatively
cheaper to produce boots and shoes
together (point U) than to produce them in
isolation (point A or point B). That is, this
convex trans ray shape is enough to offer us
the complementarity which leads firms and
industries to turn out a multiplicity of products
rather than specializing in the production
of a single good.

Now what, in such a case, corresponds to
the flat bottom of an AC curve in a single
product case? The answer is that the cost
function in the neighborhood of the corresponding
output must be linearly homogeneous.
In Figure 5 such a region, a/3yS, is
depicted. It is linearly homogeneous because
it is generated by a set of rays such as L, M,
and N. For simplicity in the discussion that
follows, I have given this region a very regular
shape-it is, approximately, a rectangle
which has been moved into three-dimensional
space and given a U-shaped cross section.
Now Figure 6 combines the two preceding
diagrams and we see that they have been
drawn to mesh together, so that the linearly
homogeneous region constitutes a portion of
the firm's total cost surface. We see then that
the firm's total cost does have a region in
which constant returns to scale occur, and
which corresponds to the flat-bottomed segment
of the A C curve.



Moreover, as before, I have deliberately
kept this segment quite narrow. Indeed, I
have repeated the previous proportions, letting
the segment extend from a distance ym
from the origin to the distance I 4ym along
any ray on the floor of the diagram.
Let us now see what happens in these
circumstances when we turn to the total cost
surface for the industry. This is depicted in
Figure 7 which shows a relationship that
may at first seem surprising. In Figure 7 I
depict only the linearly homogeneous portions
of the industry's cost surface. There we
see that while for the firm linear homogeneity
prevailed only in the interval from y' to
13 Imy in the case of industry output linear
homogeneity also holds in that same interval
but, in addition, it holds for the interval 2ym
to 22 , and in the region extending from
3ym to infinity. That is, everywhere beyonc
3y' the industry's total cost function is linearly
homogeneous. In this case, then, we
have three regions of local linear homogeneINDUSTRY

which is identical with that of the individual
firm, the larger region abcd, and the infinite
region aleph beth....

Before showing why this is so we must
pause to note the implications of the exercise.
For it means that even a relatively
small region of flatness in the A C curve of
the individual firm, that is, of linear homogeneity
in its total cost function, eliminates
the bulk of the existence problem for oligopoly
equilibrium in a contestable market. The
problem does not arise for outputs nearer to
the origin than Ym because such outputs are
supplied most efficiently by a monopoly
which is not required to price at marginal
cost in a contestable market equilibrium. The
problem also does not arise for any industry
output greater than 3ym in this case, because
everywhere beyond that marginal cost pricing
yields zero profits. There are two relatively
narrow regions in which no equilibrium
is, indeed, possible, but here we may
conjecture that the vicissitudes of disequilibrium
will cause shifts in the demand relationships
as changing prices and changing
consumption patterns affect tastes, and so
the industry will ultimately happen upon an
equilibrium position and remain there until
exogenous disturbances move it away. Thus
we end up with an oligopoly equilibrium
whose prices, profits, and other attributes are
determined without benefit of the conjectural
variation, reaction functions, and the
other paraphernalia of standard oligopoly
analysis.

To complete this discussion of oligopoly
equilibrium in a contestable market, it only
remains for me to explain why the regions of
linear homogeneity in the industry's cost
function are as depicted in Figure 7. The
answer is straightforward. Let C(y) be the
firm's total cost function for which we have
assumed for expository simplicity that in the
interval from ym to I lym along each and
every ray, total cost grows exactly proportionately
with output. Then two firms can
produce 2ym at the same unit cost, and three
firms can produce 3ym at that same unit cost
for the given output bundle, etc. But by
exactly the same argument, the two firms
together, each producing no more than 1 ' '


### ---Economics-1982-0-14.txt---
can turn out anything up to 2'ym without
affecting unit costs, and three firms can produce
as much as 3 ym, that is, as much as
4ym. In sum, the intervals of linear homogeneity
for the industry are the following:
Interval 1: from ym to I ym

Interval 2: from 2ym to 22ym

Interval 3: from 3ym to 4ym

Interval 4: from 4ym to 54ym

Interval 5: from Sytm to 62y'

That is, each interval begins at an integer
multiple of ym and extends 1/3 ym further
than its predecessor. Thus, beyond 3ym
successive intervals begin to touch or overlap
and that is why linear homogeneity extends
everywhere beyond 3ym as I claimed.3
There is one complication in the multiproduct
case which I have deliberately slid
over, feeling the discussion was already complicated
enough. The preceding argument assumes
implicitly that the firms producing the
industry output all employ the same output
proportions as those in the industry output
vector. For otherwise, it is not legitimate to
move outward along a single ray as the number
of firms is increased. But suppose increased
industry output were to permit savings
through increased specialization. Might
there not be constant returns with fixed output
proportions and yet economies of scale
for the industry overall? This problem is
avoided by our complementarity assumption
used to account for the industry's multiproduct
operation-our U-shaped trans-ray cross
section. This, in effect, rules out such savings
from specialization in the regions where linear
homogeneity also rules out savings from
increased scale.

This, then, completes my discussion of
oligopoly equilibrium in perfectly contestable
markets, which we have seen, yields a
determinate set of prices and outputs that is
not dependent upon assumptions about the
nature of incumbent firm's expectations relating
to entrants' behavior and offers us a
concrete and favorable conclusion on the
welfare implications of contestable oligopoly.
III. Intertemporal Vulnerability to
Inefficient Entry

Having so far directed attention to areas
in which the invisible hand manifests unexpected
strength, I should like to end my
story by dealing with an issue in relation to
which it is weaker than some of us might
have expected. As I indicated before, this is
the issue of intertemporal production involving
durable capital goods.

The analysis is far more general than the
following story suggests, but even the case I
describe is sufficiently general to make the
point. We deal with an industry in which a
product is offered by a single firm that provides
it period after period. The equilibrium
quantity of the commodity that is demanded
grows steadily with the passage of time in a
manner that is foreseen without uncertainty.
Because of economies of scale in the production
of capacity the firm deliberately builds
some excess capacity to take care of anticipated
growth in sales volume. But there is
some point, let us say, z =45 years in the
future, such that it would be uneconomic to
take further growth in sales volume into
account in the initial choice of capacity. This
is so because the opportunity (interest) cost
of the capacity that remains idle for 45 or
more years exceeds the savings made possible
by the economies of scale of construction.
Thus, after 45 years it will pay the firm
to undertake a second construction project
to build the added capacity needed to produce
the goods demanded of it.

Suppose that in every particular period
our producer is a natural monopolist, that is,
he produces the industry's supply of its one
commodity at a cost lower than it can be
done by any two or more enterprises. Then
considering that same product in different
periods to be formally equivalent to different
goods we may take our supplier to be an
intertemporal natural monopolist in a multiproduct
industry. That is, no combination of


### ---Economics-1982-0-15.txt---
two or more firms can produce the industry's
intertemporal output vector as cheaply as he.
I will prove now under a set of remarkably
unrestrictive assumptions that despite its cost
advantages, there exists no intertemporal
price vector consistent with equilibrium for
this firm. That is, whatever his price vector,
his market will at some time be vulnerable to
partial or complete takeover by an entrant
who has neither superior skills nor technological
superiority and whose entrance
increases the quantities of resources used up
in production. In other words, here the
invisible hand proves incapable of protecting
the most efficient producing arrangement and
leaves the incumbent producer vulnerable to
displacement by an aggressive entrant. I leave
to your imaginations what, if anything, this
says about the successive displacements
on the world market of the Dutch by the
English, the English by the Germans and the
Americans, and the Americans, perhaps, by
the Japanese.

The proof of our proposition on the intertemporal
vulnerability of incumbents to entry
that is premature from the viewpoint of
cost minimization does require just a little
bit of algebra. To keep our analysis simple, I
will divide time into two periods, each lasting
z =45 years so that capacity in the first
period is, optimally, just sufficient to satisfy
all demand, but in the second, it requires the
construction of added capacity to meet demand
growth because, by assumption, anticipatory
construction to meet growth more
than z years in the future simply is too
costly. Also for simplicity, I will assume that
there are no costs other than cost of construction.
Of course, neither this nor the use
of only two periods really affects the argument
in any way. My only three substantive
assumptions are that demand is growing with
time, that there are economies of scale, that
is, declining average costs in construction,
and that there exists some length of time, z,
so great that it does not pay in the initial
construction to build capacity sufficient for
the growth in quantity demanded that will
occur beyond that date.

The argument, like the notation, is now
straightforward. Let y, be output in period t,
P, be price in period t, and K(y) be the cost
of construction of capacity sufficient to produce
(a maximum of) y units per period.
Here, both p, and K(y) are expressed in
discounted present value.4

Then, by assumption, our firm will construct
at the beginning of the first period
capacity just sufficient to produce output y,
at cost K(y,) and at the beginning of the
second period it will produce the rest of the
capacity it needs, Y2- yI >0, at the cost
K(y2 - y ).

The first requirement for the prices in
question to be consistent with equilibrium is
that they permit the incumbent to cover his
costs, that is, that

(1) PIYI+P2Y2 2 K(y1)+K(y2-y1).
Second, for these prices to constitute an
equilibrium they must protect the incumbent
against any and all possible incursions by
entrants. That is, suppose an entrant were to
consider the possibility of constructing
capacity y, and not expanding in the future,
and, by undercutting the incumbent, selling
the same output, y,, in each period. Entry on
these terms will in fact be profitable unless
the prices are such that the sale of y, in each
period does not bring in revenues sufficient
to cover the cost, K(y,), of the entrant's
once-and-for-all construction. That is, entry
will be profitable unless

(2) plyl + P2Y1 - K(y1).

Thus, the prices in question cannot constitute
an equilibrium unless (2) as well as (1)
are satisfied.

Now, subtracting (2) from (1) we obtain
immediately

P2(Y2-y) K(y2- yi)

or

(3) p2 > K(Y2-Y1Y)/(AY2-Yj),

4That is, if pI, p*, represent the undiscounted prices,
PI = P, P2= p*/(l + r), where r is the rate of interest,
etc.


### ---Economics-1982-0-16.txt---
but, by the assumption that average construction
cost is declining, since Yi >0,
(4) K(y2-y1)/(y2-y1)> K(y2)/y2.
Substituting this into (3) we have at once
P2> K(Y2)/Y2

or

(5) P2Y2 > K(y2).

Inequality (5) is our result. For it proves
that any prices which satisfy equilibrium
requirements (1) and (2) must permit a second-
period entrant using the same techniques
to build capacity Y2 from the ground
up, at cost K(y2), to price slightly below
anything the incumbent can charge and yet
recover his costs; and that in doing so, the
entrant can earn a profit.

Thus, our intertemporal natural monopolist
cannot quote, at time zero, any prices
capable of preventing the takeover of some
or all of his market. Moreover, this is so
despite the waste, in the form of replication
of the incumbent's plant, that this entails.
That, then, is the end of the formal argument,
the proof that here the invisible hand
manifests weakness that is, perhaps, unexpected.


You will all undoubtedly recognize that
the story as told here in its barest outlines
omits all sorts of nuances, such as entrants'
fear of responsive pricing, the role of bankruptcy,
depreciation of capital, and the like.
This is not the place to go into these matters
for it is neither possible nor appropriate here
for me to go beyond illustration of the logic
of the new analysis.

IV. Concluding Comments

Before closing let me add a word on policy
implications, whose details must also be left
to another place. In spirit, the policy conclusions
are consistent with many of those
economists have long been espousing. At
least in the intratemporal analysis, the heroes
are the (unidentified) potential entrants who
exercise discipline over the incumbent, and
who do so most effectively when entry is
free. In the limit, when entry and exit are
completely free, efficient incumbent monopolists
and oligopolists may in fact be able to
prevent entry. But they can do so only by
behaving virtuously, that is, by offering to
consumers the benefits which competition
would otherwise bring. For every deviation
from good behavior instantly makes them
vulnerable to hit-and-run entry.
This immediately offers what may be a
new insight on antitrust policy. It tells us
that a history of absence of entry in an
industry and a high concentration index may
be signs of virtue, not of vice. This will be
true when entry costs in our sense are negligible.
And, then, efforts to change market
structure must be regarded as mischievous
and antisocial in their effects.
A second and more obvious conclusion is
the questionable desirability of artificial
impediments to entry, such as regulators were
long inclined to impose. The new analysis
merely reinforces the view that any proposed
regulatory barrier to entry must start off
with a heavy presumption against its adoption.
Perhaps a bit newer is the emphasis on
the importance of freedom of exit which is as
crucial a requirement of contestability as is
freedom of entry. Thus we must reject as
perverse the propensity of regulators to resist
the closing down of unprofitable lines of
activity. This has even gone so far as a
Congressional proposal (apparently supported
by Ralph Nader) to require any plant
with yearly sales exceeding $250,000 to provide
fifty-two weeks of severance pay and to
pay three years of taxes, before it will be
permitted to close, and that only after giving
two years notice!

There is much more to the policy implications
of the new theory, but I will stop here,
also leaving its results relating to empirical
research for discussion elsewhere.
Let me only say in closing that I hope I
have adequately justified my characterization
of the new theory as a rebellion or an uprising.
I believe it offers a host of new analytical
methods, new tasks for empirical
research, and new results. It permits reexamination
of the domain of the invisible
hand, yields contributions to the theory of


### ---Economics-1982-0-17.txt---
oligopoly, provides a standard for policy that
is far broader and more widely applicable
than that of perfect competition, and leads
to a theory that analyzes the determination
of industry structure endogenously and
simultaneously with the analysis of the other
variables more traditionally treated in the
theory of the firm and the industry. It aspires
to provide no less than a unifying theory as a
foundation for the analysis of industrial
organization. I will perhaps be excused for
feeling that this was an ambitious undertaking.
 ## Economics-1983-0


### ---Economics-1983-0-03.txt---
When I began to study economics, in the
1930's, macroeconomics certainly existed, in
the works of such luminaries as Wicksell,
Fisher, Robertson, and the early Keynes. But
it was surely not recognized as a branch of
economics in which one might specialize; nor
was it regarded as necessary for the education
of an economist. Thus, like almost everyone
else, I began professional life as a
price-theorist. The principal alternative was
to become an institutionalist; and that didn't
particularly attract me. Only later, and somewhat
by accident, did I become a macroeconomist.


Ever since the emergence of macroeconomics
as a distinct and (almost) respectable
branch of analysis, there has been a conscious
tension between macroeconomics and
microeconomics; much of this tension relates
to the roles and the behavior of prices and of
the price level. Surely, it cannot be said that
macroeconomics ignores prices and price
changes, as is sometimes suggested. Milton
Friedman and his monetarist associates and
followers-who are macroeconomists of the
first water-surely do not ignore prices. And
the patron saint of my kind of macroeconomics,
John Maynard Keynes, also certainly
paid a great deal of attention to both relative
prices and the price level. My concern with
prices here, however, is not with inflation,
but rather with the price-theoretical foundations
of macroeconomics. Essentially, I will
be discussing some of the roles that microeconomists
and macroeconomists see for

prices, and particularly for price changes.
Price theory has moved a long way since I
deserted it, and I no longer claim any expertise
in this area. But I have the impression
that many current problems both in microand
macroeconomics tend to be the same
problems-looked at from opposite sides of
the borderline between them. Thus I propose
to lead us on a stroll along some sectors of
that border, moving back and forth across it
from time to time, for there is no fence. And
I intend only a meander, not a mapping. The
spirit in which the journey is undertaken is
that this is really all one country, and strollers
should be welcome.

But it is not an imaginary country that I
propose we visit. We will see no Walrasian
auctioneers, although we will see many
markets that seem to work pretty well without
them. On the other hand, we will see very
few wage rates being frequently revised; and
many prices will look as though they were
being revised only to maintain fairly stable
markups over unit costs. In general, we will
observe that the population of this country is
neither very much brighter-nor much more
stupid-than you and I are, in our own
economic decisions.

Some aspects of the problems that I will
discuss are particularly important in an age
of inflation, and to the theory of inflation.
But I prefer to conduct most of my discussion
without explicit reference to changes in
the general price level. For almost all of the
matters that I will discuss primarily involve
relative prices; and it is simpler to deal with
them on the assumption of a constant price
level. That way, I do not need to keep repeating
"real price."

I start with the prices and inventories of
standardized commodities.

I. Commodity Prices and Inventories
Economists often find it useful to think of
the quantities of a commodity supplied to a
competitive market as consisting of a supply
from current production plus a possible
supply from inventory; and the market demand,


### ---Economics-1983-0-04.txt---
similarly, as consisting of a demand
for current use or consumption plus a possible
demand for additions to inventory. Any
market-participant's demand for additions to
inventory clearly should be based upon an
expectation that the price will increase sufficiently
over some future period, at least to
cover costs of storage plus interest for that
period. Any market-participant's willingness
to supply goods from inventory should be
based on an expectation that the price will
rise insufficiently over any future period to
cover costs of storage and interest for that
period. Since expectations of future prices
are never certain, the expected prices described
should include discounts to reflect
risk aversion, or premiums to reflect the
pleasures of risk assumption.

Given the conditions that permit or require
the holding of inventories, inventories
may have either a stabilizing or a destabilizing
effect on the commodity's price, production,
and consumption. Traditionally,
however, economists have assumed that the
effect of inventories is to stabilize each of
these. We think of the wheat market, for
instance, where an entire year's new supply
(at least in either Hemisphere) becomes
available in a relatively short period of time.
Were the holding of inventories of wheat (or
wheat products) impossible, the market price
would have to fall low enough during the
harvest period to assure immediate consumption
of the entire crop. The price would then
rise high enough during the remainder of the
year to cut off all consumption-or else high
enough to make profitable the production
of wheat in greenhouses, and to reduce its
off-season consumption to the quantity so
produced. However, given the possibility of
storage of wheat or wheat products-by producers,
dealers, or intermediate or final consumers-
the price would normally fall only
enough during the harvest period to induce
the appropriate amount of inventory accumulation.
The price would then rise, during
the remainder of the year, as inventories
were drawn down, sufficiently to cover at all
times the costs of storage, interest, and the
assumption of risk from holding inventories.
Such seasonal price and inventory movements
often are approximately observable.
The recognition that not only seasonal but
also year-to-year variations may occur in the
harvest as a result of weather conditions or
civil disturbance, and that year-to-year variations
may also occur in the demand for
wheat, reflecting, say, the "business cycle,"
will induce some or many market participants
to carry over inventories of wheat
(or of its products) from one crop year to the
next (or to reduce stocks previously carried
over). Stocks held will increase or decrease as
the current market price varies relative to
what is believed to be the current "normal"
or "long-run equilibrium" price: the price
that would exactly balance normal annual
new supply and normal annual consumption.
Through this process, not only seasonal
fluctuations but also year-to-year fluctuations
of market price and of consumption are
reduced, even in the presence of substantial
year-to-year changes in production or in final
demand. Through changes in inventories,
supply or demand in any particular year, in
effect, may thus borrow from past and/or
from future years' supply or demand.
As, and to the extent, that market participants
learn of new "events" affecting or
likely to affect either future normal production
or future normal demand, the rate of
inventory accumulation or decumulation will
be varied so as to produce a new time path
of price and current consumption, associated
with an expected new equilibrium of prices
and quantities. Needless to add, this behavior
is stabilizing with respect both to prices
and quantities: at least as compared to what
would have happened if inventories could
not exist, or if storage costs-or the interest
rate-were higher. And this activity clearly
increases economic welfare.

These activities of course reflect the behavior
now described as based upon "rational
expectations." Market participants have in
their heads a "model" of how supply and
demand affect market price over time; on
the basis of that model, and of all available
information-including all new information-
about present and future production
and demand and the size of existing
inventories, agents buy for or sell from inventories
in ways that cause the market price
to move continuously toward its current normal,


### ---Economics-1983-0-05.txt---
long-term, market-clearing level, taking
account of storage costs and interest, and
appropriately discounted for uncertainty. Indeed,
it was precisely in the context of reasoning
about markets for storable individual
commodities (and agricultural commodities
in particular) that John Muth first presented
the concept that he called "rational expectations"
. ' In this particular microeconomic
context there can surely be no valid objection
to rational expectations. But we must
not forget that the primary way in which
expectations- rational or otherwise-affect
current prices is precisely through affecting
behavior with respect to inventories, along
with sales or purchases for future delivery
(i.e., negative inventories) or through affecting
some other form of intertemporal substitution
between, for example, labor and
leisure, now and in the future.2
Markets for commodities, of course, vary
widely in the extent to which inventories are
able to stabilize price or consumption. At the
one extreme is the traditional market for
fresh flowers. Holding inventories is, by definition,
impossible. Random fluctuations in
the production of or the demand for fresh
flowers are thus fully reflected in daily prices.
And because the immediate response of
amounts supplied to price changes is zero, by
definition, and the response of amounts demanded
to price is relatively small, price
fluctuations in fresh flowers may be substantial.
Inventories cannot supplement

below-normal current production; nor can
inventories be accumulated to profit from a
below-normal current price or from an
expected above-normal future price.
At the opposite extreme are the markets
for the durable products of agriculture and
mining-for example, for wheat or tin. Here
storage costs are relatively low, and inventories
may easily reach the equivalent of one or
even several years' production. Under such
circumstances, it is not implausible to argue
that rational expectations and inventory
adjustments tend to stabilize prices and consumption
in the presence of random fluctuations
in supply or demand.3 On the other
hand, durable or " permanent" changes in
supply or demand alter the equilibrium price,
and, almost at once, the actual market price
begins to reflect that change.
II. Price Speculation

However, the existence of large inventories
also introduces the possibility of price instability
arising from "speculation." Consider,
for example, the extreme case of gold, when
it is only a commodity, and not used as
money. Gold is obviously very durable. And
its consumption and its production in any
year, or even in any decade, are both very
small relative to the size of the total existing
stock. The costs of storage are relatively low.
It is also nearly indestructible: its services as
ornament or store of value are consumed
with little or no disappearance or dissipation.
Most of the gold that was ever mined presumably
still exists, and is potentially available
as an addition to the market supply
from new production-at prices deemed sufficiently
above equilibrium. Gold is currently
produced; and its rate of production does
' Muth's 1961 article is, of course, now a classic.
However, an excellent much-earlier statement of the
way in which information and expectations affect the
wheat price appears (of course!) in Alfred Marshall. The
accompanying marginal note reads "Nearly all dealings
in commodities that are not very perishable, are affected
by calculation of the future" (pp. 337-38). Marshall
perhaps failed to close his argument by stating explicitly
that expected prices enter into today's production decisions,
although that is clearly implied.
21t was in precisely the context of inventories-and
by explicit analogy with the wheat market-that I once
explained Keynes' theory of the "speculative demand"
for money (or bonds). In my Macroeconomic Theory (pp.
175-76), I argued that, in the bond market-as in the
wheat market-speculation on future bond prices, in
the presence of large outstanding stocks of bonds and of
money, by agents who form expectations of "normal"
market-clearing prices, tends to stabilize bond prices at
or close to their normal level-thereby preventing interest
rate fluctuations from stabilizing aggregate demand
for goods and services in the short run against exogenous
variations in saving or investment propensities.
Although the term rational expectations had not yet
been invented, I was arguing that rational expectations
explained an interest-elastic (or bond-price-elastic) demand
for money.

31t is therefore somewhat anomalous that, although
Muth thus demolished the previous theory of the "cornhog
cycle," it is my impression that traces of such
price-quantity behavior still persist.


### ---Economics-1983-0-06.txt---
respond to its relative price (and to the expected
price that so strongly influences its
current price). But a year's production, even
at an historically enormous real price, adds
very little to the current market supply, compared
to that which is available from inventories.
Changes in the market price may affect,
at least modestly, the quantities of gold
demanded: by dentists, by manufacturers of
jewelry and objets d'art, or in industry (as a
conductor or chemical). But such changes in
quantities demanded are likewise small relative
to the size of the stock; and even the
manufacture of gold objects does not really
remove them from the inventory of gold.
Indeed, unmined gold (and the shares of
gold mining companies) are in effect part of
the inventory, too.

Although the price of gold has some effect
on its rates of discovery and production, as
well as on its consumption (in the sense of
its complete and permanent removal from
potential market supply), these responses of
quantities produced and consumed are truly
minimal in comparison with the size of outstanding
inventories. Thus, the market price
of gold depends mainly on peoples' (or, in
the past, on governments') willingness at that
price to hold the immense existing inventory
of gold. And this means that the current
price of gold depends mainly on expectations
of its future price. As noted earlier, the current
price of a standardized commodity can
diverge from any expected future price only
by the relatively small costs of storage plus
interest (and the cost of assuming the risk of
an incorrect expectation). But, in the case of
gold, a changed expectation of future price is
not soon erased by a changed rate of gold
production, nor by an altered level of any
consumption that subtracts permanently
from the stock. There may always be some
normal, long-run equilibrium price of gold
that would exactly equate current production
and current consumption (in the sense of
permanent disappearance). But that normal
price does not discipline the actual market
price of gold in the way that the normal,
long-run equilibrium price of wheat disciplines
its current market price. Rather-in
the absence of a fixed monetary price of
gold-its current price depends overwhelmingly
on the current expectation of what its
future price will be. And that future price
will depend on the expectation then of its
subsequent price.

Such a market is best characterized by
borrowing Keynes' parable (pp. 154-160) of
the beauty contest, which he used to explain
share prices. The price level of shares, he
suggested, depends on each market participant'
s calculation of what the other participants
are likely to expect it to be. It is
analogous to the contest to choose a beauty
queen, he said, in which the prizes go to
those who select the candidate for queen
thought most beautiful by the largest number
of other contestants. Instead of selecting
the candidate who is the most beautiful, each
contestant tries to calculate which candidate
is most likely to be chosen by other contestants.
But once each realizes that others
will be choosing on the same basis, he is
forced to speculate about what the average
opinion will be of what the average opinion
is. And that speculation can be carried to
progressively higher degrees, Keynes suggested.
Given no more solid a basis than this
for valuing shares, said Keynes, the price of
shares can be almost anything-and is likely
at times to be highly unstable.
Why does anyone buy gold at $52 an
ounce-or at $520 an ounce? Why does anyone
sell it at that price? Because the buyer
expects that the price tomorrow will exceed
$52 by more than the cost of carrying an
ounce of gold; and the seller expects that it
may be less than $52 plus carrying costs
tomorrow. Each such expectation in turn
reflects buyers' and sellers' judgments about
what buyers and sellers will be expecting
tomorrow for the day after tomorrow. The
only other rational reason for buying or selling
gold is the pure pleasure of risk assumption-
better known as gambling. And there
is surely much of that in the gold market.
Presumably, pure gambling has little net effect
on the price, although it does raise the
incomes or employment of brokers.4


### ---Economics-1983-0-07.txt---
Now, what precisely is the basic difference
between the wheat and the tin markets, on
the one hand, and the gold and the share
markets, on the other, that lets us assume in
the wheat or tin case that rational expectations
will normally stabilize prices and consumption
in the face either of random or of
predictable fluctuations in amounts supplied
or demanded, while in the gold case, there is
often destabilizing speculation?
The difference obviously has nothing to do
with price flexibility and continuous market
clearing; for these are trademarks not only of
the markets for wheat, tin, and pork bellies,
but also for gold (and for General Motors
shares). Rather, the difference is that in the
wheat and similar cases, the response of
quantities produced and/or quantities consumed
to price changes arising from shifts in
supply or demand can be large enough and
prompt enough to begin to move the price
toward its new equilibrium level within a
relevant time period; and that this response
therefore comes to be anticipated by market
participants. This prompt and substantial
stabilizing response of quantities produced
and consumed does not occur-and therefore
it is not expected to occur-in the case
of gold. As a consequence, in the presence of
large inventories, price expectations dominate
price-level determination not only in the short
term, but even in the moderately long term.
The prices so determined are unlikely to
contribute either to the stability of production
or consumption, or to the equality of
production and consumption. They may thus
produce movements in actual inventories, the
price effects of which, however, have only
modest and long-delayed effects in reversing
such movements.

Clearly, wheat and gold are more-or-less
extreme examples of a spectrum of durable
commodities, capable of storage. At the
wheat end of that spectrum, the responses of
amounts produced and consumed to price
changes are strong and prompt. Market participants
come to expect them to occur, and
take actions with respect to inventories that
tend to stabilize prices around their equilibrium
level, including any expected new
equilibrium level. At the gold end of the
spectrum, the responses of amounts produced
and consumed to price changes are
weak and slow, while inventories are very
large.5 Participants in such markets thus cannot
depend on price movements to be quickly
self-limiting. It is therefore not irrational for
some or many of them to speculate on the
direction of intermediate price movements.
Their speculation may often extend and exaggerate
price movements that had some

origin in changed supply or demand conditions.
Or it may extend and exaggerate price
movements caused by some random exogenous
disturbance, or even by the actions of
a few large traders (for example, the Hunts
in silver).

Most commodity markets lie between these
extremes. In such intermediate markets, price
movements may sometimes be-perhaps ordinarily
are-in the direction of a price that
tends fairly quickly to equate production and
consumption. At other times, price movements
may develop a cumulative momentum
in one direction, which can easily overshoot
the current long-run equilibrium price. Occasionally,
moreover, speculation can affect
even the most stable markets; and speculative
fevers can be transmitted from one
market to another.

The years 1971 through 1973 provide a
clear example of such speculation and of
such transmission.6 Coincidental crop failures
in wheat and coarse grains in several of the
main producing countries of the world-at a
time when world stocks were severely depleted-
caused grain prices to soar; this
helped to attract public attention to the then
popular "Club-of-Rome" fantasies of general
resource scarcity, which in turn helped
to transmit the speculative fever to still other
commodities. In a political environment in
which-partly for accidental reasons-macroeconomic
policies in a number of major

countries were unusually permissive, the
speculative rise in commodity prices soon
came to be reflected in wage rates and in-
'An extreme case, on the side of supply, is that of
nonproducible goods (for example, "old master" paintings
or old postage stamps) where all supply to the
market comes from inventory. An earlier version of this
paper included a considerable section on prices of such
" collectibles."

dustrial costs. Given the inertia of inflation,
once it becomes embodied in wage rates and
industrial costs; given the fortuitous response
of the oil-producing countries when
awakened by the international inflation; and
given the perhaps appropriate, but surely
delayed, responses to inflation by monetary
and fiscal policymakers in many of the industrial
countries, it is possible to understand
why the 1970's turned out to be such a
disappointing- even a disastrous- decade.
And commodity price speculation played
more than a small part in that disaster.
III. Rational "Price Bubbles"

The fact that rational expectations may
not preclude the existence for considerable
periods of speculative, self-maintaining price
movements toward zero or infinity has recently
been recognized in a rapidly expanding
theoretical literature of working papers
and a few published articles.7 Indeed, we are
seeing a "bubble" of papers on "rational
price bubbles." Whether rational expectations
are or are not consistent with price
bubbles, however, seems to depend entirely
on what definition one gives to the "rationality"
of rational expectations. One may define
as rational any expectation that, if generally
acted upon, will turn out to be essentially
self-confirming. In that case, price bubbles
generated by the simplest of extrapolative
price expectations may be consistent with
rational behavior. On the other hand, one
may alternatively define as rational only
those expectations that fully incorporate an
understanding of " long-run" "market fundamentals"
: namely, the assumption by each
agent of rationally maximizing behavior by
each other agent, each responding to observed
changes in prices and quantities as
would occur in a market model of "long-run
equilibrium," although observed through a
screen of random, nonserially correlated,
short-run disturbances. Actions based on
such expectations thus tend to confirm the
expectations; and each confirmation reinforces
further reliance up on the long-term
equilibrium model. There seems little room
for price bubbles in that version of rational
expectations.

But whether, and to what extent, market
fundamentals will, in fact, prevail, surely depends,
as I have argued above, on the durability
of the commodity, its storage costs,
and particularly on the degree to which, and
the speed with which, its production and
consumption are affected by expected price.
Given the world as it is, I suggest that the
"fundamentals" do not always and everywhere
prevail. Bubbles do occur, and are
important.

However, most or all of the new literature
on price bubbles appears to deal only with
price movements away from, or back towards,
the equilibrium price that reflects
long-run market fundamentals. It thus implies
that, when prices are, for any period,
approximately stable, they must therefore
be at or close to an equilibrium dictated
by market fundamentals-reflecting, at that
price, an approximate balance between the
expected supply from new production and
the expected demand for final consumption.
Price bubbles, in contrast, involve an extrapolation
of expected price movements (however
originating), causing further movement
in the same direction.

In my view, however, where the impacts of
price on amounts produced and consumed
are small, slow, and uncertain, a speculative
price-(i.e., a nonequilibrium price) is not
always or necessarily a moving price. The
price may rest for a considerable period of
time at-or fluctuate narrowly around-a
level far above (or below) any equilibrium
determined by market fundamentals. This
situation might represent either the extrapolation
of an originally accidental stability, or
a standoff between expectations of further
rise by some participants and the expectation
of fall by others.8


### ---Economics-1983-0-09.txt---
Under circumstances in which uncertainty
is overpowering, as Keynes suggested was
often the case for stock prices, a price may
remain approximately stable for a considerable
time on the basis of a tacit "convention,
" which market participants come to
accept. The convention amounts to the assumption
that

... the existing state of affairs will continue
indefinitely, except in so far as
we have specific reasons to expect a
change... For, if there exist organized
investment markets,... an investor can
legitimately encourage himself with the
idea that the only risk he runs is that of
a genuine change in the news over the
near future, as to the likelihood of which
he can attempt to form his own judgment,
and which is unlikely to be very
large. For, assuming that the convention
holds good, it is only these changes
which can affect the value of his investment,
and he need not lose his sleep
merely because he has not any notion
of what his investment will be worth
ten years hence.

[General Theory, pp. 152-53]

Thus, the price of gold might well, for a
considerable period of time, fluctuate narrowly
around a level far from the equilibrium
price at which amounts produced
and consumed would in the long run be
equal. And so, although to a considerably
lesser extent, could the price of wheat or tin.
Yet such a period of approximate stability
might at any time be upset by a major,
self-maintaining movement in either direction.


IV. Macroeconomic Inventory Theory
Let us now turn to some of the macroeconomic
implications of this microeconomic
theory of commodity prices and inventories.
First, and most important, is to recognize
that there is nothing in standard price theory-
even when we expand it to take account
of speculative demands for inventories, price
bubbles, or of the possible transmission of
speculative fever from one market to another-
that implies that the aggregate stock
of inventories, and the rate of aggregate
inventory accumulation for an entire economy
should exhibit any systematic variation
over time. Random disturbances to supply
and/or demand for particular commodities
or products might lead to periods of net
accumulation or net decumulation of inventories
of those products. But the aggregation
of many time-series, each subject to random,
non-serially-correlated variation, produces
only a time-series with proportionally smaller
variation. Thus, several years of systematic
general accumulation of inventories, followed
by substantial periods of general
decumulation of inventories, finds no basis
in conventional price theory.

Yet one of the most obvious macroeconomic
facts of life is the existence of pronounced
cycles, both in the size of aggregate
inventories and in their rate of accumulation.
Indeed, of all of the conventional subaggregates
of real national product, the one that
shows the greatest decrease (not merely in
percentage but in aggregate dollar amount)
between periods of business expansion and
of business contraction is, almost invariably,
that of the net addition to business inventories.
This total typically goes from a large
positive amount at business cycle peaks to
a large negative amount at business cycle
troughs. This difference exceeds the typical
cyclical decline in business investment in
plant and equipment, in residential construction,
in purchases by consumers or governments,
or in net exports. The existence of
these pronounced cycles in aggregate inventory
accumulation has long challenged macroeconomists
to develop theories that might
explain this phenomenon. The response to
this challenge has produced a second and
macroeconomic literature about inventories,
that is almost completely nonintersecting
with microeconomic price theory.
In this macroeconomic inventory literature,
prices and price expectations are rarea
world of constant change, few if any market participants
may share the same model of equilibrium-or
at least the same and "correct" model. In these situations,
most market participants may come to realize that
there is no price other than the current one that has any
better claim to being considered the equilibrium price.


### ---Economics-1983-0-10.txt---
ly mentioned. This second literature deals
primarily with work-in-process and manufactured
product inventories, including inventories
held by wholesalers and retailersalthough
it may also embrace commodity

inventories held by manufacturers or processors
(but not by producers and dealers). The
earliest versions of this literature described
inventories as being held, increased, or reduced
as the result of production or ordering
decisions that were based upon expectations
of future changes in quantities produced or
demanded-expectations generated mainly
by recently experienced levels of production
or sales. It purported to describe the determinants,
for example, of the desired and actual
stocks of coal and iron ore held by steel
mills; of the desired and actual inventories of
finished steel held by mills, steel warehouses,
or steel-using manufacturers; of the desired
and actual inventories of automobiles held
by producers and dealers; and of the desired
stocks and actual stocks of steel bedsprings
held by department stores. In early versions
of this macroeconomic literature, inventory
decisions were shown to be capable of having
highly destabilizing macroeconomic effects-
particularly when expectations of future
sales were modelled as responsive in
particular ways to experienced levels and
changes of sales, while production responded
to orders and expected sales.9
This literature, of course, belongs to a
universe of discourse in which prices (including
wage rates) do not clear markets continuously,
but rather adjust slowly to evidence of
gaps between amounts supplied and demanded.
Or they may be "administered" on
the basis of working rules of thumb based
mainly on costs or on other prices. In this
universe of discourse, such pricing rules are
not necessarily irrational, given the limited
extent of knowledge, and the experience of
past instability. And, since prices so established
do not typically cause production and
consumption to move quickly into approximate
equality, market participants do not
expect that prices will so move, and therefore
they do not so move. Rather, production and
sales are brought toward equality primarily
by changes-delayed changes-in planned
rates of production or purchase, that reflect
observed or expected changes in quantities
consumed or used in production, and that
are designed to restore or to maintain efficient
levels of inventories. Indeed, microeconomic
theories of rational quantity adjustments
to unplanned differences between
production and sales began to be developed
in the early 1950's, and have increasingly
supplied a formal basis for macroeconomic
inventory theory.'0 These fluctuations in
quantities produced or purchased may lead,
in the face of relatively inflexible prices and
wages, to further self-reinforcing changes in
production, purchases, and employmentself-
reinforcing through income effects on
consumption and "accelerator" effects on investment:
perhaps dampened by interest rate
effects on investment, to the extent that the
supply of money does not accommodate
changes in the demand for it.

Indeed, if such patterns of quantity responses
at the level of the firm to unplanned
changes in inventories become standardized-
because such patterns do, in time, reverse
imbalances between production and
sales-it may become entirely rational to
expect such patterns of quantity movements
to occur at a macroeconomic level. Rational
expectations based on such "theories" could
then lead to inventory, production, and
purchase decisions that help to perpetuate the
macroeconomic instability of production, consumption,
and inventories.

Persistent and massive macroeconomic inventory
cycles deny either the existence of
rational expectations, or, more plausibly, the
ability of such expectations to stabilize output
and employment. As the persistence of
such cycles comes to be expected, and their
amplitude to be accepted, it is not surprising
that full flexibility of prices comes to be seen


### ---Economics-1983-0-11.txt---
by many firms as a useless and unprofitable
course of conduct.

V. The Demand for Commodities and
the Demand for Labor

I referred earlier to the case (exemplified
by fresh flowers) in which the holding of
inventories is by definition impossible, and
in which the entire response to unexpected
shifts in supply or demand must be a price
change-at least, given perfectly competitive
markets. This case may be only a trivial
curiosity when we deal with commodities.
But it is a matter of considerable importance
when we recognize that an inability to store
output is, by definition, the case for services-
whether they are final products, or
are services used in production. The largest
class of services, of course, is the labor
services used for the production of goods. If
the price of labor services was a flexible,
continually market-determined price, the
price of labor services should respond rather
sharply to random shocks to the demand for
goods produced using labor. Indeed, prices
of labor should, in general, be more variable
than prices of commodities, on the reasonable
assumption that the supply of labor is
less price elastic than the supply of cooperating
factors of production."

In fact, of course, the evidence is undeniable
that wage rates normally fluctuate far
less than do prices. This anomaly seems to
require an "institutional" explanation, or,
more fundamentally, a theory that explains
the institutions that produce these results.
Such explanations often run in terms of
" set-up," "transactions," and "information"
costs, that make implicit or explicit contracts
mutually beneficial both to workers and to
employers, despite the fact that such contracts
necessarily imply substantial intermittent
unemployment, as well as occasional
labor shortages.12 An extensive literature has
developed along these lines, greatly advanced
in Arthur Okun's posthumous Prices and
Quantities: A Macroeconomic Analysis. The
conclusion of Okun's analysis, of course, is
that models of the labor market that assume
continuous market clearing- and therefore
continuous full employment-are erroneous.
And, as a result, critiques of government
stabilization policy-as powerless to improve
economic welfare even when properly used
(or unable to damage the national interest
when badly used)-necessarily fail.
VI. A Price-Theoretic Version of
the Business Cycle

One well-known critique of stabilization
policy is that associated with Robert Lucas
and Robert Barro. However, Lucas and Barro
accept the reality of a business cycle, involving
serially-correlated changes in real output,
although they still deny the ability of monetary
or fiscal policy to affect the economy.
The price-theoretic approach of Lucas and
Barro stands, however, at an opposite pole
from that of Okun. For instead of trying to
model the imperfect flexibility of wage rates
in a real world, wages are sometimes assumed
not to exist. In one version (1977) of
Lucas' theory of the business cycle, we have
a world reminiscent of J. B. Say, in which
there are no firms, no hired labor, but only
"yeoman farmers."'3 Thus, there are only
prices and profits-no wage rates. Actually,
this model could also accommodate simple
manufacturers- craftsmen without hired
workers-as did the model world of Say.
Needless to say, competition is perfect, and
information free and nearly complete.
1 " To be sure, the presumed rational expectations
response to fluctuations in the demand for commodities,
through planned additions to inventories or the drawing-
down of inventories, would tend also to stabilize the
demand for labor. However, given the costs of commodity
storage, it can easily be shown that this response is
consistent with the presumption stated in the text: that
labor prices should fluctuate more than goods prices.
12On the other hand, the explicitly or implicitly
contractual nature of the employment relationship not
only contributes to the explanation of wage rate insensitivity,
but also allows producers greater freedom to use
temporary layoffs, along with inventory changes, as a
means of adjustment to temporary fluctuations in the
demand for output in a manner which may be economically
efficient both for workers and for employers. The
relationship between inventory behavior and the demand
for labor has recently been interestingly explored
by Robert Topel.

13As Blinder and Fischer have recently characterized
the producers in this model.


### ---Economics-1983-0-12.txt---
However, this very simple world has a
central bank, or its ruler has a printing press.
When bank loans or printing press money
are used to finance a public purpose (such as
an increment in the Prince's consumption)
goods prices are bid up. However, each yeoman
farmer or craftsman is likely to confuse
the rise in his own selling price as a rise in
his price relative to prices for the products
and services of other yeomen. Such relative
price changes occur for various reasons, and
are familiar to each of them. Each therefore
works harder in the presence of inflation,
and produces more, so as to permit him to
consume more of the output of his fellow
farmers or craftsmen, whose prices he presumes
not to have risen. Of course, the Prince
has already consumed more of their output,
too; and their prices, too, have risen, But
until each yeoman discovers that the rise in
his price is general rather than relative, real
GNP increases. Soon, however, each learns
that there has been no increase in his real
price, and finds only the sour taste of inflation.
The boom ends. It can be repeated as
soon as the short memories of all citizens are
erased. 14

What can this have to do with the business
cycle in a world in which yeoman farmers
and craftsmen are replaced by firms with
hired employees? Very little, I think. For, in
even the simplest possible version of this
more familiar world, there have to be two
kinds of prices, not one: prices for goods,
and prices for labor. Increased production
now requires increased inputs not only from
proprietors, but also from their workers. Under
standard price theory, in order for
employers to wish to hire more labor services,
they must believe that product prices have
risen relative to wages; but in order for existing
workers to respond to inflation by
working longer hours, and other potential
workers to enter the labor force, requires
that they interpret what happens as a rise in
the ratio of wages to prices. It was a nice
enough trick to be able to fool each yeoman
about his own real price; but it is an even
nicer trick for an inflation to fool both employers
and workers- in opposite directions
-about the movement of the real wage
paid by one and received by the other!'5
I suggest that more may be learned about
cycles from Knut Wicksell's discussion of
business fluctuations, seventy-five years earlier.
Wicksell understood that, even in a similarly
simple world, there needed to be not
merely one kind of price level-nor merely
two kinds-but actually three: price levels
for goods, for labor, and for loans. And
whether or not there was a Prince with a
printing press, there were competitive banks,
aggressively lending at a flexible price to
businesses. Given a plausible (although incompletely
specified) lag structure, Wicksell
showed that banks' competition in money
creation might initially reduce the price for
loans; and their continuing money creation
might keep it depressed for a time. Through
this means, investment, financed by bank
credit, could exceed ex ante saving, crowding
out consumption. The result, of course, was
also inflation, unanticipated by all. Once the
limits of money creation were reached, the
boom collapsed.

At roughly the same time, in another part
of Europe, J. A. Schumpeter was describing
a rather different source of instability. His
bourgeois prince- the innovating entrepreneur-
driven by new technological, managerial,
or marketing ideas that promised
abnormal profits, repeatedly upset the general
equilibrium: accommodated, of course,
by an elastic banking system. To be sure, his
entrepreneurial activities-his "creative destruction"
-would soon generate an inflation
that had to subside before the next
wave of innovation might again disturb the
economy.

'41n another version (Lucas, 1975), there are genuine
firms selling products and purchasing labor and capital
inputs; but production is scattered among noncommunicating
islands, using capital that is immobile and
labor that is randomly mobile (between periods), while
increments of money are distributed stochastically
among the separated markets from period to period.
This schema permits changes in money to create fluctuations
of real output (of capital goods); but it is not at all
clear (to me) why or how the postulated source of such
"cycles" bears any relationship to the cycles of the "real
world."


### ---Economics-1983-0-13.txt---
Of course, the disturbances of macroeconomic
equilibrium that were visualized by
Wicksell and Schumpeter, and by Fredrich
von Hayek, R. G. Hawtrey, D. H. Robertson,
the early Keynes (and so many others)
were, in the end, mainly disturbances of the
price level, although they normally left a
permanent legacy of a larger capital stock,
newer technology, and increased human
capital.'6 However, most of these pioneers
recognized that the price level did not automatically,
instantaneously, and proportionately
reflect every change in the stock of
money or the output of goods; for instance,
many recognized that prices did not fall sufficiently
promptly in recessions to avoid nonfrictional
unemployment of labor and/or

machines. And such unemployed resources
then permitted a subsequent expansion of
real output, once the next boom began.
VII. Price-Theoretic Models of
Aggregate Investment

Most business cycle theories-or, more
broadly, most macroeconomic theories of the
"medium run"-from the time of Wicksell
or even earlier, have thus been built on
more-or-less elaborate price-theoretical considerations,
related essentially to investment;
and mainly to fixed investment. For, clearly,
it is investment-not consumption or proprietors'
labor-that is the primary source of
medium-run macroeconomic disturbance and
instability. Although (as noted earlier) sharp
fluctuations in the rate of investment in inventories
contribute more to U.S. business
cycle recessions and to the early stages of
business recoveries than do fluctuations in
plant-and-equipment investment, the latter
typically contribute significantly more to expansions
of GNP from cyclical troughs to
peaks than does inventory accumulation.
Moreover, in the medium and longer run,
fluctuations in inventories are governed by
most of the same factors that govern plant
and equipment expenditures.

There are many price levels-relative price
levels-important for investment in plant,
equipment, and normal inventories. They include:


1) The price level for loans: some particular
rate of interest, or some average of rates,
at which investment can be financed;
2) The demand-price level of new capital
goods, reflecting their physical productivity,
the prices of the goods produced by their
use, and the supply-prices of cooperating
factors of production;

3) The supply-price level for new capital
goods, sometimes taken as a function of their
rate of production;

4) The supply-price and the demand-price
levels of entrepreneurship and innovation;
5) The supply-price levels of risk and/or
uncertainty bearing, by investors and lenders;
6) The level and nature of the prices
imposed by government; taxes and their structure;
and

7) The price level of ownership of existing
enterprises; that is, the level of share
prices.

The question is not which among these
price levels are relevant for investment: all of
them (and others) are doubtless relevant to
some degree. Rather, the question is: which
are "strategically" important? Which are the
price levels, the changes in one or more of
which relative to another or others are primarily
responsible-in the real world-for
macroeconomic stability or instability, real
and nominal?

I can illustrate the wide variety of price
theoretic explanations of investment by reference
to three familiar but quite different
examples. 7

16For effective summaries of these and related theories,
see Gottfried Haberler. Hayek (and others of the
"Austrians") denied that there were any positive legacies
from the boom.

17However, not all macroeconomic investment theories
have been or are price theoretical. Examples of
quantity-theoretic investment theories are the following:
(a) Robert Eisner's adaptation of the accelerator theory,
which, in practice, makes real investment, and thus
employment and income, depend on fluctuations in
current levels of real "permanent" business sales (analogous
to permanent income); (b) The works of W. H. L.
Anderson, James Duesenberry, and others, whose emphases
have mainly been on factors influencing the gross
flow of internal funds for investment financing, including
tax rates seen as a determinant of internal fundsavailability
rather than of profitability; and (c) Keynes
and George Katona, who stressed political, sociological,


### ---Economics-1983-0-14.txt---
I remind you of Martin Feldstein's complex
analyses of the interaction of tax laws
and inflation as affecting the profitability
of investment. Alternatively, there is Dale
Jorgenson's "neoclassical" investment theory,
which carefully models the relationship
among all of the prices and quantities that
enter into dynamic profit-maximizing investment
decisions.'8

As a third example, there is James Tobin's
theory, suggested by Keynes, that focuses on
the relationship between the aggregate market
value of the marketable debt and equity
claims against existing enterprises, and the
aggregate cost of reproducing, at today's
prices, the assets of those enterprises. The
ratio of these two global magnitudes has
come to be designated as "q."

I propose to conclude these comments on
price-theoretical explanations of investment
with a few remarks on the q theory. The
Keynes-Tobin approach makes the volume
of aggregate investment dependent upon
-indeed, ordinarily taken as proportional
to-the excess of q over 1: where q is the
ratio of the market value of enterprises to the
replacement cost of their assets. The market
value of enterprises includes the value both
of equities and debts, as currently priced in
security markets; the replacement cost of
their assets is the reproduction cost of existing
plant, equipment, and inventories at current
price levels."9

However formulated in detail, the q theory
of course employs much of the same information
that is used in other macroeconomic
theories of investment. For example, most
investment theories incorporate a bondmarket
interest yield, presumably to represent
the cost of borrowed long-term funds,
or the alternate return on owned funds. Some
investment theories may use short-term interest
rates, as well, to represent the cost of
(or the alternative return on) funds borrowed
to finance inventories or other working
capital, or to finance the purchase of capital
goods while awaiting more favorable rates in
the long-term market. The q theory incorporates
interest rates as they affect the value of
marketable debt claims against enterprises.
This use of interest rates in the q theory is
thus conventional in investment theory.
What is essentially unique about the q
formulation is its inclusion of the market
value of stocks: the price level of ownership
of corporations. This can be thought of as an
indirect measure of the cost (or opportunity
cost) of equity funds.20 Given the typical
volatility of share prices, medium-run movements
of q are often or perhaps ordinarily
dominated by changes in the prices and thus
the market value of outstanding shares.
With that in mind, let me recall to you my
earlier discussion of the speculative demand
for and supply of storable commodities-
gold was the specific example. You
recall my borrowing Keynes' parable of the
beauty contest to describe such markets. You
also recall that this parable was, in fact,
Keynes' analogy for the price determination
of equities.

In recent years, economists have been paying
greatly increased attention to stock
prices-a subject largely avoided by economists
after the debacle, in and after 1929,
both of share prices and of economists' forecasts
of share prices. The revival of
economists' interest in stocks has involved
the development and application of the
"capital asset pricing model" and associated
"portfolio theories," and, most recently, the
attempted application of rational expectations
theory to stock prices.


### ---Economics-1983-0-15.txt---
However, Robert Shiller's recent paper
"Do Stock Prices Move Much Too Much to
be Justified by Subsequent Changes in Dividends?
" appears to demolish the possibility
that movements of U.S. stock prices can be
explained by the rational expectations of
share holders.2' For over a century, real stock
prices appear to have fluctuated far more
than any plausible change in the rational
expectation of real dividends or earnings.
Shiller does not attempt to characterize the
source of the greatly excessive volatility of
stock prices. But, surely, it is possible that
speculative price bubbles, upward or downward,
based upon the extrapolation of nominal
share-price levels and movements, and
on the effort to profit (or to avoid loss) from
such movements, supply some part of the
explanation. Another piece of the explanation
for recent stock prices may well be
Franco Modigliani's and Richard Cohn's
"inflation-illusion" theory-itself clearly inconsistent
with rational expectations.

The rational expectations theory, at least
as applied to individual commodities, assumes
that there exists, at all times, some
long-run equilibrium price-that price which
would equate amounts produced and consumed.
Market participants can and do have
at least a rough idea of what this price is;
moreover, their individual estimates of this
price are basically similar, for all have essentially
the same information, and use essentially
the same model of how that price is
determined.

Those who attempt to apply the concept
of rational expectations to the stock market
rarely state their understanding of what is
the equilibrium price level for shares-or of a
particular share-that it would be rational
for participants to expect. Is it the level of
share prices at which net new issues of shares
would be zero? Or would it be the level of
share prices at which net private investment
would be zero? The level at which net private
investment would equal net saving at full
employment? The level at which investment
might maintain the economy on a Golden
Rule growth path? Or is there some concept
of a less-fundamental, less-long-run equilibrium
level of share prices which market
participants can be expected to understand
and quantitatively approximate? If there is
no such concept of equilibrium share-price
level, how can there be a unique rational
expectation of share prices?

A simpler course is to admit that we have
no very precise concept of an equilibrium
level of share prices, but to argue that we can
nevertheless predict the direction and rate of
movement over time of that equilibrium,
whatever it may be. The rate of movement
might, for example, be expected to approximate
the rate of growth of profits or of
dividends per share. (This was Shiller's device.
) This may suffice for rough tests of the
ex post rationality of historical share price
movements. But it offers essentially zero
guidance to the purchaser or seller of a
particular stock at a particular time. He must
guess whether the prices of particular stocks
will rise or fall, over some less than infinite
horizon, from where they stand today. Is it
strange that he is more concerned with the
correctness of his guess about what other
buyers and sellers are expecting will happen
to prices of those particular shares, and to
the market averages? Is there a better description
than the "beauty contest" parable?
Actually, Keynes' description of the determination
of stock prices is far more detailed
and substantive than I have here described
it, and I recommend its occasional
rereading. However, there is no reason to
suppose that Keynes in 1935 had the last
word on stock prices. Henry Wallich, an
acute observer, who began his distinguished
career on Wall Street, has recently written
about the "Radical Revisions of the Distant
Future" that occur from time to time in the

the professionalization of the securities
business. Very likely this tends to homogenize
views, increasing the herd instinct
among bulls and bears, respectively.
The rewards/penalties system

for professionals works in that direction.
It is dangerous to be wrong in
support of an unpopular cause....
Professionals have made the market
efficient, in the narrow sense that there
is nothing of predictive value to be
learned from the past data of the
market. It is far from clear that they
have made it rational. There may be
something to be learned from the history
of mass delusions in the market
after all. [p. 38]

Modigliani and Cohn's suggestion may be
one such systematic mass delusion.
As one close to retirement, and one of
quite a number of us (I suspect) who have
left most of our retirement resources tied up
in CREF, I would of course, be pleased if
stock prices should return closer to their
average past relationship to earnings or dividends.
But I would not, I confess, find it a
confirmation of the rationality of my own
expectations. Personally, I long ago decided
that being an economist was not merely no
advantage, but probably a disadvantage in
the security markets; and I have never personally
participated in them. I have been
fearful, I suppose, of succumbing, myself, to
the herd instincts that I seem to observe
there. The broker who tells his customers
that Joe Granville is stupid, but that they
must pay attention to him because others
will, both assumes and encourages behavior
only one level removed from that of lemmings.


Because stock prices are not fully rational,
either in the large or even in the small,
sharp-eyed members of several generations
of my graduate students learned (not from
me) to support themselves in reasonable
comfort by playing on trivial systematic
anomalies that they had found in share price
movements. They succeeded, presumably, by
acting exactly as others do, but a trifle sooner.
Indeed, the lemming instinct affects participants
in other markets. One current example
is that of the international bankers,
whose loans to particular LDCs were safe
because-but only so long as-other international
bankers recognized exactly the same
source of safety.

Whether one describes investment decisions
in terms of the q formulation or in
some other way, prices in security markets
necessarily affect the volume of aggregate
investment. And, because such prices are
clearly not fully rational, investment is a
potential and actual source of exogenous disturbance
of macroeconomic equilibrium; and
successful government stabilization policies
are not, by definition, precluded.
Our stroll along the border between microand
macroeconomics comes to an end. What
can we conclude? I conclude that the rational
expectations model of economic behavior
adequately describes an important range
of economic activities, where prices adjust
smoothly and efficiently to clear markets and
to stabilize production and consumption over
time. But rational expectations do not adequately
explain other kinds of markets, where
speculative prices may systematically tend to
overshoot changing equilibrium levels: nor
yet another kind-including most labor
markets and many "customers markets"
-where price changes tend systematically to
undershoot changing equilibrium levels,
whether because of an inability to develop
efficient long-term contracts, the existence of
bilateral monopoly, or merely because of the
rapid pace of unpredictable technological,
institutional, or other exogenous change. All
of the resulting aberrant forms of microeconomic
behavior may in some sense be individually
"rational"; yet their macroeconomic
effects are often perverse.

Nevertheless, we economists do our best
to understand our world, and to discover
those dependable regularities of behavior
-whether or not fully rational-that provide
the basis for economics theories, which
we can then use to prescribe policies, whether
these policies are of laissez-faire or of selective
intervention. All forms of dependably
regular behavior that we seek to discover and
to describe-and not merely those that are
fully rational-are equally important parts
of the social science of Economics, that
Marshall once defined simply as "a study of

. .. [T]he world may have its reasons for
being non-Walrasian.

Robert Solow

The vast majority of our profession share
a common view on most microeconomic
policy issues. But we are widely split over
macroeconomic theory and policy. Our concensus
on micro issues arises from a shared
model of how markets work in the long run.
Our division on macro issues stems from a
number of reasons, the emphasis on which
has shifted over the years. In recent times the
main disagreement has centered on how
markets perform in the short run. In particular,
we cannot agree on why nominal wages
are sticky on the face of aggregate demand
shocks. The traditional view argues that
wages are structurally sticky. The new classical
macroeconomists argue that wages are
fundamentally flexible. But the rational expectations
of economic agents, grounded on
past experience with attempts at employment-
supporting monetary policy, have produced
the observed wage stickiness. Introduction
of a changed policy regime, based on
a stable growth path for the money supply or
some similar rule, would-so the argument
goes-eventually change the pattern of expectations
and eliminate the stickiness.

A large and rapidly expanding body of
recent research on implicit contracts, principal-
agent relationships, and related subjects
has begun to flesh out our knowledge of
why wages are sticky. Almost universally the
implicit contract and related literature concludes
that optimal behavior implies a good
deal less wage flexibility in the face of changes
in the marginal revenue product of labor
than would occur in the spot auction markets
of the Walrasian model. But this literature
deals with the stickiness of real and relative
wages in response to shocks of various kinds.
It seems to have little to say about the macroeconomic
stickiness of nominal wages. A
micro theory of real wage stickiness may
help explain the difficulty of adjusting to
sudden large changes in aggregate supply
conditions like the two oil shocks of the
1970's. But the more familiar problems facing
macroeconomic theory and policy have
to do with the ability of the economy to
adjust to aggregate demand shocks where
nominal wage stickiness is a major barrier to
successful adjustment. And here the important
question is what, if anything, does
the new research imply for the behavior of
nominal wages? It is to this subject I want to
give my attention.

A road map will be helpful. After summarizing
the existing literature, the first
section concentrates on relative wage adjustments,
and argues that under optimal

arrangements for the determination of wages,
relative wages while not rigid will be sticky.
They will adjust only gradually to relative
changes in the conditions facing individual
firms. The paper then argues that contrary to
general opinion, relative wage stickiness necessarily
produces aggregate nominal wage
stickiness; if wages move sluggishly in response
to the relative conditions facing individual
firms, they will move sluggishly in
response to aggregate nominal shocks. Several
mechanisms that might produce a flexible
wage response to nominal shocks, given sticky
relative wages, are considered and rejected
-various forms of indexing and rational
expectations. Finally the "external" nature
of the gains from nominal wage flexibility
is invoked against the criticism that attributing
cyclical unemployment to nominal wage
stickiness implies nonrational behavior on


### ---Economics-1985-0-04.txt---
the part of employers and workers. Macroeconomic
shocks will gradually overcome the
relative wage stickiness and move the aggregate
nominal wage level in the desired direction,
but the transitional costs are large.
I. Some Relevant Features of the Implicit
Contract Literature

By now the literature on implicit contracts
is so large and so diverse that I cannot do it
justice in a brief summary. But it is necessary
to sketch out a few elements of that research,
paying particular attention to several key
features that bear on the relationship between
wage behavior and aggregate demand
shocks.

The flexible-price, market-clearing model,
in which economic agents are price takers
and prompt quantity adjusters, would be a
useful paradigm in a very particular kind of
world. In this world labor and product
markets would be characterized by a great
deal of homogeneity, and so individual transactions
would be carried on in very "thick"
markets. There would be no reason for preserving
a continuity of relationships between
workers and firms, customers and suppliers,
lenders and borrowers. Workers would be
interchangeable; the marginal revenue product
of a particular class of workers would be
the same regardless of the firm to which the
worker was attached. Either labor effort could
be easily monitored or it would be completely
proportional to labor hours paid for.
And, wherever commitments had to be made
for the future, expectations about the important
variables entering into the decision
could be drawn from fixed stochastic distributions,
knowledge of which, in turn, could
be derived from the recurrent nature of past
events. As well as being unbiased, forecasts
could significantly improve on coin-flips.
The world that we are trying to model,
however, is in fact different in several fundamental
ways. Most importantly, in a

substantial part of the economy there are
large returns to maintaining the continuity of
association between workers and firms.
Workers acquire nontransferable, firmspecific
skills; and some of the cost of the
acquisition may be paid by the firm. They
acquire knowledge about the nonwage attributes
of a job through experience on thal
job. Continuity of association also provides
firms with hard-to-come-by knowledge about
the reliability and productivity of specific
workers. Additional transition, search, and
moving costs are incurred by workers and
firms when the association is broken. Substantial
bilateral monopoly rents to continuity
are thus generated among firms and their
experienced work force.

Risk aversion introduces another reason
for continuity of association. For at least
some range of possible variations in the economic
environment facing a firm, it is likely
to be less risk averse than its workers. But
the relevant insurance contracts cannot be
traded separately from employment contracts,
and so continuity of association becomes
a joint product with insurance. Finally,
in the real world, labor time is not
synonymous with performance. Monitoring
worker performance or effort is costly, but
the payment of higher than the "going wage"
will bind workers to the firms with an incentive
to avoid shirking. And the particular
workers who "survive" the monitoring are
those who have found the premium sufficient
to avoid monitorable shirking, a piece of
valuable information to the firm flowing from
continuity of association.

Realizing the benefits from long-term
worker-firm relationships requires, of course,
some sort of explicit or implicit agreement
between employers and workers on the terms
of the relationship, especially with respect to
wages and employment opportunities. Several
problems in modeling these long-term worker-
firm agreements have dominated the recent
literature. First, when the marginal revenue
product of labor changes, how are wages
and employment to be adjusted while still
preserving contractual relationships? Second,
since firms are much better able than workers
to observe the marginal product of labor and
since contingent contracts directly tied to the
various states of nature cannot practically be
designed, how can contract terms allow for
some flexibility in meeting changing conditions
without giving employers incentives
to provide false information about labor's
marginal product? This is the problem of


### ---Economics-1985-0-05.txt---
asymmetric information and has given rise to
the modeling of incentive-compatible contracts.
Third, since explicit written contracts
between unions and employers cover only a
small part of the workers involved in longterm
relationships, what keeps either workers
or firms from violating the implicit agreement
or exploiting their half of bilateral monopoly
situations when conditions are favorable
to do so? Analysis of this issue has
given rise to the concept of a firm's labor
market "reputation," or brand-name capital,
fear of losing which provides an enforcement
constraint. This is the problem of enforcement.


Three major strands of the literature on
implicit contracts can be discerned, each of
which emphasizes one of the rationales for
the continuity of association (without necessarily
denying the existence of other aspects),
and each of which deals somewhat differently
with the problems cited in the prior
paragraph.' The earliest version of implicit
contracts emphasized the role of risk aversion,
firms being either risk neutral or less
risk averse than workers to fluctuations in
their income.2 Firms thus offer risk-sharing
contracts that improve social welfare relative
to spot auction markets. Another body of
research stresses transactions costs and asset
specificity -that is, the acquisition of firmspecific
skills by workers, and specific and
valuable knowledge about each other by both
firms and workers.3 This approach also emphasizes
the asymmetry of knowledge between
firms and workers about the marginal
revenue product of labor, and its influence
on the nature of the contract. Still a different
emphasis is given in the efficiency wage4
literature to an assumed positive correlation
between the level (or the career profile) of
wages on the one hand and the "effort" or
productivity of workers on the other.5
While there are substantial differences
among these various approaches, they all
conclude that, under optimal contracts, real
wages will be smoothed in the face of changes
in the marginal revenue product of labor
relative to what would be predicted by an
auction market. And all of them provide a
rationale for the existence of ex post Pareto
inefficiency and involuntary unemployment.
II. Some Extensions to Implicit Contract Theory
We can distinguish several categories and
subcategories of changes in economic circumstances,
the wage response to which must
be accommodated by social conventions and
informal understandings that we call implicit
contracts. Let us consider first some of the
implications of contract theory as it deals
with the response of wages to changes in the
relative conditions facing individual firms or
labor markets. For that purpose I define
relative changes to be those which occur on
the assumption that the perceived general
level of opportunities facing workers-call
it W-remains unchanged in real and nominal
terms. (The relevant W is, of course, in
real terms. But since we are here abstracting
from any aggregate disturbances, real and
nominal W are the same.) In turn there are
two kinds of relative changes in economic
conditions that implicit contracts must allow
for; changes which are realizations of a probability
distribution known at the time the
contract is entered, and those stemming from
developments to which no basis could be
found for assigning probabilities.


### ---Economics-1985-0-06.txt---
To deal with implicit labor contracts
covering the long tenures that are typical in
U.S. industry, it is necessary to make the
currently out-of-fashion distinction between
risk and uncertainty. Most of the mathematical
modeling of implicit contracts has assumed
that workers and firms base their
agreements on a known probability distribution
(presumably commonly held) of the relevant
variables, most importantly the marginal
revenue product of labor or some
related variable. The distribution of the mean
expected bilateral monopoly rents from continuity
is decided at the beginning of the
contract on the basis of the known distribution
of possible economic environments that
will be faced over the life of the contract,
and the contract then specifies the behavior
of wages (and in some cases employment) as
the realization of that distribution occurs.
The wage is either rigid or changes sluggishly
in the face of these changing realizations.
But recent research on the surprisingly long
lengths of job tenure in the United States
casts doubt on the usefulness and sufficiency
of this assumption. Robert Hall (1980) has
estimated that, in 1973, half of all work in
America was done on jobs whose completed
tenures were fifteen years or more. And for
men alone the relevant completed job tenure
was twenty-five years! Douglas Wolf and
Frank Levy (1984) reached very similar conclusions
on the basis of a 1979 survey. The
contracts, rules-of-behavior, and social conventions
that make possible such long associations
must be such as to allow wages to
adjust appropriately in response to changes
in circumstances whose probability of occurrence
could not be determined in advance. In
other words, the informal agreements which
make possible long-term association between
workers and employers must take into
account Knightian uncertainty about future
possible outcomes. With respect to many of
possible states of the world, over such a long
period of time, there is no basis in past
statistical regularities for knowing the distribution.
As William Nordhaus (1976) points
out, contracts must take account of changes
in the economic climate (i.e., when the
parameters of the distribution shift) as well
as changes in the economic weather (i.e., as
realizations of the known distribution).
Most of the possible long-term changes to
be faced by firms and workers do not result
from the cyclical variance of aggregates, like
national income and output, but from
changes in relative variables potentially responding
to a bewildering permutation of
possibilities. Seen in 1973, what were the
rationally expected probabilities of the 1974
and 1979 oil price increases, the introduction
and growth of personal computers, or the
Chrysler brush with bankruptcy? Compared
to workers, firms may indeed be relatively
risk neutral to temporary changes in income
following some known distribution. But no
firm is so risk neutral and has such unlimited
access to capital as to enter upon or honor
contacts specifying rigid wages or some fixed
function of wages on employment over very
long periods,6 when no rational basis exists
for specifying the distribution of outcomes.
Some of the modern wage literature (for
example, Hall and David Lilien, 1979; Sanford
Grossman and Oliver Hart, 1981) models
a contract with a "lump-sum" distribution
of the rents-that is, an amount to be
paid the workers regardless of unemployment
status-and a marginal compensation,
paid when the worker is employed and itself
an agreed upon increasing function of the
level of labor input. Employers then determine
employment by maximizing profits
in the light of the marginal compensation
schedule. In these approaches, the climatic
changes to which I refer would be an occasion
for changing the basic lump sum distribution
of the rents.

A workable distinction can thus be made
between those contract provisions which deal
with wages in the face of moderate and
temporary changes in the marginal product
of labor that are perceived as the realization
of a known probability distribution and those
provisions which deal with climatic and permanent
changes, the probability of whose
6Indeed, for contracts covering long periods of time,
workers are probably less risk averse than firms. Under
some range of unfavorable outcomes, rigid wages could
mean bankruptcy for the firm. Against relative changes
in fortunes the worker loses only his "rent" from continuity
plus search costs. And, however well stockholders
may be able to diversify against bankruptcies,
the managers of the firm find it much more difficult.


### ---Economics-1985-0-07.txt---
occurrence cannot be estimated before the
fact. With respect to changes in labor demand
that are perceived to be consistent
with a previously known distribution, implicit
contract theory predicts either rigid
wages or-in the models like those of Hall
and Lilien and Grossman and Hart-wages
which move less than spot auction markets
would predict but are positively correlated
with the level of employment. But the informal
agreements or generally accepted conventions
that we call implicit contracts must
also provide for changes in circumstances
whose probability cannot rationally be estimated
at the time workers enter into the
contract. These climatic changes in economic
circumstances can be of several broad kinds.
They might involve a relatively long-term
change, because of shifts in demand or costs,
in the rents available to be shared by a firm
and its workers. Long-term changes in the
relative demand and supply of particular
occupations or in particular local labor
markets will also call for changes in relative
wages around a given W.

If the present value of the stream of benefits
to workers (wages and employment probabilities)
flowing from continuing with the
firm begins to decline relative to the alternative
combination of initial investment costs
and future rents that can be generated at
other firms, it is appropriate that contract
terms signal the information to workers, so
that they can make the relevant comparisons,
and decide whether to quit the firm. Similarly,
if a substantial and permanent decline
occurs in the relative demand for labor by
occupation or locality, wages ought to signal
the change. Conversely, economic circumstances
might increase the rents to be divided
making it optimal for the firm to enlarge its
share of the relevant labor market pool of
experienced workers. In that case, the signal
of higher relative wages ought to be transmitted
to attract from other firms or occupations
workers for whom the lost rents are less
than the improved opportunities.
An efficient determination of wages must
thus cope with two hard-to-reconcile sets of
facts. Because long continuity of association
between firms and specific workers confers
substantial benefits on both parties, rentsharing
arrangements that offer protection
against exploitation and promote such continuity
are profitable. But the period of association
is so long that the probability distribution
of circumstances requiring changes
in wages is largely unknowable. And so the
rules and conventions governing wage determination
must be flexible enough to allow
response. Seen in this light, the terms "implicit
contract" may be misleading. It is, I
think, useful to think of wages as being
set and periodically revised by firms within
limits imposed by a set of social conventions,
concepts of equity and fairness, and
informal understandings. These conventions,
concepts, and understandings provide substantial,
if imperfect, protection against exploitation
but allow flexibility to deal with
Knightian uncertainty.

While very lengthy association requires
relative wage adjustments in response to
" unforeseeable" changes in circumstances,
other characteristics of the labor market suggest
that those adjustments will tend to be
gradual and delayed. It would be hard to
account for the long job tenures that we
observe unless the combination of positive
returns to association and the cost of transition
were quite sizeable. The quantitative
evidence on the magnitude of explicit turnover
costs suggests that they are large. Daniel
Mitchell and Larry Kimbell (1982), for example,
report a recent estimate, based on a
survey of Los Angeles firms, that firms' own
costs of turnover (exit costs plus replacement
costs) averaged $3,600, $2,300, and $10,400
for production, clerical, and salary-exempt
workers, respectively.

Under these circumstances, erroneous signals
can have asymmetrical results. Changes
in wages undertaken on the mistaken identification
of a temporary change in circumstances
as a permanent change can cause
a substantial loss to workers and firms from
the unnecessary scrapping of "investment"
and the incurring of other turnover costs.
Entire rent streams are wiped out to the
extent that workers having transferred to
other firms cannot return when the mistake
is discovered. Moreover, once experienced
workers do change jobs, it is likely to take
several tries before they find another longtenure
job. Hall (1982), for example, shows
that in 1978 a worker aged 45-49 who was in


### ---Economics-1985-0-08.txt---
a new job had only a 20 percent probability
of holding that job as long as five years.
While the large magnitude of rents for
experienced workers tends to provide some
room for errors, workers are presumably
arranged along a spectrum with respect to
their own evaluation of potential opportunities
elsewhere. As a consequence, the losses
from the errors will be a continuous positive
function of the size of the errors. Errors of
the opposite type-failing to introduce a
contract change to meet a permanent alteration
in the climate-can be reversed at a
much smaller cost. Some workers will have
remained too long with a particular firm,
while a smaller group will have lost income
from the higher layoffs associated with this
type of error. But these losses are likely to be
much smaller than the loss of the rent stream
itself, unless the error persists for a long
time.

Thus, given Knightian uncertainty about
economic conditions over the long length of
job tenures, implicit contracts must allow for
the possibility of relative wage changes in the
face of climatic changes in external conditions.
But the interest of both firms and
workers dictates that those changes occur
only after enough information has been
accumulated to warrant a high probability
forecast that the change is permanent. To
justify a substantial wage adjustment, it is
not sufficient that the firm act on unbiased
forecasts-they must also acquire some confidence
in the accuracy of the forecasts.
One might object to this line of reasoning
on grounds that failure to adjust wages
quickly enough while the evidence is accumulating
that the change in circumstances is
permanent, is itself likely to send out wrong
signals. If, for example, wages are slow to
adjust downward when the demand for labor
falls, employment will decline. Why will
workers not take this as a signal that the
future stream of benefits from staying in the
current job have declined relative to earlier
anticipation? There are a number of reasons
why this objection is not valid. First, a change
in wages is known immediately, while it takes
some time to begin to realize that an actual
change in employment reflects a shift in the
long-term distribution of employment probabilities.
Second, the common practice of
layoffs subject to recall is a way for a firm to
signal that the lower employment is expected
to be temporary. Third, significant downward
changes in relative wages are not lightly
made. Given the inability of workers easily to
assess the magnitude of the available rents,
firms are deterred from exploiting the bilateral
monopoly relationship through the
damage they might do to their "reputations"
and the future increases in employment costs
thereby imposed. Since reputation is a fragile
asset, and since workers are naturally less
likely than firms to interpret current facts as
warranting a relative wage cut, firms must
wait until a substantial body of evidence
points in the required direction. The efficiency
wage literature emphasizes the unfavorable
productivity consequences of relative wage
reductions that turn out to be unwarranted.
And, since firms know that it is difficult to
reduce wages once they have been raised,
they do not want to make a mistake in the
upward direction. As a consequence, wage
changes that survive these barriers are much
more clearly interpreted as a signal that the
stream of future rents has changed than are
variations in employment.

Efficient implicit wage contracts, in the
presence of uncertainty, must also have the
characteristic that they minimize "haggling
costs." They should not lead to a constantly
renewed battle over the division of the rents.
Frequent struggles would waste resources,
possibly reduce productivity, and erode
scarce reputation capital, thereby reducing
the probability of long-tenure associations.
These considerations argue that significant
relative wage adjustments to meet perceived
permanent changes in condition be an infrequent
occurrence and not lightly changed
once made.

In sum, modern contract theory concludes
that relative wages will tend to be quite
sticky in comparison to predictions from the
auction market model, in the face of changes
in conditions that are the realizations of
known probability distributions-what I
have loosely called temporary changes. But
the existence of very lengthy job tenures and
the large gains from continuity suggest that
the social conventions and informal agreements


### ---Economics-1985-0-09.txt---
which we call implicit contracts must
provide for adjustments in wages that move
towards market clearing in response to unforeseeable
permanent changes in relative

economic conditions. Finally, however, the
substantial penalties which can be suffered if
firms and workers respond to erroneous signals
by prematurely severing association call
for informal arrangements and agreements
that produce a very slow and cautious adjustment
of wages even to what ultimately
turn out to be permanent changes in relative
conditions.7

It is not surprising, given the large social
returns to continuity of association and the
very great difficulty of distinguishing temporary
from permanent changes in economic
circumstances, that society should have developed
social conventions and informal
agreements that minimize the sending of premature
signals for a reallocation of resources.


III. Response to Aggregate Demand Shocks
So far we have considered a world in
which only relative or local changes are permitted,
a world in which the nominal and
real value of the general wage level, or the
wage "norm," was fixed. Now impose aggregate
demand shocks on such a world,
optimal adjustment to which requires a
change in the path of average prices and
wages. (For simplicity of exposition we will
be considering only aggregate demand
shocks, and exclude aggregate shocks to the
supply curve, like those arising from OPECimposed
oil price increases or from crop
shortages. We can thus assume that the equilibrium
solution will not call for changes in
aggregate real wages.) An efficient system of
implicit contracts must obviously provide for
adjustments in the nominal wages of individual
firms when changes occur in the average
level of nominal wages, W. Under the social
conventions and understandings which govern
wage determination, there is a rebuttable
presumption that-barring the existence of
circumstances which call for changes in real
and relative wages-nominal wages in each
firm will be adjusted in line with observed
changes in prices and wages generally. But
this process of wage determination does not
generate prompt and flexible adjustment of
aggregate nominal wages to nominal shocks.
A change in the average level of wages is the
product of changes in wages by individual
firms. To the extent that individual wage
adjustments must wait on changes in the
average, aggregate nominal wage flexibility
will not be a characteristic of the system.
And, as discussed below, this is also true, but
to a somewhat lesser degree, of the wage
response to price changes. Given the substantial
costs of sticky nominal wages to
society as a whole and to individual firms
and their workers, is there not some other
adjustment mechanism which would generate
a prompt and flexible nominal wage response,
preserving relative wages but producing
the desired nominal flexibility?
Several lines of inquiry suggest themselves.
First, why are not nominal wages explicitly
indexed to some aggregate nominal indicator,
producing the appropriate change in W
in response to aggregate demand shocks?
Second, even with relative wage stickiness,
would not rational firms and their workers
forecast the ultimate equilibrium change in
W and promptly set individual wages accordingly?
And, finally, if that is not feasible,
why do implicit contracts not permit
swifter and larger nominal wage adjustments
by individual firms under the force of aggregate
nominal shocks?


### ---Economics-1985-0-10.txt---
Let us start with the issue of indexing
wages in individual firms to the general price
level. In the United States, wages are not
widely protected against changes in price by
explicit indexing formulae. In 1983, only 58
percent of union workers were covered by
COLAs. On the average, the ones that were,
received protection against only 53 percent
of the changes in the CPI. Jo Anna Gray
(1978) and Stanley Fischer (1977) examined
the conditions under which indexing would
or would not be optimal for individual firms
given the assumption that wages once set are
not renegotiated for some period. The main
conclusion from this research is that, in the
face of real (as opposed to nominal) shocks,
indexing, by freezing real wages, produces
real wage results that are not optimal for the
firm. Given the probability that nominal and
real shocks are both likely to occur, Gray
shows that partial indexing will be an optimal
choice. Moreover, even nominal shocks
are likely, during the transition to a new
equilibrium, to have nonneutral effects; the
firm's product price and the Consumer Price
Index may not move in parallel. As a consequence,
indexing would have unwanted real
effects even in the face of monetary shocks.
While we have seen that some degree of real
wage stickiness is optimal, the absence of full
indexing even in multiyear union contracts
indicates that the opposite extreme- automatic
guarantees of a fixed real wage over
several years-is not a workable approach.
Within-year indexing is virtually nonexistent
in annual union contracts and in the
annual wage adjustment cycle followed by
the vast bulk of nonunion firms. Under implicit
contracts, changes in the path of average
wages and prices in the economy as a
whole or in relevant submarkets are commonly
agreed to constitute a major element
in determining the size of those annual wage
adjustments. But, in the United States, it is
almost universally the practice not to make
the relationship to the price level or to average
wages an explicit and automatic one,
either within the year or over longer periods.
And, as noted earlier, in those multiyear
union contracts where indexing is found, that
indexing is almost always less than complete.
Haggling costs are apparently minimized by
making periodic wage adjustments that simultaneously
take into account nominal, real,
and relative factors, rather than by fixing the
nominal relationship in a formula and separately
adjusting for changes in real and
relative conditions.

In any event, even if wages were fully
indexed to prices, they would not produce
highly flexible nominal wages in response to
aggregate demand shocks. The cumulative
costs of wage indexing, in the face of real
shocks and the transitional nonneutrality of
nominal shocks, would be severely exacerbated
if the indexing were instantaneous.
As a consequence, the indexing we do observe-
except in countries which have developed
extremely rapid and sustained inflation
-typically involves a substantial lag between
observed price changes and wage adjustments.
Such indexing only guarantees a
gradual response of wages to aggregate demand
shocks in proportion as prices themselves
are flexible in the face of constant
wages. Even if prices were competitively determined,
the economy would still have to
work its way through a series of price-wageprice
reactions in each one of which prices
fell, relative to wages, by an amount depending
on the slope of the marginal cost curves.
And prices do not move with such frequency
or flexibility. Arthur Okun (1981) has carefully
elaborated the reasons why, in the
customer markets which predominate in
modern economies, prices are not likely to
move quickly and easily up and down a
marginal cost curve. Robert Gordon (1981)
has elaborated how the highly articulated
input-output relationships of modern economies
tend to slow the price reaction to aggregate
demand shocks. And George Akerlof
and Janet Yellen (1984) have recently shown
that in less than perfectly competitive markets
inertial price-setting behavior in response to
a shock may impose only second-order losses
on the firms who follow such behavior, even
though the macro result may be first-order
losses for the economy.8 Everything else
8Technically the Akerlof-Yellen proposition applies
to situations in which agents' objective functions are
differentiable in their own prices and wages-a condition
that is not met in the competitive model, but is met
in a wide range of other market models.

being equal, indexing wages to prices would
provide some nominal wage flexibility in the
face of nominal shocks. But if wages are
otherwise sticky, indexing them to prices
would still yield a very gradual iterative process
of demand inflation or disinflation.
Granted the obstacles to indexing wages to
prices in implicit contracts, and the insufficiency
of that arrangement-even if

feasible-to produce prompt nominal wage
adjustments, why are not implicit contracts
indexed to some aggregate like nominal GNP
or the money supply? Such an arrangement
might seem to be a way to approximate the
role of the Walrasian auctioneer, automatically
generating W at a level to clear the
aggregate supply-demand balance, while relative
wages continued to be set under implicit
contracts along lines suggested earlier.
In fact, of course, we observe no such
arrangement anywhere in the world, and a
little thought supplies a number of reasons.
For purposes of indexing wage contracts to
nominal GNP, some agreed-upon process
would have to be found for separating "disturbances"
in nominal GNP from the trend

increases consistent with full employment at
a stable inflation rate. Anything that altered
the parallel growth of average and marginal
labor productivity, or the growth of full employment
labor inputs, would change the
trend and require the contracts to be renegotiated.
Robert Gordon (1981, 1983) has
identified a number of reasons, why, even if
the appropriate split could be made between
trend and disturbances, indexing wages to
nominal GNP would not be feasible in implicit
contracts. If prices themselves are not
completely flexible relative to wages, declines
in nominal GNP under an indexed system
would produce long periods with unwarranted
real wage decreases. And, since the
costs and hence the prices of the typical large
firm depend on the costs and prices of a long
and heterogeneous chain of suppliers, indexing
wages on nominal GNP would only index
part of an individual firm's costs.
Workers would rightly be skeptical that such
an indexing system would quickly move
prices down proportionally with wages.
The problems of automatic indexing to
some other nominal aggregate, like the money
supply, are even worse since the relationship
between any other aggregate variable
and the equilibrium full employment wage
level is still more complex and unstable than
it is in the case of nominal GNP. And unless
all firms could somehow agree on a common
translation formula for indexing purposes,
nominal demand shocks would produce a
wide dispersion of unwarranted changes in
relative wages. (This point is elaborated further
in the paragraphs that follow.) More
complex explicit indexing formulas can be
imagined, but are no more feasible than simple
ones. The two parties to a contract would
be subjecting themselves to very great uncertainty
in agreeing to a given information set
and forecasting model as the basis for the
indexing. It takes a very large run of data
to sort systematic error from noise in economic
time-series. And so agents would have
huge space for disagreement about the appropriate
information set and the relevant
model for translating information into forecasts.
Alternative choices could lead to biased
outcomes, whose bias could not be determined
for a very long time. (The appropriate
order in which to enter variables in
a vector autoregression model is hardly the
subject for fruitful labor negotiations.) In
short, feasible state-contingent contracts cannot
be designed to replace the Walrasian
auctioneer as a means of coordinating the
system's response to nominal shocks.9
In the absence of explicit state-contingent
contracts, can nominal wage flexibility be
rescued by a rational expectations model of
wage determination? Why do not individual
firms and their workers rationally forecast
the change in the equilibrium path of average
wages (W) expected to result from a
nominal shock, and promptly change wages
accordingly, recognizing that their actions
involve no decision to change relative wages?


### ---Economics-1985-0-12.txt---
Stochastic errors in forecasting could generate
temporary wage "errors" and departures
of employment from its natural rate. But
nominal wages would fundamentally be
flexible.

A rational expectations approach to the
determination of the aggregate nominal wage
and price level, however, cannot simply be
carried over into a world of sticky relative
wages. There are several reasons why this is
so. In the first place, in the new classical
model it is not the expectational element
that generates aggregate nominal wage flexibility.
Rather, a prompt response of aggregate
nominal wages to nominal shocks is
guaranteed by the perfect ex ante flexibility
of relative wages in auction markets. In these
models a downward nominal demand shock
generates a prompt and "neutral" change in
the path of nominal wages precisely because
of individual workers' presumed willingness
to underbid wages, shading their bids and
offers in the face of excess supplies, to the
point where markets are cleared. In the auction-
market model, workers or groups of
workers are willing to accept lower wages in
the face of excess supply even when errors in
expectations lead them to misperceive the
entire wage cut as a relative one. In the event
of such misperceptions, some labor supply is
withdrawn but nominal wages still fall. And
as soon as the misperception is corrected,
wages quickly fall by the remaining amount
necessary to eliminate excess labor supply
and clear labor markets. In the world of
implicit contracts I have described earlier,
however, the absence of substantial relative
wage flexibility eliminates this basis for
prompt nominal wage flexibility.
In the absence of auction markets with
their relative wage flexibility, the achievement
of aggregate nominal wage flexibility
becomes a prisoner's dilemma problem. But,
since wages are not completely rigid under
implicit contracts, it is not possible that individual
firms and their workers forecast the
ultimate equilibrium response of average
wages to nominal shocks, promptly adjust
their own wages to it and thereby solve the
prisoner's dilemma in favor of nominal wage
flexibility? I think not. Two key features of
implicit contracts interact with one central
feature of rational forecasts to reduce sharply
the feasibility of commonly shared expectations
about the equilibrium W as a surrogate
for Arrow-Debreu contingent claims contracts.
First, firms are wage setters, not wage
takers; second, frequent haggling over wage
changes is very costly to the development of
mutually beneficial long-term relationships
between workers and firms; and third, forecasts
of equilibrium wage and price levels are
subject to substantial stochastic error and
forecast outcomes are likely to be widely
distributed over the population of wage-setting
firms.

In a world of auction markets, the fact
that forecasts of individual agents are widely
distributed around the "true" mean is for
most purposes irrelevant. In his seminal
article (1961), John Muth pointed out that
cross-sectional differences in expectations
posed no problem for the theory because
their aggregate effect would be negligible so
long as deviations from the rational forecast
by individual firms were not strongly correlated
with each other. In auction markets,
specific prices or wages are not determined
by individual forecasts. But, in a world of
implicit contracts with firms as wage setters,
they would be. The dispersion of individual
forecasts concerning the equilibrium nominal
wage W, and therefore the dispersion of individual
wage decisions, would often be a wide
one. Robert Lucas' words about the role of
rational expectations in shaping the actions
of economic agents are relevant in this regard:


Neither will [rational expectations] be
applicable in situations in which one
cannot guess which, if any, observable
frequencies are relevant: situations
which Knight called 'uncertainty'. It
will most likely be useful in situations
in which the probabilities of interest
concern a fairly well defined recurrent
event, situations of 'risk' in Knight's
terminology. [1977, p. 15]

Changes in the path of nominal wages, however,
have not simply, or even primarily,
been driven by recurrent patterns of endogenous


### ---Economics-1985-0-13.txt---
events, at least in recent years. The
Vietnam War, two massive oil shocks, the
introduction of floating exchange rates, and
the institution of a new monetary regime in
the United States in 1979 have dominated
events. Even if the vast majority of firms
held a broadly similar view of the way the
economic world works, the very great macroeconomic
uncertainty and the stochastic
variance of prior forecasts around the actual
outcomes would guarantee a wide dispersion
of individual forecasts whenever large shocks
occurred.

A wide dispersion of the forecasts of individual
economic agents and the experience of
errors in prior forecasts would have a
number of consequences. In the first place,
given the large room for disagreements about
the forecast, we have to rule out on moral
hazard grounds implicit contracts under
which workers, prior to actually observing
a deterioration in employment conditions,
would accept employer forecasts of a declining
equilibrium nominal wage as the basis
for a downward wage adjustment. But even
waiving this difficulty, the large dispersion of
individual forecasts would result in widespread
unintended relative wage changes,
even if all firms and their workers accepted a
wage adjustment based on the firm's equilibrium
forecasts. Because of both risk aversion
and the consequences to firms and
workers that follow from erroneous signals,
these changes could impose significant losses
on the parties. Yet, a high frequency of wage
changes is also costly, so that errors would
tend to persist for some time. Indeed, given
the incompleteness and imperfections of
current information, and the murkiness of
the variable being forecast-the equilibrium
nominal wage level-there would be substantial
room for disagreement among the
parties as to whether or not a prior forecast
had or had not been in error. Finally, to the
extent that "bad" experience with forecasts
caused some firms and workers to reduce the
forward-looking element in wage setting, the
unreliability of forecasts for those who used
them would become greater. It would become
increasingly less rational to base individual
wage decisions on the assumption that
others were forecasting the equilibrium
adjustment and promptly adjusting wages
accordingly. Thus, without the "policing"
mechanism of relative wage flexibility, a system
that relied on rational expectations forecasts
of the equilibrium wage outcome would
be unstable.

In sum, under implicit contracts, widespread
tying of individual wage decisions to
expectations about equilibrium aggregate
wage outcomes is not a feasible way of anticipating
the optimal adjustment to nominal
shocks. The policing mechanism of ex ante
relative wage flexibility is absent, so that
nominal wage flexibility becomes a prisoner's
dilemma problem. And prompt rational
expectations "indexing" to the equilibrium
outcome is no solution to that problem, since
it would increase haggling costs, produce
unwanted relative wage changes, and become
increasingly an irrational action on the part
of individual firms.

In the absence of widespread indexing
to some nominal aggregate, or to the rational
expectation of the equilibrium wage norm
W, wages must find their way to a lower level
as the product of specific decisions among
individual firms and their workers, in a process
constrained by the same social conventions
and informal agreements that dictate
the change in relative wages under implicit
contracts. In a world of price and wage
setters, firms and workers observe demand
shocks principally in the form of changes in
their own physical quantities- sales first and
then output and employment-and in the
context, initially, of an unchanged perceived
level of W. The dynamics of the process by
which firms adjust from one level of the
work force to another can, as described by
Okun and by George Perry (1980), generate
modest wage changes in response to the aggregate
shocks. Beyond this, the change in
external pressures for wage adjustment must
be large enough and last long enough to
satisfy the constraints imposed by long-term
implicit contracts on "permanent" wage
changes. Finally, to the extent that these
changes become substantial and widespread,
enough to yield a long-term change in the
perceived level of W, the whole nominal


### ---Economics-1985-0-14.txt---
wage structure around which individual
adjustments occur will be changed.
There are several points to note about this
process. The major gains, in terms of higher
employment, that came from lowering wages
in the face of downward aggregate demand
shocks do not accrue to particular workers in
particular firms as the result of their own
actions. Rather, the gains accrue through the
effect of generalized lower wages in reducing
prices, raising real money balances and
thereby increasing aggregate demand. Once
the assumption of flexible auction markets
and a competitive bidding down of wages by
individual workers is abandoned, it is no
longer valid to level against sticky-wage theories
the charge that they imply an irrational
failure on the part of economic agents to
pursue unexploited gains from trade. Without
the Walrasian auctioneer, the individual firms
in an economy are, as noted earlier, in a
prisoner's dilemma. The large comparative
statics gain from an aggregate nominal wage
cut does not translate into such a gain seen
from the point of view of individual firms.'0
The potential gain they see is the one that
would accrue from making a relative change.
They will indeed make such changes, but
slowly and cautiously, acting under the constraints
on relative changes spelled out
earlier.11 Only as the perceived long-term
level of W falls will the situation be different.


Since what is important for nominal wage
adjustment is the perceived level of W, expectations
about its future value will, of
course, be relevant. Within the constraints
imposed by implicit contracts, wages in individual
firms have to be adjusted to deal with
changing conditions. Since wage changes are
difficult and impose strains on long-term relationships,
the wage once set has to last for
a while, typically at least a year (and under
union contracts often longer). The expectations
that workers and employers have about
the future course of average wages and prices
will therefore exert an important influence
over the current wage decision. I do not want
here to join the controversy over the extent
to which wage setting is backward or forward
looking. But what is central to my
message is that the relevant forecast does not
assume prompt adjustment to a new equilibrium
wage but rather the more hesitant
and gradual process described above.
The appropriate framework for analyzing
the aggregate behavior of wages, therefore, is
not one in which certain macroeconomic imperfections-
information gaps or misperceptions
about the general wage and price level
-prevent the market-clearing adjustment of
wages, which themselves are perfectly flexible
in the face of relative disturbances. The
essence of the behavior of wages in response
to aggregate demand shocks is just the opposite.
Macroeconomic shocks break through
the short-run stickiness of wages and prices
in the face of relative disturbances to produce
the aggregate adjustments, albeit slow
and gradual ones, that we do in fact observe.
There is a nice paradox in all of this. A
prompt adjustment of nominal wages to aggregate
demand shocks, leaving relative
wages unchanged, can be produced only by a
system of highly flexible relative wages. Conversely,
the existence of sticky relative wages
yields long transitional periods in which firms
are adjusting individually to nominal shocks,
and produces, as a side effect, changes in
relative wage and prices.

IV. Final Reflections

The large costs which accompany disinflation
arise from the fact that society has to
0l1n his 1977 article, Robert Barro decouples the
nominal wage and employment responses to perceived
nominal shocks. He argues that even if nominal wages
are sticky, optimal contracts would call for the maintenance
of employment. Firms would vary prices to achieve
this result despite the stickiness of nominal wages.
Otherwise, says Barro, the parties would be ignoring the
unexploited gains from trade, an irrational act. This
paper is not principally concerned with price behavior.
But it is clear that the same externality argument, set
forth above with respect to wages, holds for prices.
Without auction markets or some surrogate for the
Walrasian auctioneer, the external nature of the gains
from price changes would tend to negate the force of the
Barro argument.

1 Since the macroeconomic effects of their own wage
and price decisions do not enter into economic agents'
objective functions, the Akerlof-Yellen conclusions
about the small size of losses from "near-rational"
behavior would apply to the nonauction markets I am
here describing.


### ---Economics-1985-0-15.txt---
send out the same kind of initial signalschanges
in the volume of sales-when it
wants a reallocation of resources as it does
when it wants a change in the general level of
wages and prices. In the first situation, given
the substantial efficiencies which flow from
long-term associations of suppliers with
customers and firms with workers, very cautious
and sluggish changes in wages and
prices are the optimal response to signals. A
large part of the adjustment is optimally
taken up as temporary variations in slack
adjustments in hours, layoffs and rehires,
inventory building and depletion, and rationing
of various kinds. Indeed, a large part of
economic life is dominated by the social
conventions, institutions, and patterns of behavior
that have evolved to avoid the chaos
and inefficiencies that would result from continuous
market clearing.

The signals which firms initially receive
when aggregate demand shocks occur are the
same as those for a resource transfer, but an
exactly opposite response is wanted-large
changes in wages and prices and small
changes in quantities or slack. Since the bulk
of the disturbances to which individual firms
and workers must adjust are relative or local
in nature, and since over long periods of
time micro efficiency tends to outweigh aggregate
resource utilization as a source of
economic welfare, wage- and price-setting
institutions have developed with a bias toward
the sluggish response called for by considerations
of micro efficiency. The cyclical
behavior of the aggregate wage and price
levels unfolds from the gradual overcoming
of that bias.

In the long run, those features of economic
relationships which make short-run price and
wage stickiness optimal and which rationally
prevent continuous market clearing disappear.
Specific assets are converted to capital.
Attrition and learning change the mix of
skills. Random changes get smaller compared
to systematic changes. The private returns
from specific customer-supplier and
worker-firm attachment shrink relative to the
returns from making appropriate adjustments
to changes in tastes, technology, and
other external developments. The rationally
based barriers to market clearing crumble.
We economists are indeed correct to insist on
the long-run efficacy of markets and the utility
of the market clearing paradigm as a way
of explaining long-term market allocations.
But we need not abandon the premise of the
rational maximizing calculus in order to explain
the structural stickiness of wages and
prices and the failure of markets to clear in
the short run. Both phenomena-long-run
market clearing and short-run stickinessultimately
derive from the same rational

aspects of human behavior.

Some of the consequences of this recognition
are nevertheless very troubling for
economic theory and theoretically informed
empirical research. In the new classical economics,
there is no need for empirical research
to determine how wages and prices
respond to demand shocks, given expectations
about the general price level. Pure
theory-the auction-market model-dictates
how prices and wages behave. Empirical research
is needed principally to tell us something
about the formation of expectations on
the general price level.

While contract theory and related research
has been developing rationally based foundations
for structural wage and price stickiness,
the work to date is essentially in the form of
existence theorems. That is, it tells us why
sticky wages are consistent with the rational
calculus. But it does not give us a theoretical
basis for specifying the two basic components
of macro wage adjustment: What
"laws" do firms follow, under implicit contracts,
in adjusting their wages, assuming the
stability of W, the wage norm? And what
does it take to produce a perceived "permanent"
change in that norm?

A full and complete microeconomic foundation
to wage adjustment with the power of
the auction-market model may never be
forthcoming. If that is so, we may have to
look to regularities derived from macroeconomic
empirical research to infer microeconomic
behavior. But this raises another set of
problems. While forward-looking expectations
play much less of a role in the macro
wage adjustment process I have outlined,
they are not completely absent in forming
perceptions about the wage norm. Hence the
force of the Lucas critique, though weakened,

does not disappear. The new classical economics
simply assumes that structural behavior
is market clearing, and hence claims to be
able to identify the expectational effects of a
particular policy regime. In the absence of
such an a priori assumption, however, how
does one go about separately identifying the
expectational from the structural elements in
wage formation? I do not have the answer.
Conceivably, economics, like physics, is subject
to a fundamental indeterminacy theorem.

When the word of my prospective elevation
to this exalted position first circulated at
MIT at the end of March 1983, I happened
to encounter Peter Temin in the library. He
offered congratulations, and added: "In your
presidential address, skip the methodology.
Tell them a story." This is the technique that
he and Paul David used to great effect in
the session on economic history at Dallas a
year ago. I choose, however, to follow the
lead of another economic historian, Donald
McCloskey, who maintains that economics
should be a conversation (1983).
In a recent paper, unpublished I believe,
George Stigler discussed " the imperialism of
economics," which, he claims, is invading
and colonizing political science-through
public choice theory and the economic theory
of democracy-law, and perhaps especially
sociology, where our soon-to-be president-
elect, Gary Becker (1981), has extended
the reach of economics into questions of the
family, marriage, procreation, crime, and
other subjects usually dealt with by the sociologist.
"Imperialism" suggests super- and
subordination, with economics on top, and
raises the question whether as a profession
we are not flirting with vainglory.
My interest has long been in trade, and I
observe that economics imports from, as well
as exports to, its sister social sciences. In
public choice, we can perhaps explain after
the event whose interest was served by a
particular decision, but we need political science
to be able to forecast which interest is
likely to be served, whether that of the executive,
the legislature, the bureaucracy, some
pressure group-and which pressure group
or, in the odd instance, the voters. Individuals
act in their own interest, let us grant,
but a more general motive of emulation may
be drawn from sociology as Adam Smith was
aware in the Wealth of Nations (1776, p.
717), as well as in The Theory of Moral
Sentiments (1759 (1808), I, p. 113). I want
today to borrow one or two ideas from political
philosophy, and to conduct a conversation
with a new, impressive, and growing
breed of political scientists working on international
economic questions. The discussion
falls into two loosely connected halves- the
first dealing with what economists can, perhaps
should, and to some extent do, import
from political philosophy and sociology; the
second dealing more especially with international
public goods.

That sharp and sometimes angry theorist,
Frank Graham (1948), thought it a mistake
to think of trade between nations. Trade
took place between firms, he insisted. The
fact that they were in different states was
irrelevant so long as economic policy was
appropriately minimal, consisting perhaps of
free trade, annually balanced budgets, and
the gold standard. But states may differentiate
between firms, through such measures as
tariffs, embargos, monetary, fiscal, and exchange
rate policy which affect all firms
within a given space, and this adds a political
dimension (see my 1978 study). The essence
may go deeper. In an early graduate quiz,
I asked for the difference between domestic
and international trade, expecting a Ricardian
answer on factor mobility. One paper,
however, held that domestic trade was
among " us," whereas international trade was
between "us" and "them." The student who


### ---Economics-1986-0-04.txt---
wrote this (now escaped from economics and
teaching international law at a leading university)
had come from Cambridge University
and a course with Harry Johnson. We
go beyond this simple statement today in
saying that nations are groups of people with
common tastes in public goods (Richard
Cooper, 1977). Geography discriminates between
countries, as a hypothetical customs
union between Iceland and New Zealand
would demonstrate, and so do governments.
Behind and alongside of governments, people
discriminate.

Public goods, let me remind you, are that
class of goods like public works where exclusion
of consumers may be impossible, but in
any event consumption of the good by one
consuming unit-short of some level approaching
congestion-does not exhaust its
availability for others. They are typically
underproduced-not, I believe, for the Galbraithian
reason that private goods are advertized
and public goods are not-but because
the consumer who has access to the
good anyhow has little reason to vote the
taxes, or pay his or her appropriate share.
Unless the consumer is a highly moral person,
following the Kantian Categorical Imperative
of acting in ways which can be
generalized, he or she is apt to be a "free
rider." The tendency for public goods to be
underproduced is serious enough within a
nation bound by some sort of social contract,
and directed in public matters by a
government with the power to impose and
collect taxes. It is, I propose to argue in due
course, a more serious problem in international
political and economic relations in the
absence of international government.
Adam Smith's list of public goods was
limited to national defense, law and order,
and public works that it would not pay individuals
to produce for themselves. Most
economists are prepared now to extend the
list to include stabilization, regulation, and
income redistribution (Cooper, 1977), even
nationalism (Albert Breton, 1964), and standards
that reduce transaction costs, including
weights and measures, language, and
money. Public goods were popular a decade
ago. There is something of a tendency today,
at least in political science, to draw back and
claim that such institutions as open world
markets are not public goods because countries
can be excluded from them by discrimination.
One monetarist goes so far as to
maintain that money is not a public good,
arguing, I believe, from the store-of-value
function where possession by one individual
denies possession by others, rather than from
the unit-of-account function in which exclusion
is impossible and exhaustion does not
hold (Roland Vaubel, 1984).

II

Before addressing international public
goods, I want to digress to suggest that there
are other limits to the imperialist claims of
economics. Social goods are not traded in
markets, for example-honor, respect, dignity,
love. In his address to the Columbia
University Bicentennial Assembly, Sir Dennis
Robertson asserted that what economists
economize is love (1955, pp. 5-6). Michael
Walzer (1983, pp. 101-02) has compiled a
list of " things" that contemporary moral
philosophy will not tolerate being bought
and sold: human beings, political power,
criminal justice, freedom of expression, marriage
and procreation rights (pace Becker),
the right to leave the political community,
exemptions from military service and jury
duty, political office, basic services like police
protection, desperate exchanges such as
permission for women and children to
work fourteen hours a day, prizes and honors,
love and friendship, criminally noxious substances
such as heroin. The inclusion of a
number of items on the list is debatable, and
history reveals that most of them have been
traded on occasion in some cultures. The
market, moreover, strikes two lawyers as a
dubious device for making "tragic choices,"
like those in which scarcity confronts humanistic
moral values, for example, allocating
food in famine, children available for adoption,
or organ transplants (Guido Calabrese
and Philip Bobbit, 1978). It is difficult to
dissent from Walzers's conclusion that a
radically laissez-faire economy would be like
a totalitarian state, treating every social good
as if it were a commodity (1983, p. 119).
There is, moreover, a similar remark from a


### ---Economics-1986-0-05.txt---
founder of the Chicago school, Frank Knight,
who said that the extreme economic man,
maximizing every material interest, and the
extreme Christian, loving his neighbor as
himself, were alike in that neither had any
friends.'

To admit social goods, not traded in
markets, into our economic calculus does not
call for altruism. Economists are reluctant to
depend on self-denial to any degree (Kenneth
Arrow, 1975, p. 22), and moral philosophers
are not far behind. To a modern
student of ethics, James Fishkin (1982, ch.
ii), obligations to others fall into three categories:
minimal altruism, where the benefit
to the receiver is substantial and the cost
to the altruist low-the acts of a cheap
Samaritan; acts of heroic sacrifice that are
not called for; and a robust zone of indifference
where one has no cause to be concerned
over the effects of one's acts on others.
This is for positive actions. Acts that harm
others are proscribed by the Golden Rule.
Adam Smith expressed the same viewpoint
forcefully: " Every man is, no doubt, by nature
first and principally recommended to his
own care" (1759 (1808), I, p. 193), but goes
on: "Although the ruin of our neighbour
may affect us less than a very small misfortune
of our own, we must not ruin him to
prevent that small misfortune, or even to
prevent our own ruin" (ibid., p. 194). Does
this prohibit us from playing zero-sum games
or negative non-zero-sum games? In international
trade, must we refrain from levying
the optimum tariff? The optimum tariff works
to self-interest mainly in the absence of retaliation,
and if Adam Smith excludes hurting
our neighbor, he recognizes that "as every
man doth, so shall it be done to him, and
retaliation seems to be the great law of nature"
(ibid., p. 191).

Note parenthetically that today's moral
philosophers cover a wide territory either
side of Fishkin, from Peter Singer (1972) at
one extreme whose criterion of justice requires
successive acts of altruism until the
welfare of the recipient has risen to that of
the giver which has fallen, to Robert Nozick
(1974) at the other who believes that self-interest
rules out altruism almost altogether.
III

Self-interest then is legitimate over a large
zone of indifference provided that justice
is served by our not hurting others. But
the robust zone of indifference applies to
strangers, and not to those with whom we
have a special relationship, sharing collective
goods. It does not apply in the family, the
neighborhood, in clubs, in the tribe, racial or
religious group, or in the nation. There is
some uncertainty whether it applies in regions
within a country-New England, the
West, the South-or to arrangements between
countries short of the world level such
as North America or the European Common
Market. Collective goods involved here are
distributed by mechanisms different from the
market: gifts, grants, unequal exchange,
sharing through a budget according to
need, interest-free loans, inheritance, dowries,
alimony, and the like all have a place.
Membership in these groups is decided in
various ways: by birth, by choice-as in
moving into a certain neighborhood or
migrating between countries, by application
for admission and acceptance. Walzer defends
the right of countries to keep out
would-be immigrants motivated by economic
self-interest, but not those subjected to
persecution: "The primary good that we
distribute to one another is membership in
some community" (1981; 1983, ch. ii, p. 1).
He argues, however, that states lack the right
to keep members from emigrating if there is
some other community ready to take them
in. Clubs discriminate against outsiders.
Neighborhoods are more complex, being presumably
open to anyone able to afford and
find a place to live, but, in sociological reality,
often exhibiting tendencies to attract their
own kind and repel others, including harassment
or unwritten or even legal restrictions
against property ownership. The groupings
are amorphous, but they exist.
The nature of the positive bonds that link
families, neighborhoods, tribes, regions, and


### ---Economics-1986-0-06.txt---
nations is usually taken for granted and left
unexplored, but the consequences are not.
Albert Hirschman (1970), for example, makes
a distinction between voice and exit: voice
-speaking up and trying to persuade-being
the appropriate action when one disagrees
with the course followed by a group to which
one belongs; and exit-resigning or refusal
to buy the good or service-as a response to
what one dislikes in the market. Adam Smith
minimizes the difference between families and
strangers, suggesting that affection is little
more than habitual sympathy produced by
propinquity; despite the greater thickness of
blood than water, he claims that siblings
educated at distances from one another experience
a diminution of affection (1759 (1808)
II, pp. 68-70). In arguing against Walzer's
view that countries owe immigrants the right
to become citizens, Judith Lichtenberg (1981)
echoes Smith's view in saying that the crucial
difference between members and strangers
lies between those with whom one has faceto-
face contact and those with whom one
does not. An accident that kills someone in
one's town or a neighboring community is
likely to be more moving than a catastrophe
at the other end of the world in which
hundreds or thousands die. Adam Smith goes
further, comparing the loss of a little finger
with a catastrophe that swallowed up
China: ". . . if he lost his little finger he could
not sleep, but for China he can snore... provided
he has never seen them" (ibid., I, p.
317).

Some years ago in a book on the brain
drain, Harry Johnson (1968) argued in favor
of a cosmopolitan solution, encouraging
emigration, and Don Patinkin (1968) for a
national one. In discussing the Bhagwati
scheme for taxing professional emigrants
earning more abroad than at home, for the
benefit of the poor sending country-saying
this was akin to paying alimony in a divorce
case for breaking a social taboo-I suggested
(1977) that the Johnson position was equivalent
to saying that a person should go where
he or she could earn the highest return, while
Patinkin said that people should stay where
they belonged. Patinkin chided me privately
for this interpretation, and it is admittedly
oversimplified. But the difference between
the Johnson and the Patinkin positions, both
emanating from Chicago, suggests the line
between market and nonmarket areas in economics
is shadowy.

In writing about the multinational corporation,
I have from time to time suggested
that host countries resist the intrusion of
strangers because "...man in his elemental
state is a peasant with a possessive love of
his own turf; a mercantilist who favors exports
over imports; a Populist who distrusts
banks, especially foreign banks; a monopolist
who abhors competition; a xenophobe
who feels threatened by strangers
and foreigners" (1984, p. 39), usually adding
that it is the task of international economics
to extirpate these primitive instincts and to
teach cosmopolitanism. The fact that some
of these reactions remain at a late stage in
the educational process can be tested by the
device of asking students on examinations,
seriatim, a series of questions:
Do you advocate free trade, or at least is
there a strong presumption in its favor?
Do you advocate the free international
movement of portfolio capital?
... of corporate capital in foreign direct
investment?

... free migration of students and professional
labor?

... immigration of relatives of persons
permanently resident in this country?
... free migration for all?

(It is desirable to feed these questions to the
victims one at a time, without revealing the
whole list before the first answer is given,
and to take up the replies to the first questions
so that there is no chance to go back
and amend early answers.) There will be
sophisticated answers expatiating on the second,
third, and fourth-best if the marginal
conditions for a Pareto optimal solution are
not met, and I would particularly excuse a
James Meade (1955) solution that would limit
immigration from countries that have not
accomplished their Malthusian revolution, on
the ground that their emigrants will be replaced,
so that free immigration will reduce
world income per capita, if not world income
as a whole. Most economists and noneconomists
alike would agree, however, that
goods are less intrusive than money, money


### ---Economics-1986-0-07.txt---
less so than corporations with control over
our economic decisions.2 Intellectuals with
whom we identify are hardly intrusive at all.
Most of us grant that relatives must be permitted
to come together. On the other hand,
free migration of labor in general poses a
threat to the national identity. The Swiss cut
off immigration, despite the appeals of business
for more labor, when immigrants constituted
one-third of the labor force. In
Germany, separate localities felt threatened
and stopped inward migration when immigrants
reached 12 percent of the resident
population. Feelings differed, of course, depending
upon the origin of the migrants and
their appearance, language, and religion.
One early venture of international economics
into this line of investigation was
Robert Mundell's "optimum currency area"
(1961), initiating a discussion of how large
the area for a single currency should be, that
can readily be extended to economics in
general and to other social sciences. Mundell
defined an optimum currency area as one
where labor moved freely within the area,
but not between it and other areas, taking us
back to the Ricardian criterion distinguishing
domestic from foreign trade: factor mobility
within but not between countries. In
neither case is the discontinuity in mobility
explained. Perhaps something is owed to low
transport costs, but additionally, factor mobility
requires a group with such strong social
cohesion that those moving are willing to
shift, and those at the receiving end are
content to receive them.

Ronald McKinnon (1963) offered a different
criterion: an optimum currency area was
one that traded intensively at home, but only
to a limited extent abroad. This implied that
tastes within a country are homogeneous for
traded goods (as well as for public goods),
and that regionally specialized production
had grown up to serve those tastes. The
Mundell and McKinnon criteria do not necessarily
converge: on Mundell's standard,
Canada is too big to be an optimum currency
area, because of limited movement between
Quebec and the English-speaking parts
of Canada, and the comparative isolation of
the Maritimes and Vancouver. On McKinnon'
s criterion, however, it was too small
because so much of its trade is with the
United States.

If one broadens the issue from the optimum
currency area to economics more generally
and to the other social sciences,
anomalies arise from the divergence between
the optimum economic area, which on
efficiency grounds I take to be the world, and
the optimum social unit, one that gives the
individual a sense of belonging and counting
-which is much smaller. In shifting to the
optimum political unit, at least two problems
arise, one related to the nature of the ties, the
other to the ambitions of its members. To
take the second point first, for a nation bent
on glory-led by a Bismarck or a de Gaulle
-bigger is better; whereas if one is merely
trying to get along without trouble, like, say,
Denmark, small is beautiful enough.
On the first issue, political ties vary widely.
There are leagues, alliances, commonwealths,
confederations, federations, provinces, states,
principalities, kingdoms. Some lesser units
are "united" in varying degrees, as in the
United Provinces of the Netherlands, the
United States of America, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland.
The North in the American Civil War was a
union, as the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics
asserts it is. The small amount of
literature I have explored in examining the
differences among these forms is not very
conclusive, but perhaps the main distinction
is between a single state that is centralized,
and federations that are loosely joined, with
greater powers at the local level. Designations
are not always congruent with reality:
the Federal German Republic is highly unified,
despite the efforts of the occupation
powers after World War II to spread political


### ---Economics-1986-0-08.txt---
power widely; the Federal Reserve System
was created as a loose agglomeration of
twelve regional money markets but quickly
fused into a single system in World War I.
Centralization and federalization have reflections
in demography and in finance.

City populations in unified states follow a
Pareto-skewed distribution with a single
dominant city like London, Paris, or Vienna,
and no close rival among the tail of smaller
cities and towns. In federations the distribution
of cities is log normal (Brian Berry,
1961). Parallel to the demographic division is
the financial. Paris has 91.3 percent of French
bank clearings; London 87 percent of those
for Britain. The contrast is with Canada:
Toronto, 37.3 percent; Montreal, 25.5 percent;
Vancouver, 6.5 percent. Between these
extremes lies Japan with Tokyo 51.2 percent
and Osaka 19.7 percent (Jean Labasse, 1974,
pp. 144-45).

One explanation for differences between
centralized and federal states is historical:
where larger states were formed later from
unification of lesser units, administrative and
financial functions were already being discharged
at the local level, reducing the need
for centralized services. This hypothesis faces
the difficult counterexamples of Italy and
Germany, unified out of smaller units in the
second half of the nineteenth century, that
quickly centralized administrative and financial
functions, in Rome and Milan for Italy,
and in Berlin for Germany. Another explanation
runs in terms of size, with larger
states necessarily federal because of the difficulty
of providing administration to local
units over long distances. This fits Canada,
Australia, the United States, perhaps India,
but fails to account for Switzerland, unless
size is a proxy for maintaining a dense network
of communication, and division of valleys
by high mountains produces barriers
equivalent to those of continental states. If
the mathematically minded among you need
an analogue, think of federal states as decomposable
matrices.

The difference between a single state and a
federation may be illustrated with two examples.
Some years ago, Seymour Harris (1952)
wrote a book on New England in which he
claimed that the area got a raw deal from the
rest of the country because it paid more in
taxes to the federal government than it received
in federal expenditure. This thesis implicitly
violated the distinction between a
budget and a market: in a market equal
values are exchanged. A budget, on the other
hand, is a device expressing the cohesion of a
sharing group with monies raised according
to one standard, perhaps ability to pay, and
expenditure distributed according to another,
some combination of efficiency and need.
The other example, equally shocking to an
international trade economist, was the notion
of the juste retour, or fair return, propounded
by France in connection with expenditure
for joint projects in Europe. France
insisted that all monies contributed by her be
spent in France. Tied sales are a third- or
fourth-best device to limit balance-of-payments
deficits for a given contribution to
joint efforts, or to maximize the contribution
for a given deficit. They are inefficient rather
than fair.

IV

But I want to move on to the geopolitical
unit that produces public goods. It is a cliche
that these have increased in size as costs of
transport and communication have declined.
Under the eighteenth-century Poor Law in
England, the parish resisted immigration
from neighboring parishes because of reluctance
to share with outsiders. Fernand
Braudel (1982) and Sir John Hicks (1969)
have each expatiated on the rise of the size of
the economic unit from the city-state to the
nation-state. National and international markets
for goods and money grew slowly, with
entrepot centers that intermediated between
buyers and sellers surviving in money- cheap
to move in space-and largely disappearing
for goods where costs of transport were high
and could be saved by direct selling, rather
than relaying goods through fairs in the Middle
Ages and later through cities such
as Amsterdam, Hamburg, Frankfurt, and
London. The hub-and-spoke system recently
discovered in airplane travel and still in place
for money has long been superceded in goods.
Caroline Isard and Walter Isard's (1945)
point that the most pervasive changes in the


### ---Economics-1986-0-09.txt---
economy came from innovations in transport
and communications remains valid: contemplate
the rudder (in place of the steering
oar), fore-and-aft sails; the turnpike; canal;
railroad (despite Robert Fogel, 1964); the
steamship; iron-clad ship; telegraph; telephone;
refrigerator ship; radio; airplane;
bulk carrier; jet airplane; satellite television.
The numbers of people brought into faceto-
face contact across continents and hemispheres
has increased exponentially. It is true,
to be sure, as was said about a well-known
governor and presidential candidate, that it
was impossible to dislike him until one got to
know him, and increases in mobility and
communications have been accompanied by
separatism: of the Walloons from the Flemish
in Belgium, of Scotland and Wales in the
United Kingdom (to pass over the troubled
Irish question), and of the Quebecois in
Canada.3 But it is easier than in Adam
Smith's day to imagine ourselves in the circumstances
of the Chinese, the inhabitants of
the Sahelian desert in Africa, or the
tornado-struck islands of Bangladesh as we
see them nightly on our television screens via
satellite. Do wider communication and transport
change the production and distribution
of public goods?

Conflicts between economics and political
science abound, and many arise from the
fact that goods, money, corporations, and
people are mobile, whereas the state is fixed.
The increase in mobility produced by innovations
in transport and communication
during and after World War II led some of
us to conclude that the nation-state was in
difficulty. A reaction occurred in the 1970's.
It is significant that Raymond Vernon's influential
book Sovereignty at Bay (1971),
showing the multinational corporation ascendant
over the state, was followed by his
Storm over Multinationals (1977) in which
the position is reversed. Cooper's The Economics
of Interdependence (1968) was followed
by an upsurge of interest in national
autonomy, decoupling, and pluralism among
political scientists, most of whom approve
the nation-state and have as heroes, if they
will forgive me, not Adam Smith and
Woodrow Wilson, but Otto von Bismarck
and perhaps even Charles de Gaulle. The
tension remains, however. Mobility limits the
state's capacity to enforce its writ in taxation,
in foreign policy, in standards on such
matters as antitrust, pure food and drugs,
insider trading in securities, and the like.
Mobility undermines social cohesion through
the easy intrusion of different nationalities,
races, religions, and traditions into the body
politic.

V

I come at long last to international public
goods. The primary one is peace. Economists
are poorly qualified to discuss how, after
war, peace is restored and maintained. Most
of us reject the Marxian view that war grows
directly out of capitalism, and as ordinary
citizens and amateur students of history are
prepared to agree that peace may be provided
by a dominant world power- Pax
Romana or Pax Britannica-or by balanceof-
power maneuvering, although that seems
accident prone. Among the more audacious
economists producing an economic theory or
set of theories on war is Walt Rostow (1960,
pp. 108 ff.). There are views that ascribe war
to population pressure, to ambitious rulers
aggressively seeking power, and to complex
miscalculation. How these are to be avoided
or contained is a question primarily for political
science.

In the economic sphere, various international
public goods have been identified: an
open trading system, including freedom of
the seas, well-defined property rights, standards
of weights and measures that may
include international money, or fixed exchange


### ---Economics-1986-0-10.txt---
rates, and the like. Those that have
interested me especially in a study of the
1929 depression and other financial and economic
crises have been trading systems, international
money, capital flows, consistent
macroeconomic policies in periods of tranquility,
and a source of crisis management
when needed. By the last I mean the maintenance
of open markets in glut and a source
of supplies in acute shortage, plus a lender of
last resort in acute financial crisis (see my
1973 book, revised 1986, forthcoming).
Public goods are produced domestically by
government, unless the governmental agenda
is blocked in stalemate among competing
distributional coalitions as described by
Mancur Olson (1982). Voluntary provision
of public goods is plagued by the free rider.
In the international sphere where there is no
world government, the question remains how
public goods are produced. Ralph Bryant is
one of the few economists who has discussed
the public good element in international cooperation.
His vocabulary is different from
that of the political scientists: their "regimes"
are his "supranational traffic regulations"
(1980, p. 470), and he expects leadership in
cooperation in monetary and fiscal policy
from supranational institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund (p. 481). I find
this doubtful on the basis of the interwar
record of such institutions as the League of
Nations.

Political science in this field has produced
two schools: the realists who hold to a national-
interest theory of international politics,
and the moralists, whom Robert Keohane
prefers to call "institutionalists" (1984, p. 7).
Realists maintain that international public
goods are produced, if at all, by the leading
power, a so-called " hegemon," that is willing
to bear an undue part of the short-run costs
of these goods, either because it regards itself
as gaining in the long run, because it is paid
in a different coin such as prestige, glory,
immortality, or some combination of the two.
Institutionalists recognize that hegemonic
leaders emerge from time to time in the
world economy and typically set in motion
habits of international cooperation, called
"regimes," which consist of "principles,
norms, rules and decision-making procedures
around which the expectations of international
actors converge in given issue areas"
(Stephen Krasner, 1983, p. 1). Under British
hegemony, the regimes of free trade and the
gold standard developed more or less unconsciously.
With subsequent American

hegemony, a more purposeful process of institution
making was undertaken, with agreements
at Bretton Woods, on tariffs and trade,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, and the like. Political scientists
recognize that regimes are more readily
maintained than established since marginal
costs are below average costs; as hegemonic
periods come to an end with the waning of
the leading country's economic vitality, new
regimes needed to meet new problems are
difficult to create. Cooper (1985) has written
of the eighty years it took to create and get
functioning the World Health Organization
despite the clear benefits to all countries
from controlling the spread of disease. And
it takes work to maintain regimes; in the
absence of infusions of attention and money,
they tend in the long run to decay.
I originally suggested that the 1929 depression
was allowed to run unchecked because
there was no leading country able and willing
to take responsibility for crisis management,
halting beggar-thy-neighbor policies
from 1930, and especially acting as a lender
of last resort to prevent the serious run on
the Creditanstalt in May 1931 spreading, as
it did, to Germany, Britain, Japan, the United
States, and ultimately to the gold bloc. Britain,
the leading economic power of the nineteenth
century, was unable to halt the run;
the United States, which might have had the
ability, possibly assisted by France, was unwilling.
This view has been rejected by one
economic historian who holds that the troubles
of the interwar period were more
deep-seated, and that what was needed was
more fundamental therapy than maintaining
open markets and providing a lender of last
resort, something, that is, akin to the heroic
public good after World War II, the Marshall
Plan (D. E. Moggridge, 1982). That may
have been true, though there is no way I see
that the issue can be settled. Leadership at
an earlier stage in the 1920's, presumably
furnished by the United States with some


### ---Economics-1986-0-11.txt---
cost in foregone receipts on war-debt account,
might have resolved the war-debt-reparations-
commercial-debt tangle that proved so
destabilizing after the 1929 stock market
crash. I conclude that the existence of an
international lender of last resort made the
financial crises of 1825, 1836, 1847, 1866,
and 1907 more or less ephemeral, like summer
storms, whereas its absence in 1873, 1890,
and 1929 produced deep depressions-shortened
in the 1890 case by the deus ex machina
of gold production from the Rand. Again
there is room for disagreement.
The point of all this is that after about
1971, the United States, like Britain from
about 1890, has shrunk in economic might
relative to the world as a whole, and more
importantly, has lost the appetite for providing
international economic public goodsopen
markets in times of glut, supplies in
times of acute shortage, steady flows of
capital to developing countries, international
money, coordination of macroeconomic policy
and last-resort lending. The contraction
of concern from the world to the nation is
general, and applies to economists as well
as to politicians and the public. In reading
recent books on macroeconomic policy by
leading governmental economists under both
Democratic and Republican administrations,
the late Arthur Okun (1981) and Herbert
Stein (1984), I have been struck by how little
attention the authors paid to international
repercussions. The same observation has been
made by Ralph Bryant (1980, p. xviii) and
by the British economist R. C. 0. Matthews,
reviewing Arjo Klamer's Conversations with
Economists... (1985, p. 621). There has been
a recent upsurge of interest in the international
dimension because of the connections
among the federal deficit, the exchange rate
for the dollar, and the balance-of-payments
deficit, but the focus of this interest is almost
exclusively on what the connections mean
for U.S. interest rates, industrial policy,
growth, and wealth. The international impact
is largely ignored, bearing out the truth
in former German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt's statement that "the United States
seems completely unconscious of the economic
efforts of its policies on the Alliance"
(1984, p. 27).

Some of the discussion of international
regimes by political scientists verges on what
my teacher, Wesley Clair Mitchell, used to
call "implicit theorizing," that is, convenient
ad hoc theoretical explanations to fit given
facts that lack generality. Charles Lipson
(1985), for example, suggested that the slippage
in U.S. hegemony in the 1970's resulted
in a loss of the international public good of
secure property rights and therefore in the
widespread nationalization of foreign direct
investment. He went on to say that the reason
less developed countries (LDCs) did not
default on their debts to bank syndicates was
that bank lending was "better institutionalized,
" "a smaller group," "better protected
by legal remedies" (pp. 136, 158, 170). He
was surprised that the decline of British
hegemony in the interwar period did not
result in more LDC aggression against foreign
property (p. 191), but failed to observe
the widespread default on foreign bonds in
the 1930's, despite the organization of international
finance. In my judgement Keohane
exaggerates the efficacy and importance of
the international regime in oil that was
formed after the first OPEC oil shock of
1973 (see his ch. 10). The crisis caused by the
Yom Kippur embargo of the Netherlands
was to my mind shockingly mishandled by
governments, and the public good of crisis
management was left to the private multinational
oil companies. The formation of the
International Energy Agency was a classic
operation in locking the barn door after the
horse had been stolen.

Between national self-interest and the provision
of international public goods, there is
an intermediate position: indifference to
both. An interesting contrast has been observed
in the 1930's between Britain which
forced Argentina into a bilateral payments
agreement (the Roca-Runciman Agreement
of 1933) in order to take advantage of its
monopsony position, and the United States
that had a similar opportunity vis-a-vis Brazil
but ignored it (Marcelo de Paiva Abreu,
1984).

It is fairly clear from the historical record
that economic hegemony runs down in decay
-in the British case after 1913 and the
United States about 1971-leading Felix


### ---Economics-1986-0-12.txt---
Rohatyn (1984) to say that the American
century lasted only twenty years. The Nixon
shock of 1973 in cutting off soya bean exports
to Japan-a significant harm to an ally
for a small gain to this country-was the act
of a bad Samaritan. The import surcharge of
the same year may have been required to
move the dollar out from the position of the
nth currency when only n -1 countries are
free to fix their exchange rates, but it would
have been possible to start with the later
attempt at cooperation that resulted in the
Smithsonian agreement. This is especially
true when so much of the case against the
1971 exchange rate was the result of the
easy-money policy of the Federal Reserve
System under Chairman Arthur Burns, at a
time when the Bundesbank was tightening its
money market/go-it-alone policies of both
banks that flooded the world with dollars.
The present U.S. administration claims to
be working for open trade and does fairly
well in resisting appeals for protection. The
positive push for a Reagan round of trade
liberalization in services and agriculture,
however, is in pursuit of a national and not
an international public good. The regime in
capital movements-the World Bank, the regional
development banks and that in-lastresort
lending orchestrated by the IMFseems
to be working, with bridging loans and
an ad hoc purchase of oil from Mexico for
the U.S. stockpile in 1982 when the IMF
finds itself unable to move fast enough. But
there are signs of dissension that may spell
trouble. The June 1985 bridging loan for
Argentina was declined by Germany and
Switzerland on the grounds that Argentina
had not been sufficiently austere and that its
problems were not a threat to the world
financial system (New York Times, June 15,
1985, p. 1). The Japanese contribution,
moreover, was said to have been small, although
no figures were given.

What I worry about mostly is exchange
policy and macroeconomic coordination. The
U.S. Treasury under Donald Regan was
committed to the policy of neglect, presumably
benign, but in any event ideological.
And the commitment to consultative macroeconomic
policies in annual summit meetings
of seven heads of state has become a shadow
play, a dog-and-pony show, a series of photo
opportunities-whatever you choose to call
them-with ceremony substituted for substance.
The 1950's and 1960's, when serious
discussions were held at the lowly level of
Working Party No. 3 of the O.E.C.D., were
superior because the United States and other
countries took them seriously.
I am a realist when it comes to regimes. It
seems to me that the momentum set in motion
by a hegemonic power-if we must use
that expression, I prefer to think of leadership
or responsibility-runs down pretty
quickly unless it is sustained by powerful
commitment. The IMF and World Bank were
agreed at Bretton Woods largely as a result
of the U.S. Treasury: the forms were international,
the substance was dictated by a single
country (Armand van Dormel, 1978). In the
early days of the IMF, Frank Southard told
me, if the United States made no proposal,
nothing happened. Today the same is true of
the European Economic Community: unless
Germany and France see eye to eye, which is
infrequent, nothing happens. Proposals of
great technical appeal from individuals or
small countries are not welcomed as the preparatory
phases of the World Economic

Conference of 1933 demonstrated (see my
1973 book, pp. 210-14). There needs to be
positive leadership, backed by resources and
a readiness to make some sacrifice in the
international interest.

The leadership role is not applauded. When
the United States accused the rest of the
world of being free riders, Andrew Shonfield
countercharged the United States of being a
" hard rider," " hustling and bullying the
Europeans," "kicking over chairs when it did
not get its way" (1976, pp. 86, 88, 102).
Furnishing the dollar to the world as international
money has brought the United States
an accusation of extracting seignorage, although
the facts that the dollar is not a
monopoly currency and that foreign holdings
earn market rates of interest deflect that
criticism in sophisticated quarters.
Neglect can verge on sabotage. When the
European central banks collaborated to hold
the dollar down at the end of February 1985,
the conspicuous failure of the United States

Bank of New York has expressed concern
that the habits of central bank cooperation
and U.S. official intimacy with the workings
of the foreign-exchange market that have
been built up over thirty years are being
squandered for ideological reasons (Scott
Pardee, 1964, p. 2).

Regimes are clearly more attractive in
political terms than hegemony, or even than
leadership with its overtones of the German
Fuhrerprinzip or of Italy's II Duce, if not
necessarily more so than responsibility. Polycentralism,
pluralism, cooperation, equality,
partnership, decoupling, self-reliance, and
autonomy all have resonance. But it is hard
to accept the view, so appealing to the political
right, that the path to achieve cooperation
is a tit-for-tat strategy, applied in a
repetitive game, that teaches the other player
or players to cooperate (Robert Axelrod,
1984). As Tibor Scitovsky demonstrated years
ago (1937), this path can readily end by
wiping out trade altogether. Hierarchical
arrangements are being examined by economic
theorists studying the organization of
firms, but for less cosmic purposes than
would be served by political and economic
organization of the production of international
public goods (Raj Sah and Joseph
Stiglitz, 1985).

Minding one's own business-operating in
the robust zone of indifference-is a sound
rule on trend when macroeconomic variables
are more or less stable. To the economist it
means reliance on the market to the extent
that the conditions for a Pareto optimum
solution are broadly met. But the fallacy of
composition remains a threat, and one cannot
count on the Categorical Imperative.
Markets work most of the time, as a positivesum
game in which the gain for one does not
imply a loss for another. Experience teaches,
however, that crises may arise. When they
do, the rule changes from government and
public indifference to the production of public
goods by leadership or by a standby
regime.

Leadership or responsibility limited to
crises encounters another problem: how to
keep the machinery for handling crises from
obsolescence. In crisis one needs forceful and
intelligent people, capable of making decisions
with speed under pressure. It is
sometimes said that the Japanese practice of
decision by consensus with ideas coming up
from below, makes it hard for that country
to discharge in timely fashion the responsibilities
of world leadership. In Marcus
Goodrich's Delilah (1941), the amiable practice
of fraternization between a watch officer
and enlisted men on the bridge of the destroyer
proved dangerous in a typhoon since
the men had fallen into the habit of discussing
the officer's orders. The paradox is that
the attributes needed in crisis tend to atrophy
in quiet times; for example in the control
room of a Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant.

Let me conclude by emphasizing once
again my concern that politicians, economists,
and political scientists may come to
believe that the system should be run at
all times by rules, including regimes, not people.
Rules are desirable on trend. In crisis
the need is for decision. I quote once more
the letter of Sir Robert Peel of June 1844
a propos of the Bank Charter Act of that
year:

My Confidence is unshaken that we
have taken all the Precautions which
Legislation can prudently take against
the Recurrence of a pecuniary Crisis. It
may occur in spite of our Precautions;
and if it be necessary to assume a grave
Responsibility, I dare say Men will be
found willing to assume such a Responsibility.

 ## Economics-1987-0


### ---Economics-1987-0-01.txt---
I want to use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for pontificating to the profession,
to explore ways of improving the interaction
between what economists do and the political
process. Tension and conflict are, of
course, inherent in political decisions, especially
on economic policy. Nothing can make
such decisions easy. Nevertheless, it is my
contention that economic policymaking in
Washington in the last decade has been more
frustrating, muddled, and confusing than
necessary. Some of the fault lies with
economists and economics; some with politicians
and the political process; some in the
interactions. I want to offer some suggestions
for modest improvements.

Most economists probably share my premise
that economics ultimately ought to be
more than just challenging intellectual gymnastics.
It ought to help us understand how
the economy works and provide a basis for
intelligent political choices among economic
policies. Even those who devote their energies
to resolving purely theoretical issues
imagine that somehow in the end their efforts
will prove socially useful.

The dedicated, idealistic young economist
who aspires to advise a government may well
envision herself someday as the wise and
impartial adviser to the philosopher queen.
In this daydream, the adviser presents the
best forecasts that can be made of the future
course of the economy. She explains the
macroeconomic policy options and what is
likely to happen if each is undertaken. She
elucidates why market solutions are efficient,
when markets are likely to fail, and what can
be done when this occurs. She identifies risks
and uncertainties, which fortunately are not
overwhelming. She represents the best professional
judgment of her fellow economists,
indicating the major respects in which most
economists agree and scrupulously pointing
out that in minor respects the views of some
of her professional colleagues might differ
from her own. She remains above the political
fray, identifying any values or distributional
biases that may creep into her
judgments and eschewing identification with
interest groups or ideological causes.
The queen for her part listens carefully
and intelligently, asks thoughtful questions,
and weighs the options. She may consult
other experts on noneconomic aspects of the
decisions, but these can be assumed not to
be very important. She then makes final
decisions-even very hard ones-and sticks
to them. The decisions are carried out, the
economy prospers, and a grateful nation applauds
the wisdom of the monarch and her
economist and the usefulness of economics.
But in the real world, both economics and
politics are frustratingly unlike this picture.
Both are pluralistic in the extreme and appear
to be getting more so. Economists and
political leaders not only miscQmmunicate,
but each accuses the other of incompetence,
obfuscation, self-serving motives, and antisocial
behavior.

Economists, of course, do not wait for
others to attack them; they do it themselves.
Walter Heller said in his presidential address
that the "chorus of self criticism has risen to
a new crescendo" (1975, p. 1), and the selfdeprecation
has not abated in the intervening
decade. If a golden age of economists'
self-confidence ever occurred, it is long past.
Events of recent years have kept reminding
us that our national economy is diverse and
complex, battered by unpredictable shocks,
and increasingly interconnected with the even


### ---Economics-1987-0-02.txt---
more diverse and complex world outside our
borders. Knowledge of how the domestic
economy works and interacts with the rest of
the world is imperfect. Economists keep
coming up with ingeneous theories, but they
have a hard time testing them. Data are
inadequate and controlled experimentation
nearly impossible. Modeling has greatly
enhanced our understanding of the past,
but shows few visible signs of improving
the reliability of macroeconomic prediction.
Forecasting even for short periods remains
an uncertain art in which neither economists
nor politicians can have much confidence.
Many of the most sophisticated and realistic
members of the profession, conscious of
all these difficulties, have abandoned the attempt
to advise governments on policies
in favor of the more manageable tasks of
adding to the knowledge base. This may be
understandable, but it deprives the economic
policy debate of the input of some very good
minds and runs the risk of leaving the job of
interacting with the political arena disproportionately
to those with strong ideological
views.

I. Fragmentation of the Economic Policy Process
The pluralism of economics pales beside
the pluralism of the political system that
policy-minded economists aspire to assist.
Even if one leaves aside the complexities of
federalism, the process by which national
economic policy evolves in Washington is so
fragmented and complicated that it is almost
impossible to explain to the uninitiated how
it is supposed to work, let along how it does
work.

A well-founded distrust of despots led our
forefathers not only to opt for representative
democracy, but to divide power among
the executive and legislative and judicial
branches, and between the House and the
Senate. On matters of taxing and spending,
they were especially protective of the power
of the people's representatives, making it
clear that while the president could propose
taxing and spending, the ultimate authority
lies with the Congress, subject only to presidential
veto. This divided power creates a
built-in hurdle to making and carrying out
fiscal policy. The hurdle is low when the
president is articulating a policy that has
broad support in the country and in the
Congress. It can lead to erratic shifts of
policy when the president is indecisive, and
to deadlock when the president is leading
in a direction in which the public and its
elected representatives do not wish to go.
Deadlocks are rare, but can be serious. The
failure to reduce the huge structural budget
deficit of the mid-1980's largely reflects the
fact that the president's solution-drastic
reduction of the federal role in the domestic
economy-does not command broad popular
support.

The separation of powers between the
Congress and the president is basic to our
system of government and probably worth
the price of occasional deadlock. The difficulties
of making economic policy, however,
are strongly compounded by the propensity
of our pluralistic society to diffuse
power and decision-making authority both
within the executive branch and within Congress.
With respect to taxing and spending
policy, for example, the simple notion that
the president proposes and the Congress disposes
is greatly complicated by the fragmentation
of power within each branch. Moreover,
periodic efforts to make the policy
process more coherent within each branch,
while often temporarily successful, have
added new power centers without consolidating
the old ones.

In the executive branch, the trend since
early in the century has been to centralize
power in the White House in order to make
it easier for the president to formulate and
articulate taxing and spending policy, and to
utilize the growing skills of the economics
profession to that end. But this worthy goal
has been accomplished in stages, with a new
institution added at each stage. The creation
of what is now called the Office of Management
of Budget (OMB) in the 1920's made it
possible for the president to review and
evaluate spending requests and impose a set
of priorities on his budget proposal to Congress
reflecting his administration's view of
the appropriate size and role of government.
The creation of the Council of Economic
Advisers (CEA) in the 1940's provided a


### ---Economics-1987-0-03.txt---
focal point for bringing the advice of the
economics profession into the service of
presidential decision making and a locus
for creating an official forecast of economic
activity.

The creation of OMB and CEA improved
the president's ability to formulate and
articulate macroeconomic policy. It also left
the president, in addition to his other impossible
duties, with the job of resolving a builtin
tension over responsibility for economic
policy among the CEA, OMB, and the
Treasury, not to mention the White House
staff and the agencies with line responsibility
for implementing various aspects of economic
poclcy.

Presidents have tried various coordination
mechanisms including "troika" arrangements
and an almost infinite variety of
broader councils and committees with varying
membership, responsibilities, and leadership.
The system works tolerably well or
exceedingly creakily, depending on the president'
s personal style and the personalities
involved. But it encourages battling over turf
as well as substance, and is hardly designed
to minimize the amount of presidential energy
needed to evolve a coherent, explainable
policy on taxing and spending. One
might wonder whether it is not time to do
what so many other countries do and give
our president the equivalent of a responsible
finance minister charged with the functions
now diffused to our budget director, Council
of Economic Advisers, and Treasury Secretary.


The fragmentation of power and responsibility
is, of course, even more extreme in the
Congress. The legislative branch also has a
long history of attempts to make taxing and
spending policy in a more coherent fashion
by adding new coordinating institutionsappropriations
committees, a joint economic

committee, budget committees, a congressional
budget office-without eliminating or
consolidating any of the old ones.
The most recent attempt to improve congressional
economic decision making-one

in which I was an active participant-followed
the Budget Reform Act of 1974 which
created the budget committees and the Congressional
Budget Office. These budget reforms
succeeded in their main objective of
focusing the attention of the Congress on
overall budget policy, not just individual taxing
and spending fragments. They have
forced the Congress to fit the pieces together,
to debate and vote on an overall taxing
and spending plan-a budget resolution-to
which specific taxing and spending matters
must conform. No one can say that the
Congress in the last few years has ignored
fiscal policy! The creation of the Congressional
Budget Office, moreover, has given
Congress independent access to forecasts,
projections, and analysis of economic options.


The downside of the budget reforms, however,
was that the budget process was superimposed
on the already complex responsibilities
of authorizing, appropriating, and tax
committees. It has added to the layers and
stages of congressional policymaking without
removing any of them, has made the process
of budget decision making nearly impossible
even for members of Congress to understand,
and increased the workload so much that
decisions are routinely made late and in an
atmosphere of crisis. Moreover, Congress
now frequently has to deal with two sets of
estimates, those of the OMB and those of
the Congressional Budget Office, which may
differ because they are based on different
forecasts of economic activity, or for even
less obvious technical reasons.
Meanwhile, back in the separate world of
the Federal Reserve, monetary policy is being
decided and carried out. It is a curious
paradox that a nation, which feels it needs
many more hands on the tiller of fiscal policy
than most countries regard as workable, is
content to leave monetary policy to a central
bank with fewer visible ties to the rest of the
government than the central banks of most
countries.

There is plenty of informal communication,
of course, especially between the
Federal Reserve and the hydraheaded economic
establishment of the executive branch.
More formal cooperation between the monetary
and fiscal authorities, as in the United
Kingdom, might contribute only marginally
to making monetary and fiscal policy decisions
part of a more coherent strategy for


### ---Economics-1987-0-04.txt---
the economy-and at the cost of depriving
the executive branch of the luxury of blaming
the Federal Reserve when things go
wrong. The love-hate relation between the
Congress and Federal Reserve, however,
warrants more attention. Despite occasional
outbursts of anxiety over escalating interest
rates, Congress has shown little inclination
to control monetary policy, or even to inquire
into the consistency of monetary and
fiscal objectives. The Fed is required to report
monetary growth targets to the banking
committees, as though monetary policy were
a matter of banking system regulation, but
has little genuine interaction with the budget
committees whose job is to debate and propose
fiscal policy.

II. The Process under Stress

This whole complicated economic policy
system has been subjected to enormous strain
in recent years. Political economists like to
harken back to the golden years of the 1950's
and 1960's when economists got respect and
the economic policy machinery functioned
smoothly. The nostalgia is only partly a result
of faulty memories. It's not hard to
be satisfied with economists and policy
processes when the economy is growing, productivity
marches steadily upward, and even
the national debt is obligingly declining in
relative importance. It's much harder when
productivity growth plummets for reasons
that no one honestly purports fully to understand,
expectations of public and private
consumers have to be cut back to fit with
slower income growth, and inflation and interest
rates are bouncing around at unfamiliar
levels.

Adjusting to the energy shocks and slower
growth that began in the 1970's strained the
economic policy processes of all industrial
countries and made the participants feel
frustrated and inadequate. It's not obvious,
even with hindsight, that the fundamental
difficulties facing the industrial world in the
1970's can credibly be blamed on economists
or any particular structure of government
or economic policy responses, but all came
in for their share of the understandable
hostility.

The difficulties of the U.S. economy in the
1980's, by contrast, revolve heavily around
an economic policy mistake: the creation of
a large structural deficit in the federal budget.
I do not believe that the structure of our
economic decision process was the cause of
the mistake. Blaming the deficit on inherent
flaws in the policy process requires an explanation
of why the process did not cause
similar mistakes in the past. But the events
of 1981 which produced the deficit illustrate
several of the difficulties of economic policymaking
which make mistakes harder to

avoid:

the uncertainty of macroeconomic forecasting;


the isolation of monetary and fiscal
policy;

the contentiousness of economists and
their tendency to let their ideological positions
cloud their judgments about the
likely effects of particular policies.
That a tax cut unmatched by comparable
spending cuts would produce a deficit should
have surprised no economist. That the deficit
was so large reflected both economic and
political miscalculations. The Reagan Administration
has been faulted for masking

the deficit with a "rosy scenario," but the
fact is that most of the forecasting community,
including the Congressional Budget
Office, expected positive real growth in the
economy. The administration's official forecast
differed from the rest only in its degree
of optimism. Forecasters in and out of
government were oversanguine about growth
largely because they failed to realize how
serious the Federal Reserve was about reining
in the money supply to control inflation.
The Fed was not defying the administration,
which was touting the efficacy of monetary
stringency for controlling inflation, but hardly
anyone seemed to remember that the way
tight money controls inflation is by slowing
economic activity. Moreover, as our Association'
s President-elect, Robert Eisner, has
pointed out (1986, p. 146), the economics
community, unfamiliar with a world of high
inflation rates, overestimated the stimulative
effect of the existing deficit. Added to this
was the enthusiasm of the ideological proponents
of smaller government, some of whom


### ---Economics-1987-0-05.txt---
exaggerated the possible effects of lower tax
rates on supply and some of whom simply
hoped that deficits would pressure Congress
to cut back domestic spending. The size of
the deficits was also masked by the assumption
of unspecified future spending cuts, an
assumption reflecting the view that the U.S.
government was operating a lot of wasteful
programs with little public support which
Congress could soon be persuaded to reduce
or eliminate.

Both in the administration and in Congress,
decisions were made at a breakneck
pace, in a highly charged political atmosphere,
amid conflicting claims and competing
forecasts, with little attention to the consistency
of monetary and fiscal policy and
mostly by people with little experience in
evaluating the reasonableness of any set of
economic estimates. (See David Stockman,
1986, ch. 3.) When the dust settled, we found
ourselves with a serious recession that
nobody expected, and an escalating structural
budget deficit that nobody wanted. It
was hardly economic policy's finest hour.
The agonizing-and so far only partially
successful- struggle to correct the mistakes
of 1981 have kept the economic policy process
under stress and have continued to
dramatize some of its weakest aspects. The
struggle between the president and the Congress
over deficit solutions illustrates the
price we pay for the separation of powers.
The fact that fiscal policy has become an
exercise in damage control, while the Federal
Reserve makes all the important decisions
about the economy, underlines the separation
of monetary and fiscal policy. The
sensitivity of deficits to the pace of the economy
advertises the unreliability of macroeconomic
forecasts. The fact that all the actions
that could be taken to correct the deficit are
unpleasant ones drags out the annual agony
of budget setting interminably and dramatizes
how layered and cumbersome it has
become.

Small wonder that the strains of the last
few years, with a little help from the press,
have reinforced the negative stereotypes that
economists and political decision makers
have of each other. Political decision makers
see economists as quarrelsome folks who
cannot forecast, cannot agree, cannot express
themselves clearly, and have strong
ideological biases. Economists return the
favor by regarding politicians as shortsighted,
interested only in what is popular
with the electorate, and unwilling to face
hard decisions. All of the stereotypes are
partly right.

Politicians embody their stereotype in
economist jokes. Economists have retaliated
more massively by applying the tools of their
trade to the political system itself. Public
choice theory essentially asks the question:
what would economic policy be like if our
stereotype of politicians were entirely true?
The answer provides considerable insight
into observed political behavior and certainly
helps explain why the idealistic economist
so often fails to find the system simulating
the public interest motivation of the
philosopher queen.

III. Some Drastic Nonsolutions
Widespread concern that the economic
policy process is not working well has
spawned proposals for drastic change that
move in two quite different directions: one
toward circumscribing the discretion of
elected officials by putting economic policy
on automatic pilot and the other toward
making elected officials more directly responsible
to the voters for their policies.
The automatic pilot approach 'flows from
the perspective of public choice theory that
the decisions of democratically elected officials
interested in staying in office cannot
be counted on to produce economic policy
in the social interest, but are likely to be
biased toward excessive government spending,
growing deficits, special interest tax and
spending programs, and easier money. A
way to overcome these biases is to agree in
advance on strict rules of economic policy,
such as a fixed monetary growth path or
constitutionally required balance in the
federal budget.

Even if one accepts the premises, however,
firm rules are hard to define in a rapidly
changing world -no one seems to know what
"money" is anymore-and can easily lead
to perverse results. Recent experience with


### ---Economics-1987-0-06.txt---
trying to reduce the federal deficit along
the fixed path specified by the Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings amendment, for example, has
given us a taste of some of the possible
disadvantages of a balanced budget rule.
There is danger that specific dollar targets
for the deficit will require procyclical fiscal
policy, perhaps precipitating a recession that
would then make budget balance even less
attainable. Moreover, the effort to reach the
targets can induce cosmetic or self-defeating
measures, such as moving spending from one
fiscal year to another for no valid reason,
selling assets to reduce a current deficit while
exacerbating future ones, and accomplishing
desired purposes by regulatory or other nonbudgetary
means.

The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings experience,
however, has suggested the usefulness of a
different approach to deficit reduction than a
balanced budget rule; namely, a deficit neutral
amendment rule. If legislators advocating
a tax preference are required to propose
a rate increase to pay for it, special interest
tax legislation may falter. Similarly, the requirement
that a proposal for additional
spending be accompanied by a simultaneous
proposal to raise taxes or reduce another
spending program may be an effective brake
on deficits.

The other direction of reform reflects the
contrasting view that the separation of
powers and the diffusion of responsibility in
our government make it too difficult for the
electorate to enforce its will by holding officials
responsible for their policies. The
potential for deadlock would be reduced if
the United States moved toward a parliamentary
system, or found a way to hold
political parties more strictly accountable for
proposing or carrying out identifiable policies.


Casual examination of parliamentary democracies,
such as the Untied Kingdom and
Sweden, does not provide striking evidence
of the superiority of parliamentary systems
for making economic choices, even if one did
not have two hundred years of tradition to
contend with in changing our system. The
more modest notion that our system would
work more smoothly if political parties had
better defined positions and disciplined their
elected members more strictly may well be
right, but seems to fly in the face of current
history. Voters are showing less strong party
affiliation and more inclination to choose for
themselves among candidates, while members
of Congress tend increasingly to be
pragmatists willing to work out nonideological
compromises across party lines. These
trends seem likely to be the irreversible consequences
of greater education, sophistication,
and exposure to public issues among
voters and elected officials alike and to make
a resurgence of party discipline and loyalty
unrealistic.

IV. Making the Economic Policy System
Work Better

My own proposals involve less drastic
changes in the structure of our government.
They reflect a strong faith in the ability of
informed citizens and their elected representatives
to make policy decisions for the
common good, even to make substantial
sacrifices and take political risks to further
what they perceive as the long-run national
interest-once they understand what the
choices are. I also believe that the separation
of powers between the executive and legislative
branches works pretty well most of the
time. It provides needed protection against
overzealousness in either branch, albeit at
some risk of occasional stalemate.
The main problem, it seems to me, is that
our economic policy system has gradually
become so complex, diffused, and fragmented
that it impedes rather than fosters
informed choices on major issues. The fragmentation
imposes two kinds of costs. First,
it makes the decision process itself exceedingly
inefficient. Decisions are made too
often, in too great detail, and reviewed by
too many layers of decision makers in the
executive branch and in Congress. Too much
time is absorbed in procedure and in wrangling
over details, not enough on major decisions.
It's time to simplify the process, to
weed out some of the institutions, and to tip
the balance between substance and process
back toward substance.

Second, decisions are made separately that
ought to be made together, or at least with


### ---Economics-1987-0-07.txt---
attention to their impact on each other. The
separation of monetary and fiscal policy is
one example; the separation of tax and
spending decisions is another. Congress has
made a good deal of progress in recent years
in putting spending decisions together with
their revenue or deficit consequences, but
more could be done. I have seven steps to
suggest that might make the economic policy
process work more effectively.
First, seek out decisions that should be
made less frequently and arrange to do so.
This would economize decision-making time
and enhance the chances of thoughtful,
well-informed decisions. It would free up
time and energy for managing the government
enterprise more effectively, with a
longer planning horizon. It would also reduce
the inefficiency and sense of unfairness
that goes with frequent changes of the rules.
Making the federal budget every other year
would be a major advance. Major revisions
of the tax code should occur even less frequently.
Big ticket acquisitions, such as major
weapons systems, should be reviewed thoroughly
at infrequent intervals and then put
on a steady efficient track, not constantly
revisited.

With a two-year budget, there would occasionally
be major events, such as a sudden
escalation of international tension or a sharp
unexpected shift in the economic outlook,
that would justify reopening the budget in
midstream, but the temptation to tinker frequently
should be strongly resisted. The
argument that economists cannot forecast
accurately two years in advance, while quite
true, does not undermine the case for a
multiyear budget. It simply reinforces the
point that discretionary fiscal policy is
hazardous and ought to be viewed with great
skepticism whether the budget is annual or
biennial.

Second, seek out decisions that need not
be made at all and stop making them. Some
spending programs could be consolidated
into block grants or devolved to the states,
not necessarily in the interest of smaller
government, but in the interest of greater
responsiveness to local needs and a less
cluttered federal decision schedule. In other
cases, the responsibility is clearly federal-as
in defense-but Congress would be doing its
job more effectively if it concentrated on
major policy issues rather than on details of
program management.

Third, in the executive branch, consolidate
authority for tax, budget, andfiscalpolicy
in a single cabinet department. The department
could retain the name Treasury, but
might better be called the Department of
Economic Affairs. The Secretary of Economic
Affairs should have a high level chief
economist or economic council with a strong
professional staff. The chief economist should
work closely with the budget director who
also should report to the Secretary. The purpose
would be to bring together economic
decisions now made in OMB, CEA, and
Treasury under one high-level responsible
person, to relieve the president of the duty
of adjudicating among so many potentially
warring power centers, and to increase the
chances of building a highly professional
permanent economic staff one step removed
from the short-run political concerns of the
White House.

Fourth, streamline the congressional
committee structure to reduce the number of
steps in the budget process. The authorizing
and appropriating functions should be combined
in a single set of "program committees,
" one for each major area of public
spending. This would imply a single defense
committee, for example, and a social insurance
committee. The tax committees

should handle the revenue side-not additional
spending programs as at present.
The budget committees would be charged
with considering fiscal policy and putting the
spending and revenue sides together into a
budget to be passed by the whole congress.
The Joint Economic Committee should celebrate
the important contributions it made
to economic understanding in the days before
the budget process and then close up
shop.

Fifth, bring monetary and fiscal policy
into the same conversation. This end could be
furthered by closer formal links between the
central bank and the Department of Economic
Affairs to dramatize the need for consultation
and interaction. The Federal Reserve
chairman should make a report to the


### ---Economics-1987-0-08.txt---
budget committees of Congress laying out
recommended short- and longer-run economic
goals for the nation and discussing
combinations of monetary and fiscal strategies
to achieve them. The Fed's report should
be an important input to congressional deliberations
on fiscal policy.

Sixth, strive for a government-wide official
economic forecast to be updated on a
regular schedule. The main purpose of the
common forecast would be to reduce the
confusion generated by conflicting estimates,
but the increased interaction between the
Department of Economic Affairs, the Congressional
Budget Office, and the Federal
Reserve necessary to create such a forecast
would increase mutual understanding of what
is happening to the economy and what the
goals of policy should be. Occasionally, it
might be necessary for one of the agencies to
dissent and explain why it disagreed with the
forecast, but these occasions are likely to be
infrequent. There should also be more attention
than at present to the consequences for
policy of the forecast being wrong.
Finally, bring choices explicitly into the
decision process, both in executive branch deliberations
and, especially, in Congress. Those
proposing spending increases or tax reductions
should routinely be required to specify
what is to be given up and to offer both the
benefit and its cost as a package. In other
words, proposals should be deficit neutral.
V. What Economists Can Do

For their part, how can economists be
more useful in the policy process? The press
and politicians often sound as if they are
telling us to work harder: go back to your
computers and don't come out until you
known how the economy really works and
can give us reliable forecasts. But economists
know that the economic system is incredibly
complicated, and that increasing global interdependence
and rapidly changing technologies
and public attitudes are not making it
easier to understand. It is not likely in our
lifetimes that anyone will happen on a
paradigm that explains everything, or even
that forecasting will become appreciably
more accurate. Like the medical profession,
which also deals with an incredibly complex
system, we economists just have to keep
applying our imperfect knowledge as carefully
as possible and learning from the results.
Both doctors and economists need
humility, but neither should abandon their
patients to the quacks.

The objective of economists ought to be to
raise the level of debate on economic policy,
to make clear what they know and do not
know, and to increase the chances of policy
decisions that make the economy work better.
Much of the time that means telling the
public and politicians what they would rather
not hear: hard choices must be made. We
are stuck with being the dismal science.
Increased effort in three directions would
make economics more useful in the policy
process. First, economists should put much
more emphasis on their areas of agreement.
The press admittedly makes this difficult.
Agreement is not news, and the press' stereotype
of economists' diversity of views is so
entrenched that they will go to great lengths
to scare up a lonely dissenter to an almost
universally held economic platitude and give
her equal time.

Economists realize that the breakthrough
insights around which "schools" are built
are at best partial visions of the truth, but
our training leads us to elaborate and differentiate
these insights, to explain to ourselves
and to others where they lead in
different directions, not where they come
together. Yet areas of agreement are
wide -even in macroeconomics-and a
major effort to make this clearer to ourselves
and our audience would be useful.
Second, economists should devote more
serious attention to increasing the basic economic
literacy of the public, the media, and
the political community. While the print media
seem to me increasingly knowledgeable and
sophisticated about economic issues, television,
where most people get most of their
information, lags far behind. Television
coverage of the economy is heavily weighted
to isolated economic statistics reported without
context-the wholesale price index increased
two-tenths of a percent in October
-and talking heads disagreeing, briefly, for
some obscure reason. Some of the best newscasters
appear to have bad cases of economics
phobia.


### ---Economics-1987-0-09.txt---
Media bashing is not the answer. The
profession needs to take the lead in explaining
more clearly what is happening to the
economy, why it matters, and what the arguments
are about or ought to be about. This
means more than each of us taking a little
time to make a luncheon speech, write an op
ed piece, or appear on a talk show. It means
sustained efforts on the part of teams of
economists to figure out how to present economic
ideas more interestingly and understandably,
developing new graphics and other
teaching tools and getting feedback from
real audiences. The technology is available
and the audiences exist-the number of people
who will watch long hard-to-follow congressional
debates and hearings on cable

television is quite astonishing. We just need
to devote the kind of effort and ingenuity
that goes into explaining to audiences the
complex, fast-moving, jargon-ridden game
of football to our complex, fast-moving,
jargon-ridden game of economics.
Third, economists need to be more careful
to sort out, for ourselves and others, what
we really know from our ideological biases.
George Stigler pointed out in his presidential
address (1965) that economists beginning
with Adam Smith have not hesitated to make
strong assertions, both positive and negative,
about the effectiveness of government intervention
without offering serious evidence to
support their claims. For two hundred years,
"the chief instrument of empirical demonstration
on the economic competence of

the state has been the telling anecdote"
(pp. 11-12). In the more than two decades
since Stigler presided over our Association,
an enormous amount of useful empirical
work has been done, as he predicted it would
be, on the effectiveness of government programs,
the costs and benefits of regulation,
and so forth. Still the arguments among
economists about the merits of larger vs.
smaller government too often revolve around
anecdotes or, worse, misleading statistics
quoted out of context. My own anecdotal
evidence would lead me to believe that liberals
and conservatives are about equally
guilty.

My concern is not with economists taking
sides on policy issues or acting as advocates
of particular positions. Indeed, I think many
policy debates would be clarified if there
were more formal and informal opportunities
for economists to marshall the evidence
on each side and to examine and cross-examine
each other in front of some counterpart
of judge or jury.

We economists tend to be uncomfortable
in the role of partisans or advocates, preferring
to be seen as neutral experts whether we
are or not. Lawyers move more easily among
roles; and the best are able to serve with
distinction at different times as prosecutors,
defenders, experts, and judges. The system
works well when the roles are played competently
and the rules of evidence strictly
observed. Economists might increase their
usefulness to the policy process if they made
clear at any given moment which role they
were playing. More important, we need to
work hard to raise the standards of evidence,
to make clear to the public and the participants
in the political process what we are
reasonably sure we know and how we know
it, and where we are guessing or expressing
our preferences.

It is tempting to use the audience captured
by a presidential address to pontificate about
the sad state of economics. You probably
will conclude that I have surrendered to the
temptation. But I do recognize that my good
luck in becoming president of our Association
does not automatically endow me with
commanding wisdom over all of economics.
I will do my best to stick to my knitting.
And for many years much of my research
has been directly toward investment in human
capital and the understanding of family
behavior.

Modern economists neglected the behavior
of families until the 1950s. Since then
economic analysis has been used to explain
who marries whom and when (if ever) they
divorce, the number of children and investments
in each child's human capital, the
extent and timing of labor force participation
by married women, when elderly parents
rely on children for support, and many other
family choices. A fair conclusion, I believe
(need I remind you of my biases?), is that
the economic approach contributes important
insights toward explaining the large decline
in birth rates during the past 100 years,
the rapid expansion in the labor force participation
of married women after the 1950s,
the explosive advance in divorce rates during
the past two decades, and other major
changes in the family. Family economics is
now a respectable and growing field.
Yet perhaps because family economics is a
new field, only a small literature considers
the implications for other parts of economics.
The family is such an important
institution that progress in understanding
how it behaves is justification enough for
any discipline. But most economists, including
the audience here, are not particularly
concerned about family behavior. Your interest
must be stimulated through a demonstration
that its study helps in the analysis of
other problems.

In this address I try to maintain your
interest by exploring the contribution to
macroeconomics from the progress in family
economics. This is a challenge not only because
macro behavior is a central part of
economics but also because its link to the
family may seem remote and unimportant.
By macroeconomics I mean the analysis of
economywide behavior. Much of the time is
spent on long-term economic growth, although
I also discuss short and long cycles in
economic activity, and the interaction between
overlapping generations through Social
Security, transmission of inequality, and
in other ways.

Of course, one paper even by a macro
expert cannot do justice to these topics, and
I do not pretend to be such an expert. My
purpose is to help you recognize that many
conclusions in these and presumably other
macro areas change radically when family
choices get the attention they deserve. I
apologize for the technical nature of some of
the discussion that may seem out of place in
a presidential address.

I. The Malthusian and Neoclassical Models
In considering the relation between economic
growth and the family, it is natural to
begin with Thomas Malthus's great contribution.
Although usually called the Malthusian
theory of population growth, a more
appropriate name is the Malthusian theory


### ---Economics-1988-0-04.txt---
of wages and average income. His first
monograph, subtitled "With Remarks on the
Speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet,
and Other Writers," begins with an objection
to the conclusion of these writers that the
economic position of mankind will continue
to improve over time. In the process of rebutting
their arguments, Malthus develops
his famous theory of population growth and
reaches much more pessimistic conclusions
about the long-term economic prospects of
the average family.

You will recall that the Malthusian model
assumes diminishing returns to increases in
the level of population-that is, to increases
in employment-when land and other capital
are fixed. The analytical heart of his model
(I am not concerned with the details of what
he actually said) is consistent with constant
returns to the scale of labor and capital, as
long as the capital stock, including usable
land, does not respond to changes in wages
and interest rates.

The response of fertility and mortality to
changes in income determine the Malthusian
supply of population. Population grows more
slowly when wages are low because the average
person marries later and thereby has
fewer children (the preventive check on
population), and also because deaths increase
when families are poorer (the positive
check). Historical studies indicate that the
effect of the economy on age at marriage was
considerably greater, at least in Europe, than
was its effect on death rates (see Ronald D.
Lee, 1987b, pp. 450-51). Therefore, I will
ignore the positive effect and consider only
the preventive check through changes in the
number of children.

The long-run equilibrium wage rate is
found at the point on the positively inclined
population supply curve where the average
family has two children. The economy's production
function then determines the stationary
level of population that is consistent
with this long-run wage rate. There is no
presumption that this equilibrium wage is at
the subsistence level, especially if the positive
check through death rates is not important.
In this model tastes for marriage
and children, not vague notions of subsistence,
determine long-run wages.

The long-run wage is stable in the Malthusian
model when shocks push the system
out of equilibrium. For example, if an infectious
disease destroys much of the population,
as the Black Death destroyed perhaps
25 percent of certain European populations
during the fourteenth century, the decline in
population raises the marginal productivity
of labor. The resulting rise in wages encourages
families to marry earlier and have more
children. Population begins to grow and its
increase over time lowers wage rates back
toward equilibrium. Ultimately, this dynamic
process restores both the wage rate
and the level of population to their long-run
levels.

If the amount of usable land increases,
wages rise and that stimulates higher birth
rates. Again, the growth in population continues
to lower wage rates until eventually
the long-run wage is restored. However,
population is permanently higher because
the amount of land is greater.
This example brings out that the equilibrium
wage is more immune to shocks in
the Malthusian system than is the level of
population. Indeed, if tastes are stable over
time-the Malthusian model, along with
George Stigler and myself (1977), assumes
de gustibus non est disputandum -and if
technology does not continue to improve,
the equilibrium wage rate remains fixed by
the point on the stable supply curve where
the typical couple has two surviving children.
The Malthusian model does help some in
explaining very long-term changes in
European wage rates prior to the nineteenth
century (Lee, 1987b, gives a good analysis of
the evidence). People evidently married
earlier when wages were above the equilibrium
level and married later when they
were below.

It is ironic that Malthus's first essay on
population was published in 1798 at the
close of the eighteenth century. Although his
system was accepted by many leading
economists of the nineteenth century (see
John Stuart Mill, 1848, Book I, ch. X), events
after publication were not kind to the theory.
Fertility eventually fell sharply rather
than rose as wage rates and per capita incomes
continued to advance during much of


### ---Economics-1988-0-05.txt---
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the
United States, Western Europe, and Japan.
The contradiction between the theory and
events explains why most economists during
the first half of this century showed little
interest in explaining long-term trends in
income and population. But the subject
is too important to remain neglected, and
Robert Solow, David Cass, and others developed
the neoclassical growth model in the
1950s and early 1960s. This model incorporates
two major advances over the Malthusian
model. Each person maximizes utility
that depends on present and future consumption.
More important is the recognition
that changes in the capital stock respond to
rates of return on investments. Unfortunately,
the neoclassical model also takes a
sizable step backward from Malthus by assuming
that fertility and other dimensions of
population growth are independent of wages,
incomes, and prices.

I trust that the basic properties of a simple
neoclassical model are familiar. What may
not be generally appreciated is that despite
the different assumptions, the analytic structures
of the neoclassical and Malthusian
models are quite close and many of their
implications are similar. If technology and
preferences do not change over time, both
models have stable steady-state levels of per
capita income. The neoclassical equilibrating
mechanism works through changes in the
rate of investment, while the Malthusian
mechanism works through changes in the
rate of population growth. To illustrate, if
the capital-labor ratio exceeds its steady-state
level, the rate of return on capital is below
and the wage rate is above their steady-state
levels. In the neoclassical model this discourages
investment, which lowers the capitallabor
ratio over time (with exogenous population
growth). In the Malthusian model this
encourages population growth, which also
lowers the capital-labor ratio over time (with
exogenous investment in capital). We have
seen that a shock to population in the
Malthusian model has no effect on the level
of population or per capita income in the
long run. Similarly, in the neoclassical model
a shock to the capital stock (perhaps wartime
destruction of capital) has no long-run effect
on the aggregate capital stock or per capita
income.

The persistent growth in per capita incomes
during the past two centuries is no
easier to explain within the neoclassical
framework than within the Malthusian. Of
course, the neoclassical model postulates exogenous
technological progress to "explain"
continuing growth in per capita incomes, but
the need to rely on "exogenous" progress is
a confession of failure to explain growth
within the model. Moreover, the Malthusian
model can equally well postulate exogenous
progress to "explain" persistent growth.
II. The Family and Economic Growth
After a short while the economics profession
became disenchanted with the neoclassical
model, presumably because it too did
not help in understanding progress. The excitement
reflected in hundreds of papers that
extended and elaborated this model in the
1950s and 1960s gave way during the past
fifteen years to a lack of interest in the
analytics of growth that is a little reminiscent
of the situation during the first half
of the century.

Fortunately, a more relevant growth model
is available through combining the best features
of the neoclassical and MIalthusian
models and by adding a focus on investment
in knowledge and skills. The neoclassicists
are right to emphasize endogenous capital
accumulation and utility maximization.
Malthusians are right to stress the response
of fertility and other components of population
growth to changes in the economy, and
that these responses can greatly influence
economic change.

I will sketch out a modified neoclassical
model where parents choose both the number
of children and the capital (human or
physical) bequeathed to each child. Parental
altruism or "love" toward children provides
a powerful framework for the analysis of
both the quantity and so-called quality of
children. Altruism means that the utility of
parents depends on the utility of each child.
The assumption of altruism is realistic for
the vast majority of families, although
parent-child interactions are determined also


### ---Economics-1988-0-06.txt---
by other motives. Presumably, the altruism
per child is negatively related to the number
of children, so that an additional child lowers
the utility per child to parents in the same
way as (please excuse the analogy) an additional
car lowers the utility per car.
Such altruism is easily grafted onto the
neoclassical utility function by letting parents'
utility depend on their own life-cycle
consumption and separately on their degree
of altruism per child, the number of children,
and the utility of each child. This formulation
has the important implication that preference
for parents' relative to children's consumption
(so-called time preference) is not
exogenous but rises as the number of children
increases.

The resources available to parents from
the capital they inherit and labor earnings
are spent either on own consumption, on the
costs of rearing children, or on transfers to
children of human and other capital. Since
child rearing is time intensive, the cost of
rearing children is positively related to the
value of parents' time. Income per capita
would rise between the parents' and the
child's generations if the total capital bequeathed
to each child exceeds the capital
inherited by each parent.

Parents choose optimal values of their own
consumption, the number of children, and
capital transferred to each child while taking
into account the cost of rearing children and
the dependence of their utility on the utility
of children. This analysis has many implications
for the behavior of fertility that Robert
Barro and I explore elsewhere (see 1987 and
1988). Here I concentrate on a few that alter
implications of the neoclassical model about
capital accumulation and growth.
If the number of children demanded by
the typical family is positively related to the
income of parents (the Malthusian assumptions)
, or at least if it is not strongly negatively
related, then this model also has stable
steady-state levels of the capital-labor ratio
and per capita income. But these steady
states depend on variables that change the
demand for children.

One example is the consequences of an
extended but temporary decline in income
and productivity-perhaps due to the disorganization
induced by a lengthy depression.
In the neoclassical model this has no
long-run effect on either per capita or aggregate
income. In our modified model an
extended decline in productivity can permanently
lower aggregate income because birth
rates may fall when productivity, wages, and
interest rates fall. Recall the sharp decline in
birth rates during the Great Depression.
Just over a decade age, Barro (1974)
showed that a dose of family economics
radically alters traditional conclusions about
the effects of budget deficits on private savings.
For example, deficits to finance Social
Security payments tax future generations to
support the elderly. Altruistic parents who
leave bequests to their children do not seek
an intergeneration redistribution of incomes,
so they would increase their bequests to offset
the effect on children of future taxes. If these
families are common, Social Security payments
and other public expenditures financed
by taxes on future generations would not
have much effect on private savings. This is
the so-called Ricardian equivalence theorem.
A larger dose of family economics gives
more radical implications in some respects
but also has more conventional implications
for the relation between Social Security and
savings. Various comments on Ricardian
equivalence emphasize that some families do
not leave bequests; I will discuss these families
in Section IV. Development economists
have long recognized that parents value
children who provide support during old age.
A Social Security system that replaces child
support of parents with public support raises
the net cost of children to parents (not to
society) since they are no longer as useful to
elderly parents. As a result, a Social Security
system tends to reduce the demand for
children. Social Security also reduces the
demand for children by parents who do not
receive support but provide bequests. The
net cost of children to these parents also
increases when they raise bequests to offset
the effect of Social Security taxes on children.
For reasons given earlier, a lower demand
for children raises the capital bequeathed to
each child. Therefore, Social Security and
other public transfers between generations
would raise private savings per child, and as


### ---Economics-1988-0-07.txt---
a result, raise wage rates and the capital-labor
ratio in the next generation. Yet total private
savings of the present generations would fall,
as in a conventional life-cycle analysis with
no bequests, if the decline in fertility exceeds
the greater saving for each child.
Consider next an example from tax incidence.
A tax on income from capital initially
lowers after-tax returns and discourages investment.
In the neoclassical model, capital
then falls over time until the after-tax rate of
return again equals the given rate of time
preference. In public finance jargon, a tax on
capital would be fully shifted in the long
run.

A difficulty with this conclusion is the
neoclassical assumption that fertility is fixed,
which is especially inappropriate for very
long-term changes in incidence. Fertility
would fall as capital fell in response to the
tax if fertility is positively related to per
capita income. A fall in fertility lowers preference
for present consumption and raises
the demand for investment in each child
through the interaction between the quality
and quantity of children. Then the equilibrium
after-tax rate of return must also
fall, and the tax on capital is only partially
shifted even in the long run.

The conclusion is more radical if fertility
is negatively related to per capita income
(for reasons discussed next). Fertility then
increases when the stock of capital falls.
Since the increase in fertility lowers investment
per child, the equilibrium after-tax rate
of return would have to increase. That is, we
have the paradox that a tax on capital is
eventually shifted by more than 100 percent!
Let me assure the theorists that this strange
result does not violate the second-order conditions.


Does a negative relation between fertility
and per capita income imply that children
are an "inferior" good (to use the economist's
infelicitous language)? The answer is no because
the cost of rearing children increases
when the capital-labor ratio and per capita
income rise since wage rates and the value of
parents' time spent on children rise along
with the capital-labor ratio. Fertility would
fall if the positive effect on fertility of an
increase in income is weaker than the negative
effect due to the rise in cost. The substitution
effect often dominates the income
effect in rich countries, for child care in these
countries requires considerable time and energy
of parents.

If fertility is negatively related to per capita
income, an increase in the capital-labor ratio
above its steady-state level would reduce
fertility and thereby encourage more investment
per child. The capital-labor ratio would
continue to increase over time if this positive
effect on investment dominates the negative
effect of a lower rate of return. Consequently,
a negative relation between fertility
and per capita income can destabilize what
is otherwise a stable steady state (see the
formal analysis in Robert Tamura, 1986).
Demographers have long been aware that
fertility eventually declines as a country
develops. Less well appreciated (although
see the earlier literature by R. R. Nelson,
1956; Robert M. Solow, 1956, pp. 90-91;
S. C. Tsiang, 1964, and others on low-level
" traps") is that a negative relation between a
country's fertility and its income can destabilize
a steady-state equilibrium and cause
a protracted period of rising per capita incomes.
However, although a decline in fertility
is an important stimulus in early stages of
development, it alone cannot explain sustained
growth over a century or longer. In
the absence of other forces, a growing economy
with neoclassical production functions
but without continuing technological progress
eventually moves to a stable steady
state with low fertility and high per capita
incomes.

A promising approach to sustained growth
that complements the role of fertility builds
on the special properties of education and
other learning. The important property for
this purpose is that investments in education
and other human capital are more productive
when past investments are larger. That
is to say, accumulation of knowledge and
skills in the past eases the acquisition of
additional knowledge. The mastery learning
concept in education pedagogy uses this
property to organize the teaching of mathematics
and other subjects to children (see
Benjamin S. Bloom, 1976). Such a production
technology implies that rates of return


### ---Economics-1988-0-08.txt---
on investments in human capital may not
fall and may even rise as the stock of human
capital grows.

Perhaps it was reasonable in Malthus's
time to neglect investments in human capital,
but there is little excuse for the neglect in
neoclassical growth theory. Modern economies
spend enormous amounts on education
and other training of children, and parents'
investments in children are a far more important
source of an economy's capital stock
than are bequests or the life-cycle accumulation
of physical capital. Dale Jorgenson and
Barbara Fraumeni (1987) estimate that human
capital comprises over 70 percent of the
total capital stock in the United States. This
estimate may be too low because it does not
include the contribution of human capital to
output in the household sector (the authors
do try to estimate household output). Seventy
percent may be higher than the true
fraction because it makes no allowance for
the contribution of "raw labor" to output. I
would guess that the true ratio of human
capital to the total capital stock may be as
high as 90 percent or as low as 50 percent.
Of course, even this lower percentage signifies
a large contribution. The neglect of
human capital in wealth and income accounts
greatly distorts comparisons of savings propensities
and the accumulation of wealth.
Only recently have growth models begun
to appreciate the potential of the learningby-
having property of human capital for
generating sustained growth in per capita
incomes (see Paul Romer, 1986; Robert E.
Lucas, Jr., 1988; and Robert G. King and
Sergio Rebelo, 1986; pioneering earlier work
includes Kenneth J. Arrow, 1962; Yoram
Ben-Porath, 1967; Hirofumi Uzawa, 1965;
and Sherwin Rosen, 1976). Kevin M. Murphy
and I are developing an analysis that combines
such a human capital technology with
unskilled labor, physical capital, and endogenous
fertility that results from altruism. (See
Gary S. Becker, 1971, pp. 204, 207-208, for
an earlier effort to combine human capital,
unskilled labor, and physical capital.) Our
model has a " Malthusian" equilibrium where
per capita income is constant and low and
fertility is high. However, if this equilibrium
receives big enough technology and other
shocks-good luck may be required-the
economy takes off toward a perpetual growth
equilibrium with a decline in fertility and
increased investment per child. Knowledge
continues to grow through its embodiment
in additional human capital.

Family economics is critical to the analysis
since choices about number of children
and investments in each child's human
capital helps determine whether the economy
ends up at a "good" (i.e., growth) equilibrium
or at a "bad" (i.e., Malthusian) equilibrium.
Obviously, we do not have the full
answer to economic growth-public policies,
conglomeration effects, and other considerations
are surely important-but I do believe
that our story contributes a sizable part of
the answer.

III. Short and Long Cycles

Let me now turn briefly to the relation
between family behavior and cycles in aggregate
output and other variables. For centuries
marriages, births, and other family
behavior have been known to respond to
fluctuations in aggregate output and prices.
In an early use of regression analysis in the
social sciences, G. Udny Yule (1906) demonstrated
that English marriages and births
in the nineteenth century moved together
with the business cycle. Subsequent studies
showed that higher order as well as first
births, divorce rates, and possibly the labor
force participation of secondary workers
all fluctuated procyclically in many countries
(see, for example, Becker, 1960, and
Morris Silver, 1965). Birth rates in the United
States apparently became countercyclical
after many married women entered the labor
force. Children are cheaper during recessions
because the value of time spent on children
by working mothers is low then (see William
P. Butz and Michael P. Ward, 1979). Investments
in education and other human capital
are much less procyclical than investments
in physical capital also because the foregone
value of time spent in school is cheaper
during bad times (Linda N. Edwards, 1975).
Of course, none of the competing macro
models of business cycles-be they Keynesian,
monetarist, neoclassical, or real-rely


### ---Economics-1988-0-09.txt---
on family behavior to cause business cycles.
However, declining population growth was a
major cause of the secular stagnation feared
by Alvin H. Hansen (1939) in his presidential
address to our Association almost fifty
years ago. Family behavior may play more
than a negligible role even in generating
ordinary business cycles. For example, an
increase in the labor supply of married women
or young people when household work
or school becomes less attractive can induce
cyclical responses in aggregate output and
other variables. Cycles started by shifts in
labor supply induce a negative relation between
wage rates and aggregate output over
business cycles. This would help explain why
cyclical fluctuations in real wages appear to
be less positively related to cyclical fluctuations
in aggregate output than is implied by
business cycles models that emphasize the
demand side.

Although family behavior presumably has
only a small part in the generation of
ordinary business cycles, it is likely to be
crucial to long cycles in economic activity.
Malthus claimed that family choices
cause long-term fluctuations in the economy
through the lagged effects first of marriages
on births and then of births on the size of
the labor force (see Maw Lin Lee and David
Loschky, 1987). Modern demographic analysis
generates long cycles in population growth
rates through the relation between aggregate
fertility and the age distribution, and perhaps
also between fertility and the size of a
cohort (see, for example, James C. Frauenthal
and Kenneth E. Swick, 1983, and Ronald
Lee, 1987a). In our modified Malthus-neoclassical
model, family choices cause long
cycles not only in population growth, but
also in capital, output, and other variables if
the elasticity of the degree of altruism per
child with respect to the number of children
declines as families get larger, a reasonable
assumption. Fertility and per capita income
then fluctuate in generation-long cycles whenever
the economy is disturbed away from the
steady state (for a proof, see Jess Benhabib
and Kazuo Nishimura, 1986).

In the 1920s, the Russian economist
Nicholas D. Kondratieff claimed that capitalist
economies exhibit long-term fluctuations
of about fifty years' duration in output
and prices (see Kondratieff, 1935). Simon
Kuznets (1958) later argued that long-term
fluctuations only last about twenty years. If
long cycles of the Kondratieff or Kuznets
type exist-we will need another 200 years
of data to determine whether they do exist
or are just a statistical figment of an overactive
imagination-they almost certainly will
depend on fertility and other family decisions
that biologically require a long time to
implement.

IV. Overlapping Generations

The intrinsic risks faced by the elderly,
sick, and unemployed are surely no greater
in rich countries like Germany and the
United States than in poor countries like
China and India, nor do these risks rise as a
country develops. Yet the first large-scale
Social Security program was introduced by
Germany a mere 100 years ago. China, India,
and numerous other countries still have
only modest programs that exclude many of
their old people. We take publicly financed
schools for granted, but they were unimportant
until the latter half of the nineteenth
century. Public and private programs that
protect against the consequences of illness
and unemployment are even newer and less
common than Social Security and public
schools.

Throughout history the risks faced by the
elderly, young, sick, and unemployed have
been met primarily by the family, not by
state transfers, private charity, or private
insurance. Children usually cared for elderly
or infirm parents, the unemployed looked to
their families for temporary support, and
parents have spent much time, money, and
energy to rear and train their children. Despite
the rapid growth of Social Security
payments in the past few decades, almost 20
percent of women aged 65 and over in the
United States still live with their children.
The altruism and love of parents, children,
spouses, and other relatives have helped protect
family members against the hazards of
childhood, old age, and other risks. When
altruism is insufficient-unfortunately, it
often is-what sociologists call social norms


### ---Economics-1988-0-10.txt---
frequently emerge that pressure children,
parents, spouses, and other relatives into
helping out family members in need. In addition,
family members use their frequent
interaction with one another to raise the
level of guilt experienced by a member when
he or she does not help out.

The formal analysis of the interaction
among overlapping generations began with
Paul A. Samuelson's brilliant paper in 1958.
This spawned an enormous literature that
continues up to the present. Although
Samuelson had relevant obiter dicta about
social compacts, altruism, and family obligations,
his model and that of most of the
subsequent literature assumes that each person
enters the analysis as a young adult
without personal connections to older cohorts.
A long review of overlapping generation
models in the recent New Palgrave Dictionary
(see John Geanakoplos, 1987) has no
discussion whatsoever of familial relations
between members of overlapping generations.
I claim that the neglect of childhood
and of the intimate relations among parents,
children, husbands-wives, and other family
members misled these studies sometimes into
focusing on minor problems and diverted
attention away from some important consequences
of the overlapping of generations
(the discussion in the next few paragraphs
draws partly on Becker and Murphy, 1988).
One example of the emphasis on unimportant
problems is the concern with the
plight of older people when there are few
durable assets that can finance consumption
at old age. In an influentual literature on the
demand for money, the social role of money
is even attributed to a durability that
enables older people to finance consumption
by selling to the next generation money
accumulated when young (see, for example,
Thomas Sargent, 1987, ch. 7, and Neil
Wallace, 1980). Yet when anthropologists
study simple societies that do not have money
or other durable assets, they find that old
people finance their consumption mainly
by relying for support on children and
other kin. Indeed, children have been an
important resource and money balances an
unimportant resource of the elderly in practically
all societies, whether simple or complicated.


General equilibrium theorists are concerned
about the continuum of equilibria,
inefficiency, and other problems that arise in
models where overlapping-generations persist
indefinitely into the future (see, for example,
Geanakoplos, 1987, or Timothy J.
Kehoe, 1987). Although these problems
would not completely disappear, I conjecture
that they would be much less important
if overlapping-generations models incorporated
the informal trades and assistance
available to parents, children, and other
members of the same family.

Ever since Plato's Republic, philosophers
have worried about whether parents invest
sufficiently in the health, skills, and morals
of their children. Overlapping-generations
models usually neglect childhood and concentrate
on savings by young adults and
their trades with old adults. The treatment of
children by parents not only is so important
in its own right, but it also greatly influences
the relations between older and younger
adults (Allan Drazen, 1978, is one of the few
earlier studies that recognizes the importance
of investments in children for overlapping-
generations models.)

I cannot do more on this occasion than
present the bare bones of an analysis of how
families respond to the demands of both old
age and childhood. The analysis is straightforward
when altruistic parents leave bequests
to their children. The combination of
altruism and bequests eliminates any difficulties
in financing the wealth-maximizing
investment in children's health, training, and
other human capital. For if the marginal rate
of return on additional human capital exceeds
the rate on assets, both parents and
children would be better off with additional
capital. Parents can save less to offset the
negative effect on their consumption of
greater spending on their children's human
capital, and they can reduce bequests to
offset the effect of lower savings on consumption
at old age.

Bequests also partly insulate parents from
many risks of old age. The opportunity to
draw on bequests provides an annuity-like


### ---Economics-1988-0-11.txt---
protection against an usually long life and
other risks of old age. For example, parents
who live longer than expected reduce bequests
to help finance consumption in the
additional years. If bequests are not a large
part of children's assets, bequests can give
elderly parents excellent protection against
various hazards, and yet changes in bequests
do not have much influence on children's
welfare. In effect, children help support their
parents in old age, although their support is
not fully voluntary.

The analysis is less simple when parents
do not leave bequests, perhaps because they
are not very altruistic or because they expect
their children to be better off than they are.
These families tend to underinvest in children
and underprotect parents against the hazards
of old age because bequests are not available
to finance investments and old-age support.
Social norms, feelings of guilt, and similar
mechanisms may greatly moderate the degree
of underinvestments and underprotection.
They can induce even selfish parents to
invest in children and selfish children to care
for sick or poor parents. Economists neglect
concepts like norms and guilt because no
one really knows how they evolve. Moreover,
sociologists (perhaps I should say "we" sociologists
since I am now officially also a sociologist)
are too prone to use norms as a
deus ex machina to explain behavior that is
difficult to explain in other ways. Nevertheless,
there can be little doubt that norms and
other intangible mechanisms do greatly affect
the relations between family members in
many societies, although presumably, they
do not work as well as bequests in linking
generations together.

Parents in richer countries have more resources
to spend on children and to protect
against the hazards of old age. Why then
have public expenditures on both the young
and old grown rapidly during the 100 years
as western countries as they have become
richer? One reason is that social norms are
weaker in the anonymous urban communities
of industrial countries where elderly
parents often live far from adult children. A
more analytically tractable reason is the high
rates of return in modern industrial societies
on investments in the health and training of
children. Recall my discussion of the role of
human capital in economic development.
Parents are eager to finance profitable investments
in children called for by economic
development, as long as they can draw on
gifts and bequests that they would give to
children. But gifts and bequests would become
nil in many families that invest a lot in
their children. These families would underinvest
in children, particularly when pressure
from norms is weak. The growth in public
support of schooling and other investments
in children as countries develop would then
appear to be mainly a response to the positive
effect of economic development on the
benefits from human capital.

Since families that do not leave bequests
are vulnerable to the hazards of old age, it is
not difficult to understand why public expenditures
on Social Security and medical
care for the elderly have also grown rapidly
in industrial countries. However, you may be
surprised to find out that public expenditures
on the old have not been at the expense
of the young. Since 1940 in the United States,
the ratio of expenditures per child under age
22 to expenditures per adult age 65 or over
has hardly changed. Our analysis that combines
investments in human capital with oldage
support does explain why expenditures
on the old and young grew in tandem. By
contrast, the popular view of generation
fighting-that public expenditures on the
elderly grew rapidly because the old became
politically powerful as they became more
numerous-cannot explain why expenditures
on children grew just as rapidly.
The overlapping-generation framework is
also a natural one to consider inequality and
the transmission of wealth and poverty across
generations. Families help perpetuate inequality
because children inherit abilities and
other "endowments" from parents. Moreover,
parents are the major source of the
assets and human capital of children. This
enormous influence of the family led my
esteemed teacher, Frank H. Knight, to claim
that ".where the family is the social unit, the
inheritance of wealth, culture, educational
advantages, and economic opportunities


### ---Economics-1988-0-12.txt---
tend toward the progressive increase of inequality.
.." (1935, p. 50).

Abilities and other endowments regress
downward from parents to children in successful
families where parents earn a lot, and
they regress upward in unsuccessful families
where parents earn little. The poor underinvest
in each child also because they have
larger families and less stable marriages.
Therefore, children from poorer families tend
to earn more than their parents but below
the average of their generation, and children
from richer families tend to earn less than
their parents but above their generation's
average.

Earnings depend not only on endowments
but also on investments in human capital.
Our earlier analysis implies that richer families
do not tend to underinvest in their
children's human capital because these
families leave gifts and bequests. Poorer
families do tend to underinvest in children
because they are not likely to leave gifts and
bequests. The poor underinvest in each child
also because they have large families and less
stable marriages. Therefore, the relation between
the earning of fathers and sons in
richer families would depend mainly on the
relation between endowments, while the relation
between earnings of fathers and sons
in poorer families would depend also on the
degree of underinvestment in children. Put
differently, without offsetting government
subsidies to investments in the human capital
of poorer children, low earnings would be
more persistent across generations than high
earnings -the so-called "culture of poverty"
across generations would exceed the "culture
of privilege."

In every country with data that I have
seen-this includes the United States and
several European countries (see Table 1 in
Becker and Nigel Tomes, 1986), a few Asian
countries, and some Latin American countries
(James J. Heckman and Joseph V. Hotz,
1986, consider the evidence for Panama)
earnings strongly regress to the mean between
fathers and sons. Probably much less
than 40 percent of the earnings advantages
or disadvantages of fathers pass to sons, and
few earnings advantages or disadvantages
survive three generations. Evidently, abilities
and other endowments that generate earnings
are only weakly transmitted from
parents to children. This tendency to go
from "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves" in three
generations began long before industrialization
and government support of education
and other human capital. The fourteenth
Arab historian and philosopher, Ibn Khaldtun
said (I owe this reference to my wife, Guity
Nashat), "Prestige is an accident that affects
human beings. It comes into being and decays
inevitably.... It reaches its end in a
single family within four successive generations.
" (1958, p. 279)... "As a rule, no dynasty
lasts beyond the [span] of three generations.
" (p. 343)

In all these countries, low earnings as well
as high earnings are not strongly transmitted
from fathers to sons, and Knight's claim
about family life causing growing inequality
is inconsistent with the evidence. Still, data
for both the United States and England do
appear to confirm the implication of our
theory that low earnings persist more than
high earnings across generations (see W.
Stanley Siebert, 1987). Of course, incomes of
the rich regress down more slowly between
generations than do their earnings because
rich children receive gifts and bequests
from parents (see Becker and Tomes, 1986,
Table 2).

V. Concluding Remarks

I was attracted to the family by its obvious
importance in all countries, no matter
what the economic system or stage of development.
People spend much of their time
in a dependency relation-toward parents
when children and toward grown children in
old age-marriage is a crucial step for most
people, children absorb time, energy, and
money from their parents, divorce often
causes economic hardship and mental depression,
and so forth. Economic studies of
the family are growing at a steady pace and
they are influencing the way other social
scientists look this fundamental institution.
The economic analysis of family behavior
stimulated the development of techniques


### ---Economics-1988-0-13.txt---
and prospectives that already has affected
many parts of microeconomics, especially
agricultural and labor economics, but also
the study of industrial organization and
preference theory. For example, the treatment
of marriage as a sorting of men and
women into small "partnerships" through a
reasonably efficient marriage market influenced
the analysis of how workers and
managers are allocated to different firms.
Viewing divorce as a joint decision by
husbands and wives based largely on information
gathered from living together encouraged
some studies of employment separations
to blur the analytical distinction
between quits and layoffs and to emphasize
the information about working conditions
and productivity gathered from on-the-job
experience.

The message of this address, however, is
not the importance of the family per se, even
though family welfare is the principal goal of
a well-run economic system. Nor that analytical
techniques developed to understand
family choices are valuable in other parts of
economics. The message is that family behavior
is active, not passive, and endogenous,
not exogenous. Families have large
effects on the economy, and evolution of the
economy greatly changes the structure and
decisions of families. I illustrated how families
and the economy interact through a discussion
of economic growth and other issues
in macroeconomics. A heightened awareness
of the interaction between economic change
and family choices will hasten the incorporation
of family life into the mainstream of
economics.

### ---Economics-1989-0-03.txt---
Four decades ago, in a brilliant review of
Burns and Mitchell's classic work on business
cycles, Tjalling Koopmans (1947)
sounded a warning against "Measurement
Without Theory." Without theoretical hypotheses
and constructs to orient investigation
and interpret findings, economists risk
the fate of the blind man studying the elephant.


Recent excursions in vector autoregressions
possibly aside, modem econometrics
has generally followed the path of specifying
theoretical relations that make sense in terms
of economic behavior and using empirical
data of time-series or cross sections or both
to estimate the parameters of those relations.
A critical problem, only one surface of which
is touched by Robert Lucas' famous "Critique"
(1976, 1981a), is that key arguments
in most functions are expected values-or
worse, probability distributions-of future
variables. These are generally not observed
and we are reduced to estimating parameters
of current and past variables, for which we
have data we can put into our computers,
and making explicit or, more often, implicit
assumptions about the relation between them
and the relevant but unobservable expectations.


The frailties of all this have long been
apparent in estimation of demand and supply
functions for individual commodities. We
cannot, after all, even be sure of confirming
the "law of demand," that lower prices will
increase quantities demanded. They probably
will not, if they are associated with
expectations of still lower prices in the
future.

Similar critical problems emerged in estimation
of key relations in macroeconomics.
Will an increase in the quantity of money
reduce long-term interest rates? Not, we are
told, if it generates an increased expectation
of inflation or, perhaps, an expectation that
the increase in money will be short-lived and
be reversed in future action by the monetary
authority. What, though, were the expectations,
with regard to inflation or future monetary
operations, that generated the data used
in estimating money demand functions? Can
we be sure that these same expectational
relations apply when we try to forecast the
results of a proposed easing of monetary
policy? And is the assumption that expectations
are "rational" of much help if they are
frequently, as John M. Keynes argued, built
on such uncertain knowledge as to be a
fragile phenomenon of social interaction?
The problem of bringing in critical expectational
variables is brought front and center
in Franco Modigliani's life cycle (1954) and
Milton Friedman's permanent income (1957)
versions of Keynes' consumption function.
Serious problems remain here in considerable
part because of our difficulties predicting
agents' reactions to uncertainty regarding
not only future income but expected
length of life. We thus lack two parameters
defining the resources per unit of time available
for lifetime or permanent consumption.


Difficulties are most excruciating with regard
to investment, which is entirely forward


### ---Economics-1989-0-04.txt---
looking. We introduce as arguments of investment
functions such variables as current
and past output, sales, or utilization of capacity,
current or past profits, cash flow or
measures of liquidity, and current or past
interest rates, depreciation rates, and relative
rental price or user costs of capital. Yet our
theory tells us that the arguments we generally
need are again the expected future values
of these variables. Firms should invest if
they expect the future demand for output to
be high, if they expect the cost of capital to
be higher in the future than now, and if they
look to higher future profits as a consequence
of current investment, but little if at
all in response to current or past values of
these variables.

But these difficulties in finding proxies for
usually unobservable expectations of the future
are only part of the overall problem.
Somehow, econometricians, theorists, and
economic analysts of all stripes have lost
essential communication with the compilers
and synthesizers of their data. As a consequence,
popular discourse, policymaking,
and basic principles of economics have suffered
inordinate confusion. I shall offer this
indictment, in particular, with regard to discussion
of the major macroeconomic variables
with which we are most concerned:
income, output, employment, prices, and
productivity; consumption, saving, investment,
and capital formation; wealth, assets
and liabilities, debt, and deficits. To put
matters bluntly, many of us have literally
not known what we are talking about, or
have confused our listeners-and ourselves
-into thinking that what we are talking
about is directly relevant to the matters with
which we are concerned. In some cases the
confusions do not make all that much difference,
but often they do.'

I. Measures of Income and Product
Take income for starters. We all know
what we mean by income, don't we? Or
do we? The theoretical Hicks-Haig-Simons
(J. R. Hicks, 1940, 1946, 1948; Robert Haig,
1921; Henry Simons, 1938) concept of income
is that which we can consume while
keeping our real wealth intact. But this is a
far cry from the usual measures of individual
incomes, corporate profits or the aggregates
of personal and national income.
First, we allow for capital consumptionthe
depreciation of existing capital-in
measuring income. We may note that capital
consumption allowances with capital consumption
adjustment were 8.22 percent of
GNP in 1951 before the move to permanently
higher tax depreciation allowances
began, were 9.14 percent of GNP by 1960,
11.69 percent by 1983, and 11.98 percent in
1987. Did production really become more
capital-intensive, did the capital mix truly
turn that much less durable,2 or is it possible
that we are overstating capital consumption
and understating national and personal income
and net saving, both in absolute
amounts and as compared to the past?
What about capital gains and losses? If
the value of our stock or bond or house goes
up, can we not consume the gain in addition
to what is usually counted as income, and
still keep our wealth intact? We must indeed
distinguish between the nominal gain and
the real gain, that is, the increase in nominal
value over and above the increase that
would be necessary to compensate for general
inflation. But should not the real gain, in
conformity with the Hicks-Haig-Simons concept,
which I shall denote as "theory," be
included in properly measured income?


### ---Economics-1989-0-05.txt---
If nominal interest rates are 9 percent and
inflation runs at 4 percent, should we include
all of interest receipts in income? Or should
we not recognize that 4 percent of the value
of existing interest-bearing securities is being
eaten away each year by inflation? Must not
this amount be taken out of interest receipts,
to keep capital intact, before we can recognize
income? In fact, of course, we do not do
this in our measures of personal income or
national income or the distribution of income
or anywhere else, to my knowledge-or
even in the computation of taxable income.
Our national income statistics include imputations
for a number of nonmarket items
of output including, most importantly, net
rent of owner-occupied housing. But what
about automobiles and other durable goods?
Are the transportation services of a car consumption
when we rent one from Hertz or
Avis but not consumption if we own the car
ourselves? But if they are consumption, are
we not obliged to include their value, net of
the car's depreciation (but plus real capital
gains), in income?

If we pay a housekeeper we create income
according to conventional measures. Should
we not record income, as well, if the work of
the housekeeper is done by an unpaid member
of the household?3 If we did, we would
note an enormous increase, in particular, in
the amount of income earned by women,
and consumed by men, women, and children.
We would also be forced to lower our
estimates of the increases in national income
as women leave unpaid household work for
jobs in the marketplace; we would have to
offset the increase in market earnings with
the reduction in the value of nonmarket output.


We might also alter our views of the presumed
decline in productivity growth. Average
labor productivity growth falls, in conventional
measures, as women entering the
labor force continue to fill disproportionately
lower-paying and hence less productive
jobs. But if the jobs they take, while less
productive than the average of those in the
labor force, are actually more productive
than unpaid jobs in the home, as appears
likely if only on the evidence that women do
take them, average total labor productivity
will be increased even as average market
labor productivity may be declining.4
Conventional measures of income include
various items that might better be excluded,
more appropriately viewed as expenses related
to work. If a firm arranges transportation
for its workers or if workers have to
travel in connection with their jobs we do
not include the cost of the transportation
services in income. But if workers have to
pay for their own commuting expense-as
most do-the portion of wages devoted to
this is counted as part of income.
We might include in consumption and income,
though, at least some of the value of
three-martini and other lunches and the variety
of amenities-fitness centers, club memberships,
vacation retreats, and conventions
combining as much play as work in exotic
locations-supplied in and out of corporate
offices. And we might impute income to capital
invested by government and impute output
to the value of services produced by this
capital. The value of public education, we
may note, is taken as the wages and salaries
paid to teachers and janitors. We do not
include, as we would if education were provided
by private business, any of capital
costs that would be measured by interest on
government debt, depreciation on buildings
and equipment or "profit."

We do include in gross national product
all of what we measure as government output.
Yet much of it is clearly intermediate in
character. If private firms are forced to hire
more security guards, the result is either no
change in national income or product if the
extra cost is taken out of profits, or an
increase in nominal but not real product if
prices rise. But if government hires more
police, nominal and real national income
and product increase. It may well be argued
3I am informed (by Lawrence Klein) that Norway
once proposed the inclusion of housewives' output in
national income and product and, for a time, estimated
it.

4I am indebted to Nancy Barrett for this point. See
Barrett and Ines Bustillo (1985).


### ---Economics-1989-0-06.txt---
that in both cases the security services are
merely inputs which should not be taken to
change our measure of final product. With
the massive increases in expenditures for national
defense in recent years-whether justifiable
or not-the implications for our
measures of growth in GNP are substantial.5
II. Deficits and National Saving
and Investment

Substantial as are the differences between
income as usually measured and its theoretical
construct, they are relatively small compared
to the departures of conventionally
measured saving and investment from their
theoretical counterparts.6 Personal saving,
the difference between disposable personal
income and outlays, of which the latter is
chiefly consumption, is immediately suspect
because of the measures of both income and
consumption, as is business or corporate saving
because of questionable measures of
costs, investment, and profits.7 But the problem
is much larger.

Investment is the acquisition or production
of capital, which in turn contributes to
current and future output. Should not the
production of new automobiles then qualify
as investment, whether they are bought by
business or by households or by government?
Should research expenses not be considered
investment along with expenditures
for plant and equipment? Are the education
and training of our young not perhaps the
most important investment in future productivity
that we can make?8 Yet we count such
private expenditures as consumption and the
vast if insufficient amount of output in the
form of public education is excluded from
investment under the apparently somewhat
pejorative heading of "government spending.
"

With gross income identically equal to
gross output, gross saving is identically equal
to gross investment, including increases in
net claims on the rest of the world, and net
saving is thus the claims on net additions to
capital. Saving should then include the portion
of income used to invest in the human
capital of a college education as well as the
portions used to buy corporate bonds or put
into a pension fund.

We have been bombarded for some time
with the arguments in political circles, but
also from many economists, utilizing data
from conventional measures and accounts,
that " national saving" is too low, disastrously
low. This so-called national saving is
the sum of the personal and corporate saving,
which we have had reason to question,
and government saving or the government
budget surplus.9 These measures are far from
the theoretical constructs to which we might
expect them to correspond.

First, since government budget surpluses
-or deficits-are taken as government receipts
minus all government outlays, without
distinguishing between current and capital


### ---Economics-1989-0-07.txt---
expenditures, a major adjustment is immediately
in order, consistent with the practice of
private business, to exclude the capital expenditures
and include in current outlays
only depreciation charges. Second, just as
not all of nominal interest receipts should be
included in income, not all of government
nominal interest payments should be counted
in outlays. Rather these should be adjusted
for the changing real value of government
debt, due both to inflation itself and the
changing market price of securities associated
with changing interest rates, which latter
may relate in part to changing rates of inflation.
We should in effect be including in
government revenues the inflation tax on the
private holders of government securities or
the money backed by central bank holdings
of those securities, or including in outlays
only real interest payments.'0
These two adjustments, for capital expenditures
and for inflation, make such a huge
difference in the Federal government budget
as to wipe out the much decried "budget
deficit."" The first of them has an identical
effect in raising our measure of national saving,
greatly depressed in its conventional
measure by the negative contribution of the
presumed fiscal dis-saving."

Gross saving is identically equal to gross
private domestic investment plus net foreign
investment. The supposed "twin deficit" in
the U.S. balance of trade or, more exactly,
the current account,"3 is the other side of the
coin of negative foreign investment, that is,
net acquisition by foreigners of claims on the
United States or its residents. If we measure
those claims incorrectly and hence measure
net foreign investment incorrectly, we correspondingly
mis-measure gross saving. By understating
gains in the value of our claims on
foreign assets, we understate business and,
to a certain extent, personal income and
saving.

But here again there is a major difference,
not noted by the public and politicians and,
I must add, not noted by most economists
either, between the official measures and
those that would correspond to meaningful
economic theory.'4 Particularly, direct investment
by U.S. firms abroad and by foreign
firms in the United States are both
taken at original cost. There is then no adjustment
for the changes in value of the
resulting assets in their own currencies or,
taking into account changing exchange rates,
the value of those changes in dollars.
Saving should correspond to increases in
wealth. National saving should correspond
to increases in national claims to wealth, at
home and abroad, net of increasing foreign
claims to domestic wealth. But to be meaningful,
these should surely relate to claims
measured in real, current, or market value.
In fact, they do not. Because they do not, we
have been confronted with repeated assertions
that the United States has become " the
world's greatest debtor nation," which is
"0It should be clear, of course, that this, meaningful
measure of real interest, which involves subtracting the
loss in the real value of debt due to inflation, cannot be
gotten by simply dividing nominal interest by a price
deflator. Deflators have rather to be applied to successive
nominal values of debt to calculate changes in its
real value. These changes are reflated to current prices
and subtracted from nominal interest payments. Alternatively,
the rate of inflation may be subtracted from
nominal rates of interest to calculate real rates of inter-
est which are in turn multiplied by the nominal value of
debt. This last measure, however, will not capture the
current gains or losses in the market value of debt
associated with changing expectations of future interest
rates.

" Using Office of Management and Budget data (U.S.
Government, 1988), I estimate the first adjustment, the
excess of federal investment expenditures over corresponding
capital consumption allowances, at about $70
billion. With an inflation rate of 3.6 percent and federal
debt held by the public at some $2,000 billion, the
second comes to another $72 billion. The federal budget
for fiscal 1988 is thus moved from its reported deficit of
$155 billion to a virtual balance!
12The second, inflation tax adjustment would also
reduce the measure of government dis-saving, or increase
government saving, but would correspondingly
decrease private saving or increase net foreign investment.
To the extent, because foreigners own some U.S.
government debt, our real obligations to the rest of the
world are reduced and properly measured net foreign
investment (as explained below) is increased, the inflation
tax adjustment also adds to gross saving.
'3Which adds to the trade deficit the net payments to
foreigners of property income, interest on government
debt, and transfers.

This despite some warning by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. See, in particular, Jack Bame (1985).

generally construed to be a national and
international calamity.

Calamity or not, despite the official figures
which, for the end of 1987, show a negative
"international position" of the United States
of $368 billion, in terms of theoretically
meaningful measures the assertions are simply
not true. The market values of direct
investment of the United States abroad, having
been undertaken generally in the more
distant past, have appreciated much more in
the currencies of the countries in which the
investment took place than has the dollar
value of foreign investment in the United
States. They have gained enormously more
in dollar value from the fall in dollar exchange
rates since early 1985. Further, the
official accounts take Treasury gold holdings,
which are viewed in effect as an offset
to foreign central bank holdings of dollars,
at its old "statutory" value of $42 an ounce,
roughly a tenth of its value at world market
prices. Adjustments for the value of direct
investment and the value of Treasury gold
have been more than sufficient to wipe out
the entire U.S. "debt" to the rest of the
world.'5

It may be argued, with some validity, that
whatever our current net creditor or net
debtor position, continued current account
deficits will increase U.S. liabilities relative
to assets regarding the rest of the world. But
with proper measures even this judgment
must be hedged. If continued current account
deficits are not financed by foreign
central bank intervention, the dollar is likely
to fall further. As it does, the dollar value of
U.S. assets abroad will rise. This suggests an
adjustment to our measure of the current
account deficit if we are to keep it identically
equal to a true capital account surplus that
measures the increase in the value of foreign
capital in the United States net of increases
in the value of U.S. capital in the rest of the
world.

In order of magnitude, the differences between
conventional measures and those
which might relate more closely to relevant
theoretical constructs are frequently major.
My own estimates for a comprehensive " total
incomes system of accounts" (TISA) put net
national product in 1981 at 30 percent more
than its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
counterpart,'6 and the contrast is even more
striking when we turn to investment. BEA's
real gross private domestic investment in
1981 was less than one quarter of TISA real
gross capital accumulation (exclusive of capital
gains). Where BEA net private domestic
investment was 5.5 percent of BEA net national
product, TISA net domestic capital
accumulation in current dollars was 19.5
percent of TISA net national product.
Similar proportions show up in the measures
of capital stocks. Business nonresidential
structures and equipment, to which so
much attention is usually given on the ground
of its purported contribution to productivity,
amounted to only 11 percent of total TISA
capital, intangible and tangible, land and
"reproducible," in all sectors-government,
households, and nonprofit, as well as business.
Government and government enterprise
structures and equipment came to 8
percent of the total, household durables and
residential capital to 13 percent, and the
intangible capital of R&D, education, training,
and health to no less than 48 percent.'7

may or may not look strikingly different
from the pictures presented of narrower bodies
of data. It may indeed be hard to know
until we have the fruits of some redirection
of economic research. But is it not clearly
these broader, conceptually relevant measures
on which we should be focusing in
analysis, evaluation, and the determination
of public policy?

III. New Behavioral Relations, Theory
and Policy

All of this is not just a matter of changing
the numbers we associate with familiar variables.
Rather, it alters old relations and reveals
important new ones. Take the wellknown
loglinear production function, for example.
In its most common Cobb-Douglas
form, we are accustomed to relating output
to private "capital" and "labor." David
Aschauer (1988) reports significant contributions
to private output from government infrastructure
capital. I have added arguments
for R&D and human capital and found both
significantly positive while the coefficient of
tangible capital is sharply negative.'8 I am
hardly ready to claim on the basis of these
single-equation estimates that more tangible
capital will generally reduce output, and take
my results with some reserve, but I suggest
that a broader view of capital would give
pause to enthusiastic advocates of business
investment tax credits and other "incentives"
of this genre.

Revision of the traditional consumption
function indicates that, along with the expected
coefficient in the neighborhood of .9
for labor income after taxes, we get a (too
high, admittedly) coefficient of about .3 for
the real net debt of the government and .06
for tangible capital. (Household tangible
capital, perhaps a proxy for permanent income,
has a coefficient of about .2.) Working
with investment functions, I find that the
acceleration principle explains much of business
investment in structures and equipment.
But increases in market output do not appear
to have generated subsequent accumulation
of the much larger amounts of other
capital which seem to have so much to do
with total output and productivity.
Measures of investment closer to their theoretical
construct would throw light on some
of the limitations of "q-theory," which purports
to relate business capital expenditures
to the ratio, q, of the market value of the
firm to the replacement cost of its "capital.
" When that ratio is high, it is presumed
that firms will sell shares or otherwise see fit
to raise funds to add to their fixed capital.
When q is low, it will rather pay to buy fixed
capital by buying other firms or simply to
use funds to buy back outstanding stock
rather than buy more expensive physical assets.


But does not this theory relate very largely
to a view of dichotomous labor and "capital"
as the factors of production? In truth, firms
invest much in the experience, skills, and
dedication of their labor, which then constitute
an important component of capital
value. Much of the value of the firm constituting
the numerator of the q-ratio is determined
by TISA components of capital that
do not enter into its replacement-cost denominator.
To the extent these were substitutes
for conventionally included capital,
they might even bring about a negative relation
between the conventional measures of
business investment and q. If all capital were
included, the values of q would likely be
vastly different and critical divergences between
average and marginal q exposed. The
remoteness of the relevance of a comprehensive
q to investment in the small spectrum
of business plant and equipment would
become clear, and with that an explanation
of some of the well-known difficulties in
empirical implementation of the q-theory
approach.19

18See Eisner (1989), Table D.I.
19Further difficulties in giving flesh to investment
and production theory may well stem from problems in
getting sound measures of real output. These depend
considerably on the quality of our price deflators, too
often-despite warnings from the BEA of the need for
further work on a number of problems, including measure
of quality change, weighting, and import and input
prices-taken for granted. If, as there is good ground to
suspect, they have frequently overstated price inflation
while correspondingly understating quality improveOne


### ---Economics-1989-0-10.txt---
of the more egregious examples of
misplaced concreteness of theoretical concepts
involves the role of "money" in many
recent macroeconomic models. The "money"
of the models is frequently a pure-breed of
uniquely perfectly liquid cash. It is somehow
increased or decreased by the government or
monetary authority without changes in the
quantities of other assets. Some theorists then
find that in certain ideal types of costlessinformation,
perfectly competitive, priceflexible,
market-clearing economies, changes
in the quantity of money have no real effects
and merely bring proportionate changes in
prices.20 Then, to my astonishment, some of
our colleagues derive implications for the
optimal paths of M-1 or M-2 or "monetary
policy."

That the various monetary aggregates
which enter into our empirical formulations
are heterogeneous collections of frequently
endogenous elements in a broad spectrum of
financial assets and liabilities seems, in some
quarters at least, frequently to escape attention.
The theoretical concept of assets of
"outside," government money is a far cry
from the multitide of largely private instruments
that enter into transactions and
wealth. To the extent that these are or can be
readily quantified, they are a poor fit indeed
to the money of much economic theory and
the relations in which it is embodied.
While monetary policy is bedeviled by
confusion with regard to measures and variables
of analysis, fiscal policy is one big
mess. And confusion here has contributed
mightily to misdirection in macroeconomic
theory and policy.

As I have pointed out elsewhere,2' motivation
for the macroeconomic, rational expectations
revolution, or counterrevolution,
stemmed at least in part from the perception,
as so attributed by Robert Lucas and
Thomas Sargent, that "massive government
budget deficits and high rates of monetary
expansion" in the 1970s were accompanied
not by the decreasing unemployment predicted
by Keynes, but by growing unemployment
and growing inflation.22 I have already
alluded to problems with measures of "money.
" The measured "massive budget deficits"
observed by Lucas and Sargent, and by so
many others, were simply not the deficits of
meaningful economic theory.

The significance of a deficit, any deficit, is
that it adds to net debt. When any agent
spends more than its income it must borrow
or sell off assets. When government runs a
deficit it must therefore add to private assets,
either in the form of holdings of government
debt or the assets government has liquidated.
It is this increase in private assets that, even
more clearly in neoclassical than Keynesian
theory, as noted many years ago by Gottfried
Haberler (1941), A. C. Pigou (1943,
1947), and Don Patinkin (1948, 1951, and
1965), induces an increase in private spending.


To have this effect, as the neoclassical
argument made clear, the increase in private
assets must be real. But if the government
"deficit" is accompanied by substantial and
rising inflation, the real, market value of
outstanding government debt may well decline
more than the amount of the nominal
deficit. In that case, those alleged deficits
become real surpluses, which economic theory,
Keynesian and neoclassical alike, indicate
should be a depressant to consumption
and, unless one has inordinate faith that
goods markets always clear, to real aggregate
demand and output.

That is exactly what happened in the late
1970s. The cumulative total of $153 billion
of nominal deficits in the Carter years, from
1977 to 1980, were real surpluses totaling
$72 billion. 24 The federal budget did not

move to significant real deficit until well into
1982. Should any theorist-or policymaker
-have been surprised that the economy evidenced
mounting unemployment leading up
to the mini-recession of 1980? Or should
they have been surprised that, with the addition
of very restrictive monetary policy, imposed
as " the only game in town" to combat
inflation given the supposed fiscal stimulus,
this led on to the deep recession of 1982?
Had appropriate measures been used to
illuminate previous policy, we might have
been better prepared to see the predictable
consequences of the very large real deficits
inaugurated in the latter half of 1982. We
might then have been all the more incredulous
of those who perceived a recovery from
the trough of a "real business cycle." 25 Who
indeed can really believe that the 12 million
new jobs, about which some have boasted,
were those of otherwise idle workers lured
by higher real wages-brought on, shall we
say, by lower oil prices or higher marginal
products stemming from sweeping new productivity
gains? Rather, it should have been
clear-dare I say "perfectly clear"?-that it
was the old-fashioned Keynesian stimulus of
real budget deficits that has contributed
mightily to cutting unemployment in half,
from its recession high of almost 11 percent.
There should indeed be some consternation
among those who find the current 5.3
percent unemployment as much as a full
percentage point below their misnamed
"natural" rate. Where, I might add, is that
supposedly excess-demand "accelerating inflation"
we were taught to fear? Perhaps
waiting to be confused again with the supply
shocks of a new war or oil cartel in the
Middle East!

IV. Provision for the Future: The Case
of Social Security

There is a perennial, legitimate concern in
any nation, and certainly in our mixed economy,
as to the allocation of resources to the
joys of today and the needs of tomorrow. It
is widely argued, however much, as I have
suggested, on the basis of improper measures,
that our presumed budget and trade
deficits will tarnish our golden years or contribute
undue and possibly unsustainable
burdens to our children and grandchildren.
Flowing from this argument have been a
number of proposals of new accounting for
our vast Social Security system. However
well-intentioned, they threaten to make our
fiscal mess all the worse.

There have, on the one hand, been suggestions
that we bring our huge "contingent
liabilities" into the general federal accounting
framework. We would, for example, include
the present value of expected payouts
to future retirees, net of their expected "contributions"
or tax payments, as federal debt.
Increases in this net debt would then add to
our measure of the deficit; decreases would
reduce it. At first glance, this would seem
sound. The budget would be truly "unified."
But would debt and deficits so measured
really match our theoretical constructs? Can
we expect agents to react in the same fashion
to uncertain and currently illiquid potential
receipts decades in the future as they would
to liquid current cash or Treasury bills? Must
we not recognize that few have any idea
what their Social Security benefits will be, or
what taxes they can expect to pay before
they receive them, whatever is written into
present, and very changeable legislation? Are
Martin Feldstein's changing estimates of net
Social Security wealth (1974, 1982) robust
arguments of anybody's consumption function?
26

In principle, contingent and uncertain liabilities
and assets should be taken into account
in macroeconomic analysis. My objection
to confusing them with the already
mis-measured components of the current
budget should not be taken to deny this. The
move in the opposite direction, though, to
declare Social Security trust funds "off budget"
and then ignore them in determining
appropriate fiscal policy is treacherous. Some
advise us now, for example, that a "balanced"
overall budget, despite the infirmities
I have pointed out in that measure, is not
25As it may be defined by E. C. Prescott (1986) and
others who have developed the concept.
26For a negative view on this see, among others,
Eisner (1983).


### ---Economics-1989-0-12.txt---
enough. We must rather balance the " budget"
exclusive of Social Security trust funds.
These latter will be showing increasing surpluses
over the years ahead until, by moderate
estimate, they will in the year 2030 attain
a total accumulation of $12 trillion. From
that point they would presumably be drained
down to support the final declining years of
the baby boomers of a few decades ago.
Is the fiction of putting what the government
collects from the public in a different
pot likely to prevent serious deflationary
consequences of years of major real budget
surpluses? Or would the equal fiction that
they are not federal spending avoid the inflationary
consequences of large payouts in
excess of revenues half a century from now?
Fiscal policy based on such measures can
indeed create havoc.

This is all the more so because of the
interaction of these faulty proposed measures
and others that I have cited. Provision
of generous real support to large cohorts of
future retirees by reduced cohorts of those
working may well prove a problem. Aside
from having more people working and fewer
retired, it can only be met by raising the
productivity of those working. That may be
accomplished in part by increasing their endowment
of business plant and equipment,
which dominates conventional measures of
investment, although it may be doubted that
much of current business capital expenditures
will have much directly to do with
productivity in 2030.27

I may add that neither good (Keynesian!)
theory nor empirical evidence suggests that
budget surpluses and reduced consumption
are likely to contribute to more business
investment of any kind. To be confident that
they would, one would have to believe that
the reductions in interest rates that they
might generate would increase investment
demand more than the reductions in consumption
and output would decrease it. The
reasons for doubt are of course to be found
in John M. Keynes, and their formal theoretical
formulation in Oscar Lange's (1938), (I
hope not forgotten) distinguished article of
half a century ago on the "Optimal Propensity
to Consume." Some decades of work on
investment functions and the role of output
and accelerator effects versus that of interest
rates and costs of capital, to which I confess
to having contributed my share,28 would
seem to offer ample empirical support for
that doubt.

But fuller and more appropriate measures
of investment and productivity might make
clear that the best and perhaps the only
feasible way to provide the sustenance of our
future aged is to develop our public, social
infrastructure and endow our young with all
of the education, training, research output,
and good health that our society is capable
of offering. One or two more generations
with large proportions of illiterates and
semiliterates will hardly produce a labor
force adequately equipped for productive
employment in the 21st century. This suggests
to me that the Social Security surpluses
should be invested in education and training,
research and development, public health, and
the public infrastructure which is the necessary
foundation for private production. If we
had federal budget and national accounting
measures that properly classified all of this
vital capital accumulation, the choice of wise
public policy, and the economic analysis on
which it would build, might be much easier.
V. Conclusion

Economic science can boast of many advances
over the years. Too many sins of
policymakers have been falsely attributed to
a profession whose counsel has too frequently
been compromised or ignored. I am
fond, to illustrate, of comparing the challenge
to prescribe a (painless?) cure for inflation
to the cry of the patient who comes to
the doctor complaining of myriad ills and
says "Doc! Make me well, but don't tell me
to exercise, lose the hundred pounds that I


### ---Economics-1989-0-13.txt---
am overweight, cut down my drinking, or
quit smoking." We cannot very easily cure
inflation if we are told that we cannot touch
import quotas and tariffs, price supports, a
variety of entrenched monopolies and anticompetitive
and other costly regulative interventions
in the economy. But we can pride
ourselves on rigorous application of our often
finely honed tools of analysis and our
ability to offer sound policy advice, whether
it is followed or not.

So I would not want my remarks this
evening to be taken as a mea culpa, for
myself or for our profession. But we are not
perfect, and I have endeavored to alert
us-or recall our attention to-certain critical
failings that keep us further from perfection
than we should be.

I have hence noted some pitfalls in using
current and past variables in analyses that
depend critically upon expectations of the
future. I have warned of confusion in employing
narrowly defined measures of income
and product in evaluating flows and
trends in comprehensive earnings and output.
I have argued that particularly large
dangers abound in basing policy on conventional
measures of private and public saving,
investment and capital. I have suggested that
usual estimates of some of the critical behavioral
relations of macroeconomics may be
suspect because of a failure to match theoretical
constructs with appropriate empirical
counterparts.

Very generally, I conclude, it is important
in economics-as elsewhere-to know what
we are talking about.29

29I should not close without suggesting that of complimentary
importance is having the data to talk about.
At the risk of increasing that budget deficit, however we
measure it (or reducing the surplus), it would seem
appropriate, in line with the report of the American
Economic Association Committee on Federal Statistics
(see Thomas Juster, 1988), to give the BEA and other
statistical agencies the resources to develop more of the
measures appropriate for economic analysis.
