corporations. I would develop, in a word, so far as
possible the practical as well as the theoretical sides of
insurance, banking and similar departments of industry.
I Snd, among others, the foliowillg sul:jects already
offered in the curricula established in these new departnellts:
economic geography, history of coml-nerce, business
organization and management, commercial law,
transpol-tatioll, money and banking, materials of commerce,
contracts, personal property, tlleol-y of accounts,
auditing, insurance, statistics, corporation finance.
I need not here go into ally further detail; I desire
oally to emphasize the fact that in my opinion any curriculum
for higher commercial education which does
ot give reasonable attelltiol-l to what might be called
the practical aspects of business life will not accomplish
the best results.

I am not only in favor of the universities undertalillg
this function of providing lligl1er education for business
men, but I am in favor of plltti21g these elements into
such a shape that a rollllg mall can feel that he is following
Out a s;57stel-Ilatic course of study while plll-SUillg
it. I believe also that the university should announce
in a definite form that it proposes to offer a curriculum
for the benefit of those men expectiIlg to go into business,
exactly as it announces tl1at it l1as a law scl1ool
or a medical scl1ool. I make this statement because
sorlle of our universities, which have ilg the wide range
of their elective studies a g,reat many of these eleluents
svl1icll I have l-llentiolaecl, refuse to regard it as desirable
to add the other subjects which I have suagested, or
to call attention to the fact that they ofier facilities which
would be worth the while of oung men to take ad-
07alltage of, before entering upon their active business
liv es.
