As a result of the nature of lzaan, of the conditions of
existence in a srorlcl like ours, and of the great llistol-ical
institutions which have come down to llS, men exist in
classes. These classes, in modern times, rest upon all
economic foundation. Even the political classes of
earlier clays had, in the beginning, an economic basis,

class as follows: " An order of or rank of persons;

pl-operty, occupation, habits of life.'9
The existence of classes, which is absolutely necessarr,

man to control, gives complexity to our problem of
liberty. A modern jllrist has used these words, which
have a pro-found significance in our discussion of the
problem of liberty: " There is no greater inequality tha
the equal treatment of unequals."

The problem of liberty includes the problem of suitable
control over the relations which exist along men; for
these relations determine the conditions of our social existence.
These relations may be considered individually
and socially, and the social action may be either of private
or public character. The action of a trades union in its
endeavor to secure favorable relations, is private social
action; a statute, determining the length of the srorki ng
day, is public social action; and lDotll alike aim, successfully
or unsuccessfully as the case may be, to promote
liberty. All action whicl-l endeavors to l-emove ignorance
and superstition and to strengthen the individual,
mentally, morally and physically, is action which endeavors
