believe in colupetition must, in order to secure the CO11-

activity in matters of irrig-atioll.
I retret that I call clo I10 lI]Ore llel-t aIlCl llOlV mall
nerely to allude to t;wo somewhat a ntagol-listic lines of
evolution. One is the Ilaovelnellt which approaclleswi
mont hope of evel reaclli llg-l-eal equa] i ty of oplDorttlnities
in economic competition. This is one of the
l-nost porelful lllovelnelltvs of the century just drawing
to a close allci must be borne clearly in mind by any
one who would understand the great llistol-ical move
nlents of that centl1ry. The other line of clerelolDnlent
is found in the construction of great institlltiolas wllid-l
shut in and limit colnpetitio-l, T)llt oTllicll nevertheless
are the very foundations upon Nallicll our civilization
rests; the institutions \0Jllicll may be likened to social
savings balllSs or de?ositories of l-ace-achievements. I
have l-lere in mind the t,-reat ecollollaicÂ°jtlriclical instittl
tiOllS of society, such as private property, inheritance of
property and vested interests. The probressive appl
oxilllation to equality in opportunities must not be
perlxrlitted to bo so far as to ul-ldel-ll-line these illStitUtiOI-S.
In the lnul;ual adjustments of these two lines of evolution,
namely, the equality of opporCtlnity movement
and the institutional movements, nre have given us one
of the weit,lltiest atld at the same time most delicate
tasks of the twentieth century.
Cozupetition thus conceived is beneficent! and the
competitive order rightly controlled by society furllishes
to tnen the maximum of pleasure with a minimum of
pain. Not only does it insure progress for the race, lDllt
to an increasing extelat all lnen participate in the benes
fits of this progress. \Ale have ilO evidence that tl-le
colupetitive order is ultra-rational, and still less need
we believe that it is anti-rational, as Mr. ILidd asserts,
