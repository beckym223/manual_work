oppoz-tunities for the acquisition of a livelihood by the
mass of men, in order that back of contracts there may
lie a nearer approximation to equalitlyir of strent,-th on
the part of the two contracting parties. It is certain
that tlltre \\7ill be a vast development along this iine
during the twentieth century, and tllrou5-ll this development
we shall find liberty expressing itself increasingly
through contl-act.
