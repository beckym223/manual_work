probletus two thousand years ago. But I have faitil to
believe that this is not the fate marked out for us to-day.
I believe that the Alzlericall people and the modern civilized
world in general will solve these probletus, as they
have solved other problems which have come up iul the
successive phases of their history; that we shall meet
the new collective 1leecls of indllstry and goverlllllent
with a true collectivisIn of spirit and purpose. Not
with that superEcial collectivism or socialism which,
like the individualism that it strives to supersede, often
allalces too much of mere political machinery, and believes
that mel] are to be saved by their institutions
rather than their cllaracters; but with a public spirit
which detnallds, as a part of the national ethics, that
lnen shall shape their course on the basis of COllViCtiOll
rather thala of colllpromise, and that public discussion
shall look toward a commoIl ullclerstalldillg rather than
a bargaill. Because the political aled colllonercial Illethods
of the past have led to coillproulise rather than conViCtiOll,
or because the successflll lllan of affairs must be
read^T to compromise where he fails to convince, let us
not say that all politics and all commerce is but a tissue
of compromises, and that a political or commercial
science which pretends to be something broader and
better than this, is all illusion. Let us as ecollomists
take the opportunity that lies lDefore us, in the face of
new collditiolls for whose treatmellt the old methods are
plOVillg themselves inadequate. Let us employ our Ullw
derstallding with regard to public lleecls as a lllealls of
evokillg public spirit. Let us use svllatever special
kllowledge we have with all the breadtll of ptlrpose
which it is in our power to attain, aold make ourselves,
as becomes lnen of science, representatives of llotlling
less than the whole truth.
