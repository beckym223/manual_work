thus opened for the school, though the two-year curriculum, which
was open to students upon the coulpletion of the first two years in
co]lege, was retained.
01Vhen Albert S. Bones accepted a position in the State govertllalellt
at Harrisburg, Edmund J. Jatnes was entrusted xvith the practical administration
of the school, and later ap?ointed Director. For admission
to the cul-ricllluin, noser lengthened from two to four years, ssrere
demanded in general the same requisites as for the classical or technical
colleges. Many new courses +rere added, with a result of
strengthening and establis'ning the department more firmiy. Instrlletors
rvere appointed in the theory and practice of accounting,
transportation, banking, journalism, and other pl-actical subjects,
besides additional instructors in economics and politics. The fouryear
plan thus adopted by the NVhartoll School ilas lgeell accepted, as
indicated in the text, by most of OU1' institutions whid-l have undertaken
this xvork. As all evidence of the demand for this kind of instrtletion,
the fact may lDe stated, that while the \Alhartoll School
course is oIle of a large number of elective courses offered in the IJniversity
of Pennsylvania, it has a greater attendance than the average
of the courses. The follonvillg table shows the attendance from r895

As indicative of the interest which the new departments have
created, the follovv7ing statement made lDy Professor William A. Scott,
Director of the new School of Commerce in the University of NVisconSill,
iS of interest:

" Highty-four students have registered in our School of Commerce
up to date. Of these, 6I are freshlmen, I7 sophomores, 3 juniors, and
3 specials. Of this total, 65 have come to the Univel-sity for the first
time this year, and I9 have transferred from some other courses in
the University. In order to find out exactly what proportion of the
students would have come to the University had not the School of
Commerce lDeen established, I sent a circular letter to each one aslzing
the three following questions:
I. NVould you have come to this University if the School of Commerce
had not been established ?
2. NVould you have gone to some other university if the School of
Commerce had not been established ?
