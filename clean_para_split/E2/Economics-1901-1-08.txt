Tlais argument has, however, a certain practical weight
and is llearcR most often, perhaps, al:llong business men
thetnselves. It is, llowes7er, the satne old objection rhicll
has been raised at,ain.st higher eclucatioll in every clepartrnellt,
viz.: that young men sllould begin with the
A, B, C, of the business or professioll in practical life
rather than svaste tlaeir time on tlleoretical courses in
college. The old-fashioned svay to study meclicine was
to begin by harnessitlg up the doctor's llorse, as he preparecT
to go his rounds, following this up by takirlg
medicille to the patiellts, and vasllillg and cleallillg the
mortars and pestles used in their preparation. The lawyer
began by eopying papers, and the nlercllatlt by
sweeping Ollt the snop; the book-lDinclillg apprentice, b),r
waslling the dinner clishes for tl-le housewife, etc. But
this idea has alreadr been g-ivell up iu the case of cel--
tain itllportant callings, and tnust gradually disappear in
the case of tnany others.l
As to the secoold pOillt, tl-lere is llncloubtedly sozne
danger that the young well wl-lo spelld from seven to
eight years in the study of Ivatin, Greek and matllematics,
(>r even in the study of Frencll and Gertlan, and llatural
science, may acquire, if not a taste for literary callings, at
least a distaste for mercantile life. But this cloes not t,)rove
that the pursuit of a llighel- course of study, which sl-loulcR
be related more closely to their future xvork w0111d have
the same effect. The study of the history and methods
of insurance, for example, in all their different aspects,
need not of itself destroy all interest of young
men in the business of insurance as a practical career;
on the contrary, it would very probalDly inerease the
lC:f. no. II in the list of monographs, etc., on commelcial education
appended to this paper.
