    "In this notebook, you will be performing some text cleaning functions on a collection of documents that we identified as having similar formats. The goal of this is to clean up some of the fluff around the edges and have only the body text. We want to get rid of headers, footers, pictures, reference pages, and the like. Since these are grouped by formatting, we would hope to be able to apply text cleaning functions to the whole directory."
