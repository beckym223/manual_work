One is the progressive eharaeter of the state,
^.1. to general enlightenment; another is the altrllistie
.pxrit of the age, wliiell finds suell oSratifyillg expressio
the Old Bay state, and a third is the faet of its lligl
dustrial development, as a result of which it has had
3 r deal for a longer period than other states ritll those
questions growing out of an intensive industrial life.
Reeently, howeer, to states, viz., Tennessee ala(t West
Virginia, itldustriallwr far less developed, have taken a
leading po.sition in the regulation of eontraet in the
interests of libertz truly eoneeived. I refer to the
deeisions of the eourts of these states, sustaining statutes
prohibiting the lnaintellallee of trllek shops, and also
providing for weighing of eoal. the eourts elearly
reeognize inequalities in baraainillg porer, 157ilag baek
of eontraet, and they also take the pOSitiOzz,-ancR it is undoubtedly
a true one,-that wise legislation of this sort is
ealeulated to prevent industrial strife, disorder and
bloodshed, and to maintain the publie peaee.l
The au,ust tribunal whieh holds its session in this
eity, the Supreme Court of the United States, has also,
OI1 broad grounds of publie policy, 1lpllelcl the statute of
the state of Utah, wllieh limits the x^Torking day Â£or
miners in that state to eight hours.2 TIle Supreme
Court did not go into the wisdom of this partietllar
statute, and I have no desire to clo so ola this oceasiool.
It is simply the broad prineiple of regulation of eeollomie
relations in the interests of freedom mich is in
question. We see the most enlightened eourts thus enmists
and sociologists are the people to sTholll sve ought to turIl more
than ve do for instruction in the grounds and foundations of all
rational decisions."
