compromise in which the interests of the part which
they represent shall have adequate recoanitioll. This
substitution of compromise for conviction as the ideal
of legislative activity is perhaps the oreatest and most
pervasive evil ulader which our political machinery
suffers. It shows its effect in the demoralizing principle

spite of all protests, has come to be gelzerally accepted
in practical politics. It deprives the member of the
legislature of the educational influence incident to his
position. It makes him an agent not only of his district,
but of his party within his district. It manifests
its results in appropriation bills, where the Inembers
who stand up for the general interest of the treasury are
increasingly rare, and those who luake claims for the
expenditure of money on behalf of their localities and
often on behalf of private interests within their localities
become constantly louder. It shows itself even in
general legislation, where the character of modern
statutes as a patchwork of private demands has become
only too notorious.
All this has gone so far as to produce a change in the
public estimate of parliamentary bodies. The glorificatioll
