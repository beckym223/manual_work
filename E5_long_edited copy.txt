In 1940, output per man-hour in American nonagricultural industries
was roughly double that of 1920. In few periods of history has capacity
to produce goods grown more rapidly than in the last twenty years. The
industrial research staffs of American business in 1940 were nine times
as large as in 1920, and so also were expenditures on research. At no
time in the country's history had its capacity to increase production
been so great. And yet the community which possessed this unparalleled
productive capacity to improve methods and products did not glory in
its strength. It was perplexed and baffled. Instead of looking forward
confidently to achieving ever rising standards of living, it dreaded the
future. It asked whether investment opportunities were becoming per-
manently insufficient, whether the rules for achieving prosperity were
undergoing fundamental changes, whether new conditions were making
its economic institutions no longer workable.
This sense of doubt and inadequacy did not exist, in the United States
at least, before 1929. It was created by the depression and by the dis-
appointing recovery. The great national effort required by the war may
prove to be precisely what is needed to restore the country's faith in its
capacity to master great problems. Nevertheless, the task of winning
the peace requires that we face frankly the questions raised by the de-
pression and the disappointing recovery. Is it true that new conditions-
the decline in geographical expansion, the drop in population growth,
shifts in economic and political power, and changes in public policy-
are radically altering the problem of maintaining employment, so that
plans for the post-war world must envisage important changes in policies
and institutions? The thesis of these remarks is that the answer to this
question is a qualified Yes.

Since the questions under consideration were first raised in this
country by the disappointing recovery from the depression, it is con-
venient to begin our survey by a brief examination of some of the
circumstances affecting recovery.
Whatever may be the ultimate effects of the decline in geographical
expansion or the drop in the growth of population, neither of these
influences appears to explain the depression or the disappointing re-
covery. Of course, it would have helped had there been another Missis-
sippi Valley to develop. But no sudden change occurred in the state of
our natural resources between the twenties and the thirties. Further-
more, older and more developed countries experienced a milder depres-
sion and recovered more completely.2 As for the spectacular drop in the
rate of population growth between the twenties and the thirties, evidence
is lacking that it produced either an unfavorable shift in the consump-
tion function or an unfavorable change in the slope of the function.
Indeed, the number of non-employed persons per member of the work-
ing force has shown no appreciable, change in forty years.3 The possi-
bility that drop in the population growth might have retarded expansion
by limiting the opportunity to widen capital is excluded partly by the fact
that the increase in the number of families dropped only slightly, and
partly by the large and persistent unemployment which characterized
the period. As far as the labor supply was concerned, ample opportunity
to widen capital existed.
III
To a considerable extent the depression and the unsatisfactory re-
covery are explained by conditions which do not reflect permanent
changes in the economic environment. Failure of banks was probably
the most important single influence in making the depression more
severe in the United States than in most other countries. No one would
contend, however, that the vulnerability of our banking system to
depression was a necessary or permanent condition. The very severity
of the depression and the bank failures which accompanied it were them-
selves major impediments to recovery. Consider their effect in diminish-
ing the fortunes of thousands of local capitalists and in making these
men reluctant to risk the remainder of their resources. Small local
2By 1936, when 20 out of 23 countries reporting industrial production to the League
of Nations had surpassed the output of 1929, industrial production in the United
States was still 7 per cent below 1929. This country was in twenty-first place out of
23 countries in recovery from 1929. The industrial production in the United Kingdom
in 1936 was 15.8 per cent above 1929; in Sweden, 35.0 per cent; in Finland, 39.0 per
cent; in Denmark, 30.0 per cent; in Hungary, 18.4 per cent.

capitalists have always been an important dynamic influence in the
economy.4 The bank failures and other special circumstances were also
largely responsible for the great amount of distress housing which hung
over the market until 1937. This prolonged the depression in residential
building long after the rest of the economy had revived. In the absence
4Some indirect evidence of the effect of the depression upon local capitalists is
provided by the income tax returns. For example, if one compares the volume of income
after taxes in 1931 and 1935, two years in which the national income was about 55
billion dollars, one finds that incomes of $25,000 or more in the former year totaled
1.9 billion dollars, and in the latter, 1.5 billion dollars, or 21.9 per cent less. (Imre de
Vegh, "Savings, Investment, and Consumption," Am. Econ. Rev., Suppl., vol. xxx,
Feb., 1941, p. 238.) These figures do not allow for capital gains and losses. Since the
year 1931 was one in which capital losses were large, the realized incomes of over
$25,000 before capital losses in 1931 were undoubtedly considerably more than 1.9 billion
dollars.
An impediment to recovery after 1933 that has been neglected is the scarcity of
business savings. The principal source of venture capital always has been the plowed-back
earnings of business enterprises. These have always been the spearhead of expansion, the
prerequisite for drawing in funds from the outside. Although individual corporations
were able to save, corporations as a whole had no savings in the entire period from 1929 to
1939. And between 1935 and 1938, dividend disbursements exceeded earnings by a billion a  year.
Corporations failed to save in the main because during the twenties they had
established high dividend rates which they were attempting to restore. The disburse-
ments of dividends were encouraged in 1936 and 1937 by the undistributed profits tax.
Of course, enterprises had depreciation allowances, but there were severe demands upon
these because of the postponed maintenance from the worst years of the depression.
Even when allowance is made for funds from depreciation allowances, the amounts
available for reinvestment by corporations in 1935 and 1936 were far smaller than in
1923, when the national income was comparable in amount. In 1923, undistributed
profits and depreciation of non-financial corporations were 5.3 billion dollars. In 1935
and 1936, undistributed profits, depreciation, and depletion were $2.0 billions and
$2.7 billions respectively. (T.N.E.C., Hearings, Part 9, "Savings and Investment," p.
4039, Exhibit 582.)
An important aspect of plowed-back earnings is that they are venture capital. They
increase the equity of the business owners. Plowed-back earnings must be regarded as an
even more important dynamic influence than the investments of the well-to-do. In the five
years, 1922 to 1927, for example, business savings were 13.4 billion dollars. (S. Kuznets,
National Income and Capital Formation, 1919-1935, p. 24.) Income of persons receiving
more than $25,000 a year (after the payment of federal income taxes) in the same
period was 21.9 billion dollars. (Imre de Vegh, loc. cit.) If we assume that half of the
incomes above $25,000 were saved, the investment-seeking funds from this source in
the period 1922 to 1927, were not quite 11 billion dollars.
Many economists have regarded business savings as a deflationary influence. In
periods of contraction they probably are. The view that they are always a deflationary
influence overlooks the fact that expansion begins with the plowing back of earnings.
This is a preliminary step to getting outside capital. This is why business savings con-
stitute the spearhead of expansion. In order to judge the full effect of plowing back of
earnings, one must allow for its contagious effect. An expansion or improvement by one
competitor compels rivals to make investment in an attempt to hold their position. This
involves a "multiplier" which is different from the consumption multiplier used by
Keynes. The Keynesian multiplier is based upon the amount of additional consumption
which will be induced by a given expansion of investment. The investment multiplier indi-
cates the additional investment that will be directly induced by a given expansion of
investment.

of this distress housing, building construction in the period 1934 to
1937 would undoubtedly have been two to three times the rate which
prevailed. Since housing has always been the most important single out-
let for investment-seeking funds, the persistence of the depression in
housing was a main deterrent to recovery.5
But conditions of a more permanent nature have influenced the re-
covery. The depression produced, or at least greatly accelerated, shifts
in economic and political power which are likely to be permanent and
it enormously stimulated the making of economic policy by the govern-
ment. These shifts in power and changes in public policy not only
affected recovery from the depression, but altered the long-run problem
of giving employment. It is important to examine their influence.
IV
On the whole, the shift in economic and political power impeded re-
covery. It did this in three principal ways. In the first place, the very
fact that a great shift in power was going on created uncertainty con-
cerning the long-term yield on capital and hence created an abnormal
preference for short-term production plans. In this way, uncertainty
narrowed investment opportunity and reduced temporarily the marginal
return on capital.6
In the second place, the shift in economic power altered in many
plants the control of managements over labor costs and increased the
difficulty of converting a rise of output into profits. It is instructive to
compare the revival of profits after 1934 with the revival after 1921-
two years in which national income was about 50 billion dollars. In
1921, non-financial corporations had a deficit of 355 million dollars,
in contrast with a profit of 884 million dollars in 1934. Between 1921
and 1923, a rise of the national income of 17.2 billion dollars to a level
of 70 billion dollars produced a 5.5 billion-dollar gain in the profits of
non-financial corporations. Between 1934 and 1937, a slightly larger


---Economics-1942-0-05.txt---
rise in the national income (21.1 billion dollars) to a level of 71.4 billion
dollars produced a gain of 3 billion dollars in profits. When profits come
hard, the disposition to venture is weak.
The lesser success of enterprises in converting a rise of business into
profits after 1933 than after 1921 is explained by a variety of circum-
stances, but very largely by the movements of labor efficiency and
wages. Physical productivity per man-hour grew twice as fast after 1921
as after 1933 or 1934, but wage rates went up twice as rapidly in the
second period as in the first. These differences were not entirely com-
pensated by price movements.7
V
During the period when shifts in economic power and public policy
substantially reduced the attractiveness of long-range plans, government
fiscal policy was developing in ways that greatly reduced the marginal
efficiency of capital and especially diminished the attractiveness of ven-
tures involving considerable uncertainty and risk. To begin with, a large
deficit in the regular budget persisted undiminished, except for one year,
"Between 1921 and 1923, man-hour productivity in manufacturing increased 3.06 per
cent per year as against 2.0 per cent between 1934 and 1937. In mineral industries it
increased 7.1 per cent a year in the first period and 5.0 per cent in the second; in
railroading, 4.3 per cent in the first period, and 3.8 per cent in the second. (S. Bell,
Productivity, Wages, and National Income, pp. 269, 27 1, 274.) Hourly earnings in
manufacturing increased 3.2 per cent between 1921 and 1923, according to the
National Industrial Conference Board. Between 1934 and 1937, hourly earnings in
manufacturing increased 15.7 per cent according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
and 19.6 per cent according to the National Industrial Conference Board.
In some respects it is more satisfactory to compare the period 1921 to 1926 with the
period 1933 to 1937. In the first period man-hour productivity in manufacturing increased
4.3 per cent a year as against 1.7 per cent in the second; in the mineral industries, it
increased 8.0 per cent a year in the first period and 3.7 per cent in the second; in
railroading, it increased 3.3 per cent per year in the first period and 3.0 per cent in
the second. Between 1921 and 1926, hourly earnings in manufactuiring rose 8.4 per cent;
between 1933 and 1937, 40 per cent.
In the case of electric light and power, productivity per man-hour apparently increased
more rapidly following 1933 than following 1921-6.9 per cent a year between 1933 and
1937, instead of 2.8 per cent a year as between 1921 and 1926. The actual difference was
probably considerably less than the figures indicate because there was much more
construction in the industry in 1926 than in 1937. Some of the construction is done by
outside contractors whose employees are not counted as in the industry. Much of it,
however, is done by employees of the utilities. As the construction is not counted as
part of the product of the industry, the use of employees of the industry tends to reduce
the output per man-hour. The changing proportion of employees working on non-current
operations (together with the changing proportion engaged on maintenance and repairs
as maintenance is now postponed and then accelerated) makes all figures on man-hour
productivity more or less unreliable. In the case of comparisons between 1921-26 on
the one hand, and 1933-37 on the other, the changes in construction and in maintenance
policy probably cause the difference in increase in efficiency to appear to be less than it
really was.
Finished goods declined relative to raw materials in both recoveries (as is usual)


---Economics-1942-0-06.txt---
in the face of a substantial rise in the national income and of large in-
creases in taxes. Deficit financing is too new to be well understood. We
are still in the stage of trying to find out why the course of events does
not correspond to the theoretical models. Nevertheless, it is possible to
see why deficit financing at the best is an unreliable device and why it
may do little good and may even impede an expansion of privately pro-
duced income. Since the saving function is considerably more elastic
relative to national income than the investment function, a relatively
large deficit is necessary to raise the national income by a small amount.
But a deficit may cause the investment function to shift to the left,
especially if it arouses the expectation of higher taxes and if the govern-
ment has manifested a strong propensity to tax profits. In this event, all
or nearly all of the stimulus of the deficit may be canceled.8 When
but more so in the second recovery than in the first. The following are the indexes of
wholesale prices of raw materials and finished goods:
A comparison of 1926 and 1937 is of interest. Output per man-hour in manufacturing in
1937 was apparently 33.2 per cent above 1926, hourly earnings 22.4 per cent above 1926.
Finished goods were slightly higher relative to raw materials than in 1926. Nevertheless,
non-financial corporations made profits of only 3.8 billion dollars on sales of 108.4 billion
dollars in 1937, as against profits of 5.8 billion dollars on sales of 106.2 billion dollars in
1926-a margin of 3.54 cents per dollar of sales in 1937 and of 5.44 cents in 1926.

---Economics-1942-0-07.txt---
neither rising national income nor rising tax rates reduced the deficit,
who could avoid concluding that substantially higher taxes were ahead,
and that, in view of the record, they might fall in substantial measure
on profits?
To the influence of the deficit in producing an unfavorable shift in
the investment function must be added tax changes well designed to
discourage innovations and experimentation and to reduce the attrac-
tiveness of risky ventures. Between 1929 and 1936, the effective rate of
the corporate income tax was virtually doubled.9 It is no answer to say
that the tax is eventually shifted, because it is passed on only by re-
stricting the volume of investment. And since corporate profits are
produced in a large measure by innovation and experimentation, doub-
ling the tax on corporate profits amounted to doubling the tax on innova-
tion and experimentation.
Some changes in tax laws were especially well designed to penalize
chance-taking. The loss carry-over provision in the corporate income
tax was limited to one year in 1932, abolished in 1933, and not restored
until 1938. Capital losses, which had been fully deductible up to 1932,
were deductible only to a very restricted degree throughout the entire
critical period between 1932 and 1938.
Similar changes on an even more drastic scale were made in indi-
vidual income tax rates. Until 1932, the highest surtax rate was 20
per cent, applicable on incomes over $100,000. In 1932 surtaxes were
greatly raised. They were raised again in 1934 and 1936. Dividends
from corporations were made subject to the normal tax in 1936. By
1938, the normal tax and surtax took 35 per cent of additional income
immediately above $50,000; 51 per cent immediately above $74,000;
and 62 per cent immediately above $100,000. How drastically tax in-
creases reduced the marginal returns on investments in equities by the
persons who did the most saving is illustrated by the fact that by 1938
a man with an income of $50,000 would need a yield of 8 per cent
before his tax to obtain a return of 5.4 per cent. At the same time, the
capital loss provisions of the income tax were modified to narrow greatly
the opportunity to deduct capital losses.'0 In other words, the govern-
them seems to have been a conjunction of persistent deficits with a disposition to increase
those taxes which must directly limit the marginal efficiency of capital.

---Economics-1942-0-08.txt---
ment was greatly increasing the difficulty of adding to one's capital by
successful ventures and at the same time was severely limiting the possi-
bility of charging unsuccessful ventures against successful ones. Can
one imagine a better arrangement for encouraging investors to avoid
venturesome commitments?
VI
What of the long-range outlook? If to shifts in economic and political
power, which have already created difficult problems, is added a nar-
rowed opportunity for extensive investment, does not the problem of
providing employment become so formidable as to require great changes
in policies and institutions?
One may assert with reasonable confidence, I think, that the con-
sumption function will slowly become more favorable to employment.
For more than a generation the propensity to consume has been rising
just about fast enough to prevent the increase in per capita incomes
from causing a drop in the proportion of the national income currently
consumed. It is noteworthy, however, that in the twenties, despite the
rapid rise in per capita income, capital formation was relatively less
than in the preceding decade-19.6 per cent of gross product as against
22.8 per cent." In the post-war world, the propensity to consume will
be higher than in the twenties. Corporations will be hampered, as they
have been for nearly a decade, in devoting part of their income to capital
per cent a,- a loss. The act of 1932 greatly restricted the deduction of short-term losses and
the act of 1934 restricted the deductions of all capital losses to the amount of capital gains
plus $2,000.
Mr. Alexander Sachs stresses the deterring effects in the act of 1938 of the disconnection
between long-term and short-term gains and losses. If a long-term gain and a short-term
loss are realized in the same year, the latter cannot be used to offset the former. Furthermore,
if the short-term gain is not realized, the enterpriser is exposed to the danger that, in the
event of the gain's becoming a loss, it can be credited only to the extent of 15 per cent or
20 per cent.

formation by pressure from stockholders to maintain dividend rates.'2
Post-war tax collections by the federal government will probably be at
least twice pre-war. The additional amounts will be collected largely
from the middle incomes.13 Much of the saving of recent years has been
temporary rather than permanent. This is true of the saving repre-
sented by premiums for life insurance, annuities, and pensions which
in the main are intended to be consumed rather than to provide perma-
nent sources of income. Benefit payments of life insurance companies
are gradually catching up with their premium receipts and eventually
the difference between the two will be little greater than the operating
expenses of the companies."4
Too much importance, however, must not be attached to prospective
changes in the consumption function. If there is a decline in the dis-
position to take risks in order to increase capital, and a rise in the desire
to avoid risks in order to conserve capital, a drop in thriftiness may be
accompanied by a rise in unemployment."5 The large shift in the con-


---Economics-1942-0-10.txt---
sumption function in the United Kingdom between the pre-World War
and the post-World War decades, as indicated by Colin Clark's esti-
mates, did not prevent the persistence of a large amount of unemploy-
ment throughout the twenties.16 Too much attention has been paid by
recent economic theory to mere changes in the amount of thriftiness and
too little to changes in the kind of thriftiness and to shifts in the pro-
pensity to invest.'7
VII
The effect of the drop in the rate of population growth upon invest-
ment opportunity might seem to depend in the main upon how rapidly
the marginal return on capital falls as capital per worker increases.
Except for the investigations of Douglas, little work has been done on
this point. The problem, of course, is not how marginal efficiency of
investment behaves under static conditions but how it behaves under
the rate and kind of technological change and the price movements that
may be expected to occur. It is highly probable (though not inevitable)
that technological change will increase the amount of capital that each
worker can advantageously manage because inventions consist largely
of making apparatus more automatic and adding automatic attach-
ments. Douglas estimates that an increase of 270 per cent in fixed capi-
tal per worker in manufacturing between 1899 and 1922 was accom-
panied by a drop of 44 per cent in the marginal physical productivity
of capital."S This is not a rapid drop and it occurred when technological
research was on a far smaller scale than it is now. It is interesting to
observe that the drop in the marginal physical productivity of capital
was accompanied by a large rise in interest rates.'9 This contrast be-
tween the movement of interest rates and the marginal physical pro-
ductivity of capital suggests in how great measure the marginal return
sufficient to provide plant and equipment necessary to enable the increment of workers to
earn the prevailing scale of wages.


---Economics-1942-0-11.txt---
on capital is determined by price trends and by expectations.20 Of
course, if the United States by any chance were able to arrange its
affairs to permit the exportation of capital on a considerable scale in
the post-war world, the problem of opportunities for extensive invest-
ment would be a generation or two in the future.
Technological research is growing rapidly, as the ninefold increase
in personnel in twenty years indicates, and it will undoubtedly con-
tinue to grow rapidly. Indeed it must now be regarded as one of the
most important instruments of economic adjustment. But even today
there are only about 3,500 industrial research laboratories in the coun-
try. Out of over 100 billion dollars of sales by corporations only 300
million dollars goes into industrial research, or less than one-third of
one per cent. Virtually half of all industrial research is done by four
industries-chemicals, petroleum, electrical apparatus, and electrical
communications. In 1940, there were about 15,000 chemists in industry
and about the same number of engineers, but only 2,000 physicists.21
Some people believe that the present war will put the physicists into
industry in much the same way that World War I put the chemists into
industry. Private enterprise has never yet had to face squarely the
question of whether it is able to provide over the long term the amount
of employment which the community expects. When it is confronted
with this question, the expansion of industrial research may be consider-
able. Likewise one may expect considerable expansion of "new product"
departments charged with the responsibility of discovering opportuni-
ties for new products and assisting in their development. Only a few
concerns now possess such departments. Little has been attempted
by public policy to make industrial research more easily available to
small enterprises. All of this points to the conclusion that industrial
research is in its infancy and that it offers a way of providing investment
opportunities that will be far more important in the future than in
the past.
VIII
By the end of the war, roughly one-third of the pay rolls of industry
will be directly determined by collective bargaining. Wage rates in


---Economics-1942-0-12.txt---
many nonunion plants will be sensitive to changes in union scales. The
marginal efficiency of capital depends, among other things, upon the
control of management over costs. In the face of large and powerful
labor organizations, will American business possess sufficient control
over costs to maintain a high marginal efficiency of capital? Or will
unions keep investment opportunity limited by promptly converting
any increase in demand for labor into higher wages?22
Many economists believe that bargained changes in costs are bound
to be completely translated into higher prices, so that changes in the
general wage level produce solely price effects and not output or em-
ployment effects. The relationship between bargained changes in costs
and prices is undoubtedly the most important issue in the theory of
employment. The conclusion that rises in costs are translated into
higher prices so that the return on investments is not affected presup-
poses, among other things, a self-contained economy. But even in a self-
contained economy, the assumed relationship between costs and prices
requires a theory of liquidity preference which is not convincing. It is
assumed that higher wages reduce liquidity preference and that the
shift in the schedule of liquidity preference so increases the volume of
active deposits that prices rise in proportion to the advance in wages.
All of this amounts to assuming that the volume of deposits held idle
is a residual and that it is independent of the purchasing power of the
idle deposits.2" These assumptions are far from realistic. If general
increases in the wage level cannot be counted on to produce offsetting
increases in expenditures and prices, a rise in labor's bargaining power
will tend to reduce the marginal efficiency of capital.24 The resulting

---Economics-1942-0-13.txt---
unfavorable shift in the investment function is not offset within the
usual range of national income by the favorable effect of the redistribu-
tion upon the savings function.
The problem which confronts the individual investor or the enterprise
is not the effect of general increases in wages on prices, but the effect
of the spread of union organization upon the probable return from a
particular investment. When one examines this matter, it is difficult
to avoid the conclusion that large and powerful unions tend to reduce
the marginal efficiency of capital. It is true that collective bargaining
frequently raises plant efficiency by giving management better informa-
tion about conditions and by giving representatives of the men an
opportunity to point out mistakes of management. Nevertheless, power-
ful unions increase the likelihood that successful concerns will have to
share their prosperity with the employees. Until recently there has been
no offsetting protection against losses. The development of the policy of
union-management co6peration during the last twenty years has in-
teresting theoretical implications. Most of the cooperative plans have
been started in high-cost plants. They have been a way by which the
workers in these plants tried to safeguard their jobs. If union-manage-
ment co6peration were to become widespread in high-cost plants, it
would go far to offset reduction in the marginal efficiency of capital
produced by the encroachment of unions on the profits of the most
successful concerns. For the time being, however, one must conclude
that the spread of unionization tends to reduce the marginal return of
capital.
Are unions likely to reduce the return so seriously as to limit materially
the capacity of the economy to expand? That is a possibility, but
not a necessity, as the experience of the United Kingdom and Sweden
shows. One may assert with confidence, I think, that even a large and
powerful labor movement will be less harmful to expected returns on
investments than the shift in power that has been going on since 1933.25


---Economics-1942-0-14.txt---
There is nothing fixed or inevitable about the way in which collective
bargaining operates and the effects which it produces. I have in mind
a case where union policy has reduced output per man-hour over 40
per cent in seven years. I have in mind also a steel mill where the
president recently said that he would not sell his plan of union-
management co6peration for a million dollars. Such are the possible
extremes. Management has it within its power to influence greatly the
way in which collective bargaining operates. As managers become recon-
ciled to the necessity of dealing with trade unions, they may be expected
to be increasingly successful in gaining help on operating problems from
unions. The effect of collective bargaining upon the marginal efficiency
of capital will also depend upon the willingness of employers to or-
ganize. American employers have always been reluctant to organize
for the purpose of dealing with labor. Most of their existing bargaining
organizations are flimsy affairs with little discipline and meager re-
sources. The success of collective bargaining in Sweden and the United
Kingdom is largely attributable to the way in which the return on
capital has been protected by large and powerful organizations of
employers.
Ix
The readiness with which an economy translates the results of
technological progress into new investment, the resistance which it
shows to depression, and the ease with which it recovers depend in
large measure upon the willingness of individual enterprises to increase
their expenditures for equipment and for the development of new prod-
ucts more or less regardless of the general business situation-to step
out in advance of other concerns and make commitments. In other
words, it depends upon the relative attractiveneiss of venturesome and
daring production plans in comparison with cautious production plans.
The dynamic influence of venturesome production plans has been
underrated in recent economic analysis, largely because the contagious
effect of investment by one firm in compelling offsetting investments by
rivals has received little attention.
The government, through the way in which it raises its money, has
wide discretion in determining the relative attractiveness of different
types of production plans. This is especially true when the government


---Economics-1942-0-15.txt---
takes such a large proportion of individual and corporate incomes as
it now does. Taxes in recent years have been remarkably well designed
to bear heavily on any enterprise which displays daring, which backs
an innovation or an experiment, especially an experiment which is
pretty certain to experience losses for several years. The loss carry-over
provisions of the corporate income tax could be modified, for example,
to facilitate substantially the accumulation of capital by new concerns.
In times of poor economic visibility and rapid technological change,
much is to be said for a flexible treatment of depreciation allowances.
Enterprises should be encouraged to write off half of the cost of new
assets during the first three or four years of their life. This would in-
crease the subsequent tax liability of the concern, but it would make un-
certain ventures less risky. A large reduction in the tax on that part of
corporate profits spent for plant and equipment (the reverse of the un-
distributed profits tax) would help restore the practice of plowing back
earnings-so important if new concerns are to furnish stiff competition
for old ones and important in the case of all concerns in stimulating the
kind of investment which starts expansion and improves the ability of
the enterprise to attract funds from the outside. A similar principle
might be applied to the personal income tax. In the case of this tax there
is conflict between the community's interest in the principle of ability to
pay and its interest in expansion. Stiff surtaxes greatly reduce the
marginal efficiency of any investments made by large income recipients.
These surtaxes are in conflict with prevailing theories of liquidity
preference. It would not be necessary to repeal the surtaxes. The at-
tractiveness of uncertain ventures to large income recipients (or even
persons in the middle brackets), could be increased by a substantial
reduction in the surtax on that part of income invested in non-refunding
equities.26

The ability of the community to supply itself with enterprise will
depend also upon the organization of the capital market. At the present
time this is in a state of flux, partly because of recent legislation and
partly because changes in the tax system require that machinery be
developed for obtaining venture capital from income brackets which
have provided little of it. It is important to realize that neither the
volume of investment opportunities nor the volume of investment-
seeking funds is fixed. Each is the result of discovery and of effort. It


---Economics-1942-0-16.txt---
takes work and money to find good credit risks which could use funds
and to find people who might be persuaded to buy particular types of
securities. Many men make their living by doing these things. How
dynamic the economy is able to become will depend partly upon how
good a job is done in adapting the machinery of the capital market to
new conditions.

To a very substantial extent, of course, the opportunities for invest-
ment will be affected by the policies which the United States elects to
pursue toward the rest of the world after the war. If conditions are
reasonably stable, opportunities will exist for large international move-
ments of capital and for extensive investment on a broad scale. Indeed,
the potentialities of this are enormous. Here we see perhaps more
plainly than ever how dependent investment opportunity is upon policy,
for the problem of providing the basis for large international capital
movements which will greatly raise the standard of living of the entire
world is, in the main, a political one.

One may infer from this survey that the outlook for employment
during the post-war generation is not necessarily dark. In fact, it may
turn out to be distinctly good, especially in the event, by no means
improbable, that the country is able to create favorable conditions for
large capital exports.27 But my purpose in this analysis has not been
to speculate about the future, because anything can happen. Rather
my purpose has been to focus your attention upon certain character-
istics of our economy. The conclusion to which I invite your attention
is that most of the variables which determine the amount of private
employment and the rate of expansion are influenced within wide range
by policies, public and private. This is true of the relation between costs
and prices; of the way in which cost curves shift in response to changes
in demand; of the quantity of resources, public and private, devoted
to technological discovery; of the disposition to venture, and the rela-
tive preference for various types of production plans; of the position
and income elasticity of the savings function. No fixed or inevitable
values may be assumed for these determinants of expansion. Hence


---Economics-1942-0-17.txt---
there is no fixed amount of investment opportunity, no fixed willingness
to take chances, no fixed demand for goods or for people to make goods.
All depend upon conditions, and all may be greatly influenced by
policy.
Some of the policies which determine the volume of employment
represent a deliberate choice between employment and something else.
There may be a clash, for example, between the interest of the com-
munity in full employment and its preference concerning the distribu-
tion of wealth. Since tax changes which would raise the marginal re-
turn on investments by the well-to-do would facilitate the acquisition
of large fortunes, the community may accept a limited amount of
private employment in order to achieve a more even distribution of
wealth.28 The policies which represent a deliberate and informed choice
between employment and something else are not our problem. Many of
the policies which affect employment, however, are not intended to do
so. The groups which produce the policies are too small to consider their
consequences for employment and yet the total effect of the policies
of thousands of organizations of business men and farmers, thousands
of local unions, and many states, counties, and cities upon cost-price
relationships and upon the opportunity to experiment and to introduce
innovations is considerable.
Because many policies are pursued without regard to their effect
upon the general level of employment, the persistence of unemployment
cannot be counted upon to produce the changes in policies which are
needed to increase employment. If the bargaining power of labor, for
example, is too great in relation to the rate of technological discovery
so that the investment function does not permit a satisfactory level of
employment, there is no automatic change in policies to reduce the
bargaining power of labor, to raise the rate of discovery, or to produce
a shift in the propensity to save. These things may happen, but they
cannot be counted upon to happen. In fact, the response of policies to
unemployment may in the main be bad: unemployment may provoke a
flood of attempts to protect markets by restrictions which narrow the
area of innovation, cut the marginal return on investments, and pro-
duce unfavorable shifts in the schedule of liquidity preference. Numer-
ous examples of this kind of response to unemployment can be gathered
from the recent depression both in the United States and abroad.29


---Economics-1942-0-18.txt---
If the level of employment is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of
the community, who is to assume responsibility for seeing that policies
are modified or broadened so as to permit the largest amount of em-
ployment compatible with the other interests of the community? To
some extent the government can assume this responsibility. The gov-
ernment has three principal ways of affecting the general level of em-
ployment: (1) the method of correction, (2) the method of compensa-
tion, and (3) the method of stimulation.
The method of correction involves making changes in public policies
or forcing changes in private policies in order to increase employment
or, put in other words, altering the distribution of economic advantages
in order to increase the total amount of income.30 Many public policies
-tax policies, regulation of security markets, price-pegging schemes-
were adopted without an appraisal of their probable effect upon em-
ployment and even without a suspicion that there was a problem of
maintaining employment. Recognition of the existence of such a prob-
lem may lead the community to prefer to revise many of its policies.
The policy of correction would also involve the assertion of some public
control over private policies. There are various ways by which the gov-
ernment might exercise such control, but on the whole the possibilities
are limited because, in many cases, control cannot be accomplished
without a large number of detailed regulations which would be im-
practicable to administer.
The method of compensation involves an attempt by deficit financing
to offset the failure of private enterprise to provide a satisfactory
amount of employment; note that I do not say "full employment."
Strictly speaking, the method of compensation should not be used until
the community has gone as far as it is willing to go in applying the
policy of correction. Otherwise, the policy may divert the government
from thoroughly exploring the possibility of enforcing changes in private
policies that would raise the level of employment. In fact, the persistent
use of the policy of compensation may stimulate a development of
private policies that are unfavorable to employment. Why should an
up-and-coming labor movement, for example, permit the demand cre-
ated by public spending to produce more employment rather than
higher wages?
The use of deficits to compensate for a chronic shortage of invest-
ment opportunities raises very different economic issues from those
involved in the use of deficits in periods of depression when there are



---Economics-1942-0-19.txt---
idle resources of all sorts. Although the tax expectations aroused by a
persistent use of deficits do not necessarily reduce the marginal effi-
ciency of capital, as a practical matter it is very difficult to prevent this
effect. There are also likely to be important differences in the economic
effects of public and private investment which prevent the former from
being merely an offset to the latter. Private investment, being intended
to yield a profit, represents an attempt to anticipate trends in consumer
demand and thus to keep the pattern of productive capacity adjusted to
the pattern of consumer demand.31 To the extent that this happens,
private investment tends to produce a rise in output and employment
rather than in prices. Public investment, on the other hand, does not as
a rule represent an attempt to adjust productive capacity to consumer
demand. Hence, if public spending occurs on a large scale after plant
is fairly well employed, its effect will be in the main to raise prices
rather than to increase employment. Consequently, the policy of com-
pensation seems to have a much narrower application than most of its
proponents have assumed.
The method of stimulation involves expenditures by the government
which are designed to produce favorable shifts in the private invest-
ment function. Expenditures on roads or air ports and, in some in-
stances at least, on rivers and harbors are an example, but the outlay
in fact may take a wide variety of forms. The support of agricultural or
industrial research is an example. Note that the efficacy of the method
of stimulation does not depend upon the expenditure's being financed
by borrowing. The essence of the method is that a public expenditure
(or loan) is creating a private investment opportunity which would
not otherwise exist. The method is not a new one, but it is susceptible
of considerable expansion.
XIII
This brief review of the possibilities of public policy leads one to the
conclusion that the range within which the government can influence the
level of employment is broad but, nevertheless, in a non-regimented
economy, limited. Given a fairly rapid rate of technological change, a
fairly even balance of power between employers and workers, and a
well-organized capital market, the community with the help of the
government may maintain a satisfactory level of employment. But we
cannot be sure. This brings us to the final and most basic consideration.
Both what the government needs to do and what the voters will permit
the government to do depend in the last analysis upon the valuations


---Economics-1942-0-20.txt---
which individuals place upon group interests and common interests.32
There are two ways in which groups may advance their interests. One is
based upon a high valuation of one's special interests, and involves
improving the bargaining position of the group for the purpose of
getting a larger share of an income flow with little regard to the effect
upon the size of the total income flow. The other is based upon a high
valuation of general interests and involves restraint in pressing special
claims which conflict with general interests.
It is not for the economist qua economist to quarrel with the valua-
tions which individuals and groups place upon their interests. He is,
however, within his scientific rights when he points out that these valua-
tions have profound economic effects. They determine both the methods
of production which it is possible to use and the quantity of goods that
can be produced. High valuations of special interests can throttle pro-
duction and render the government and every one else incapable of
providing a satisfactory level of employment. High valuations of com-
mon interests will produce public and private policies that will prevent
there being a problem of long-term unemployment.
Is it at all thinkable that groups of workers, employers, and farmers
in dealing with one another and in pressing claims for legislation will
be limited or guided to a substantial extent by concern for the national
income? Or as these groups become more and more highly organized and
more and more conscious of their particular interests, will they become
less and less disposed to place high valuations on common interests?
No one knows. Larger units of decision would help. Wage policy, for
example, which is now made by groups too small to feel much responsi-
bility for the general level of employment, might be made by units such
as the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers on the one hand and the American Federation of
Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations on the other."3
Perhaps new machinery must be invented in order that all groups may
agree on the restraints that shall be placed upon their special interests
and in order to make possible new ways of promoting common interests.
A lively concern for common interests by well-organized and self-
conscious special groups may seem a utopian dream; but in an economy
in which the policies of government and of large private groups deter-
mine employment, what substitute is there for it? The possibilities of

---Economics-1942-0-21.txt---
modern technology are tremendous. If these possibilities can be realized,
no one can doubt that we are on the threshold of gaining a far better
standard of living than man has ever known. Nothing can prevent us
from realizing the possibilities of modern technology except unwilling-
ness to place a high valuation upon certain common interests-particu-
larly our interests in enterprise, experimentation, innovation. Never
have the rewards of a broad view of common interests been more
attractive. Never has the folly of narrowly pressing special claims been
greater. The economic future of our country and of the world depends
upon the clarity with which this is seen.

Three years ago, Professor Viner addressed this association on "The
Short View and the Long in Economic Policy."2 With a levity quite
shocking in a presidential address, he epitomized his own message in
the aphorism, "There's life in the old dogmas yet." The following
year Professor Mills, speaking under the title "Economics in a Time
of Change,"3 toyed with the idea that we might teach the old dogmas
some new tricks.
The canine pun which Professor Viner perpetrated and I have
extended turns my mind back to a story about a dog that appeared
among the last of Mark Twain's writings. It began: "My mother was
a Collie, my father was a St. Bernard, but I am a Presbyterian."
Observation leads me to conclude that economists by and large, in
spite of our mixed ancestry, are Presbyterians at heart. For the
Presbyterians lean toward traditional forms, ritualistic services, rigid
creeds, and doctrines of predestination and determinism.
The ancient dogmas for which Professor Viner made a plea are
essentially the benchmarks or the boundary posts of the economics of
the free market. And it was from "the free market as the battle-ground
of competitive forces" that Professor Mills began his inquiry as to
the course of economics in a time of change. The change which he
envisaged was largely in the nature of newer and, he hoped, more
adequate definitions of values in some fundamental and objective
sense which might guide the determination of pecuniary values in the
commercial market. Many among the ranks of both economists and
laymen have given up hope of attaining such a scheme of values
through the institutions of private business. Fascist and other totali-
tarian regimes in various countries abroad propose to end the struggle


---Economics-1943-0-03.txt---
by the short-cut method of authoritarian determinations. At home,
an essentially similar proposal appears on the agenda of our own
more outright economic planners.
The grand objective of general welfare which plan economy sets up
must commend itself to all good men. But not all good economists
accept the proposed methods of government-directed activity and gov-
ernment-regulated prices as the only or even the surest way of reaching
these goals. Some of us see reasons for believing that these age-old
aspirations of humankind may yet be brought to scientifically more
tenable and socially more tolerable expression in the institutions of
the private market, revamped in the light of our growing knowledge.
With a wary eye over my shoulder at Professor Viner brandishing
his closing warning against those who put "old poisons in new bottles,"
I wish to consider the possibility of reconciling the two ideas, sub-
limated objective value on the one side, and the processes of the free
market on the other. The context in which I wish to discuss this issue
is that provided by Professor Slichter's presidential address of last
year,4 namely, the possibility of sustained peacetime prosperity after the
war rather than a repetition of the deep "depression and disappointing
recovery" that followed the First World War. I am happy also to
fall in step with him by making my approach in terms of "policies and
institutions" as factors in the problem, which are at once significant
for the outcome and amenable to control, or at least effective modifi-
cation, by ourselves.
I recognize that this personalized, not to say chatty, style for a
presidential address is not quite within the austere tradition of our
Association. But since an innovation as to the time and place of pre-
senting this address was thrust upon us, I see no reason why we should
not venture an innovation modifying also the character of the offering.
May not something be said for regarding the remarks of the presidents
of the Association in successive years as intellectual link-relatives
rather than as discrete literary phenomena?
Economists of my generation were brought up in the tradition of
the "price-organized society" or "exchange cooperation," in a pre-
ponderantly laissez-faire setting. We have lived-I trust not beyond
our time-to experience the realities of a society whose economic life
is by no means ordered by mere behavioristic responses to free-running
market influences. Perhaps our economic system today cannot be re-
garded as predominantly characterized by determinations even nomi-
nally based on free market prices. Not only may the government,


---Economics-1943-0-04.txt---
through many of its agencies, set or significantly modify a rate or
price; large industrial or mercantile corporations, banker affiliations,
co6perative associations, labor unions may also inject similar fixations
of exchange ratios into the stream of economic life, leaving the affected
parties to adjust their operations to the resultant situations as best they
may. Or these administrative agencies-public or private-may decide
autocratically to turn whole blocks of given resources into the stream
of production or trade at specific places or to withold them. In this
event, the price system must absorb the impact of these centralized
determinations of volume as best it can.
When the irresistible force of these operational determinations
meets the immovable body of price interrelationship, or when the
irresistible force of these mandated prices encounters the immovable
body of operative reality, an economic impasse of some degree develops
unless by rare good fortune or even rarer wisdom the controlled mag-
nitude has been set in mutually consistent relationship to the uncon-
trolled magnitudes. When local tangles arising from such causes cumu-
late into a general log jam of business, we have, in Hansen's phrase,
"stagnation" or, in Slichter's phrase, "disappointing recovery." All of
us have lively recollection of the clinical manifestations of this phe-
nomenon during the thirties and many of us have a lively apprehension
of further and perhaps still more disastrous manifestations in the later
forties and the fifties in spite of the panacea of public spending that
Dr. Hansen prescribes.
It may in this connection be replied that men have in their economic
life always been making positive and simultaneous price and operative
decisions or choices, which interacted upon each other to produce the
eternal flow of self-adjusting business life. This life had its ups and
downs, of course, but it had also a dependable trend toward partial
equilibria and general equilibrium. To use Edgeworth's phrase, quoted
by Mills, there were ripples and "viscous waves" upon the surface of
"a sluggish sea." One could add that disturbances might become violent
enough to bring disaster to any individual mariner or even at times to
many of the craft within a particular area. But the duration and char-
acter of these phenomena were strictly limited by the fluid or "viscous"
character of the medium.
There are, however, polar regions of the sea, where temperatures
are low enough to freeze even salt water. There we encounter phe-
nomena to which the physical laws of fluids do not apply. No more is
the economics of individualism adequate to the problems of large and
rigid business groups and government participation in business. I think
it not fantastic to suggest that the economic phenomena of corporate,
union, and government price administration and large-scale decision of


---Economics-1943-0-05.txt---
action or of obstruction (including financial controls) move us from
the phenomena of the endlessly tossing but perpetually leveling ocean
to the phenomena of the towering icepack and the abysmal crevasse.
Confronted by the problems of such a business world, we economists
have ranged ourselves in two schools of thought. One school would
apply dynamite to the ice jam or even hope to melt the separate blocks
back to their pristine fluidity. The other would accept crystallization as
an accomplished fact decreed by Nature; they would seek by skillful
engineering and with architectural vision to shape and build those
blocks-of varying sizes-into a stable and serviceable structure of
business.
It is toward the latter of these groups that my own economic studies
have led me. Economists of today and tomorrow might well abate their
interest in the phenomena of the individual economic man following
the patterns of choice and action traditionally ascribed to exchange
cooperation in a society of individual competition. They should at the
same time guard against the present tendency to transfer the reasoning
developed from consideration of the economic functioning of the natural
individual over to the individual firm. While one individual firm may
be hardly more than a personal partnership, other firms administer the
lives and labors of tens or even hundreds of thousands of workers
and comparably weighty blocks of capital; they may sway or signifi-
cantly direct the activities of state and federal governments or even
become determining factors in international affairs. On the positive side,
we need to study much more assiduously the ways in which economic
forces (even those already studied in their individualistic context) come
to expression in the actions of large corporate concerns, national trade
unions, and agricultural marketing and pressure groups, and of govern-
ment functioning through its own ever-multiplying "action agencies."
In all this, I assume that our objective as economists is to learn how
these groups can be most effectively organized for joint voluntary
action which will attain a scheme of market values that will steadily aid
the approach toward maximum human satisfactions for the total
population.5
II
I have spoken figuratively of the need of building somewhat rigid
blocks of economic interest into a sound and serviceable structure of
business. But this, like all metaphors, harbors possibilities of mis-
interpretation. Does it imply an architect or achitectural group given


---Economics-1943-0-06.txt---
an official commission to design the palace or cathedral of their social
dreams? Does it signify a social engineer or institutional construction
company awarded a contract to translate these blueprints into reality?
No; I am not going to make an argument for implemented govern-
mental planning. On the contrary, I shall be concerned primarily with
the difference between mechanical building and social growth. There is
here no separation between artists or artisans and the inert materials
with which they work. Instead, we are dealing with a living process in
which desires, powers of choice, and internal constructive force infuse
both the builders and the building material. Evaluative human units
are not only the builders of our business edifice but are the building
itself.
The process by which many individuals of many talents may organize
themselves for the continuous discovery of their true economic interests
and the peaceful promotion of those interests in their most consistent
combination may be best described by the term "collective bargaining."
That phrase has no doubt acquired unfortunate connotations in many
minds. It is not my intention to evade or deny these shortcomings of
actual collective bargaining. On the other hand, I shall hope to show
that the degradation of the collective bargaining dogma has moved us
far and fast toward governmental control and to indicate a basic reason
why such control does not furnish a solution to the problem of organiz-
ing economic life. Then I shall consider what seem to me the greater
merits of private but group-organized direction of business activities
and the nature of the collective bargaining process by which it may
best be promoted.
Collective bargaining is obviously a development within the general
field badly described as imperfect competition, better described as
monopolistic competition, and still better as administered prices. The
chief drawback of the latter term lies in the fact that it focuses atten-
tion on the dictated character of many current business adjustments.
Collective bargaining, on the other hand, focuses attention on the ele-
ments of negotiation in such settlements. Both qualities are generally
present, but it is well to consider the element of dictation first, on our
way to the examination of bilateral group negotiation as an organizing
process of economic life.
It is in the labor market that the phrase collective bargaining
originated, and it is there that the issues which it raises have been most
sharply defined. The subject matter of these collective bargains for
labor has been so strongly dominated by the unit price objective that
they are often referred to simply as wage bargains. In fact, however,
they have characteristically embraced or been contingent on under-
standings as to the amount or character of labor to be delivered under a


---Economics-1943-0-07.txt---
specified wage rate, the kind of techniques to be employed, work sur-
roundings, and other details, so that they go far toward determining
the whole operating situation. It is the complaint of many employers
today that, under guise of wage rate bargaining, labor groups have
insinuated themselves into management in quite substantial, or quite
"improper," ways. Labor on its part would probably admit that by
collective bargaining it has sought to participate actively-it might
say more usefully-in the direction of business, in which it conceives
itself to have a partnership interest.
The phrase "collective bargaining" has attained some vogue also
in connection with commodity prices, particularly in the agricultural
field. Collectively bargained prices are found rather generally in the
marketing of fluid milk and not infrequently in the selling of other
products, notably canning crops and sugar beets. It is strictly collective
or bilateral group bargaining when many dairymen act through a pro-
ducers' co6perative association to sell their product through a distribu-
tors' organization which covers all or most of the sellers of fluid milk in
a metropolitan area. The contract price which a growers' association
negotiates with a single large sugar factory or cannery might seem to be
unilaterally collective if the processing corporation be regarded as an
individual buyer. But, in the last analysis, it constitutes group bargain-
ing between the body of individual farmers and the body of stock-
holders of the corporation, the actual bargaining being of necessity car-
ried on by the agents of both groups. Much the same can be said of
collective buying of fertilizer, gasoline and oil, and other farm supplies
by the larger consumer co6peratives such as the Grange League Federa-
tion Exchange. A great amount also of large-scale buying and selling
among manufacturers or between them and department stores, chains,
and mail order houses has many of the essential characteristics of col-
lective bargaining.
The real trouble in the transition from individual bargaining to the
group method of price making and business direction is that so-called
collective bargaining has been a child of violence and not a child of
love or even of scientific genetics. It is a matter of common knowledge
that the emergence of collective bargaining by both laborers and
farmers resulted from the growth in size and bargaining strength of
employing and purchasing units after the advent of the business corpo-
ration. But the attempt to redress the balance of bargaining strength,
once initiated, took on the familiar lines of the military race between
armor and armament; from armor that would stop any existing pro-
jectile to a projectile that would pierce any known armor; then still
better armor, followed by yet mightier guns, ad infinitum-unless
reason should intervene and institutions be devised to control the mad


---Economics-1943-0-08.txt---
race of destruction. Industrial and mercantile exploitation of the fac-
tory laborer and the farm worker gave us the labor union and the agri-
cultural cooperative. The labor union gave us the sympathetic strike,
the blanket wage contract, federal labor legislation, and the National
Labor Relations Board and similar control agencies. The local coozpera-
tive gave us the federated or centralized association, the "commodity
marketing" movement, the Federal Farm Board, and the Agricultural
Adjustment Administration.
The last step of both these series brings us to government control
along lines of class interest. Farm bloc and labor bloc appear to be
ready to give the workers in industry and agriculture a system of
implemented economic planning as soon as their clients say the word.
But before giving such a word the parties pause.
Today there are questionings among both the agrarian leaders and
the labor leaders whether they have not overshot their mark or whether
the tide on which they rode to power may not be about to engulf them.
Is it not possible that, in seeking the power of government to give them
boons that they cannot win for themselves through bona fide bargain-
ing, they have renounced their own right of self-determination and
become the wards of the provident state? Such an outcome has been
seen abroad. The widespread agricultural co6perative movement in
Russia was swept aside by the Soviet collective farm. The labor unions
of Germany lost their rights of self-determination and workers were
reduced to a servile status when Hitler accepted the task of ending
unemployment. Both labor unions and agricultural co6peratives so far
as they existed in Italy were reduced to robots of the fascist state.
The N.R.A. constituted a desperate move on the part of business
in the hour of commercial crisis to bring business in general under the
wing of government. In spite of their early withdrawal from that
alliance (or surrender), there is still a faction within the ranks of
business which looks longingly toward the comprehensive controls that
characterize the fascist state.
Before any of these interest groups make an irrevocable cession of
their great provinces of the free market economy to the suzerainty of
the political state, they should ponder carefully. Is it not possible to
utilize institutions and practices already experimentally developed in
private business and so perfect them as to bring personal values to
maximum expression and preserve desirable liberty of individual action,
but also facilitate necessary discipline and at the same time meet well
the requirements of advancing technology and of practical planfulness?
There is a tendency today even among economists to regard the ac-
tivities of organized groups in the business field as operating exclusively
toward curtailment of economic self-realization for the majority and to


---Economics-1943-0-09.txt---
assume that government activity universally affords release to the
energies and aspirations of economic men. As a matter of fact, private
aggregation and public control both lead to frustration of some of the
basic economic urges of the individual as well as to gratification of
others. It is the thesis of this paper, however, that nongovernmental
organization for multilateral group bargaining presents, in the long run
and over the major part of the economic field, the truest and fullest
opportunity for universal self-expression combined with technical effi-
ciency.
Before examining the positive case, let us consider briefly two major
shortcomings of government as an agency for ordering our economic
lives.
III
Those who regard the drift toward governmental determination of
economic issues as not only an inevitable but also a fortunate develop-
ment are prone to think of this as the only "scientific" method of
ordering the economic affairs of a people. For who can know and seek
steadfastly "the common good" except the national government that,
by its very nature, rises above all class or sectional rivalries and can
compute the common multiple of the multifarious aspirations of all
its citizens?
This, however, is a superficial view. The analogy of the common
multiple is seriously misleading. In arithmetic, a common multiple com-
pletely and precisely embraces all the constituent factors, and these
factors are determined, exact, unchanging, and consistent. But the
interests of a nation's citizens are undetermined, vague, changing, and
often mutually inconsistent. In any strict sense they are largely un-
known even to the parties and, hence, unknowable by any central ad-
ministrative agency. They have to be discovered or registered in the
very process of adjustment to real and ever-changing local conditions.
In their final terms they must represent compromises, interarticular
adjustments, and new subjective values that emerge from the very
process of making particular decisions for action as the parties at
interest are confronted by changing situations.
When government attempts to deal with these complex, varied, and
changing situations it does so through either the legislator or the ad-
ministrative official. Our legislative process is, of course, a succession
of compromises among individuals and rival interests and thus may
seem to conform to my criterion of a sound procedure for settling eco-
nomic issues. But the compromises made in Congress are in the nature
of political trades and log-rolling deals involving many extraneous is-
sues rather than being specific business transactions in which func-


---Economics-1943-0-10.txt---
tionally interested parties make a concrete and responsible bargain from
whose outcome they themselves derive gain or suffer loss. The answers
which the legislator gives to economic problems tend to be class or
pressure-group answers not differentiated according to the peculiarities
of local situations nor resolved into any consistent pattern of direction
for the economy as a whole.
It is largely in recognition of the limitations of legislative handling
of business relations that there has been so great an expansion of the
administrative arm of government. The bureaus through which these
administrative agencies function seek not merely to direct business
along lines marked out by legislative declarations of policy; they also
draft new legislative proposals or modifications and extensions of older
laws. Presumably the formulation of "the common good" by a trained
civil service will be less opportunistic or less cynical than that of a
parliamentary body. The proponents of government planning no doubt
believe sincerely that through such professional guidance we shall
attain competent direction and put an end to political patchwork.
But this administrative formulation and promotion of ends, even when
sincerely conceived as the "common good," does not give us objective
values.6 There is a certain intellectual arrogance in the idea that the
government bureau knows best. It cannot know the actual situations
with which it must deal except by proxy, and the proxy can never
be more than approximately right. Government can see only through
the eyes of its officials who, of necessity, are concerned to simplify
complex reality to an operating rule. The larger the role of direction
assumed by central government, the closer do we approach to a dicta-
torship of the capitalists, of the proletariat, of the Republicans, of
the Democrats, of the New Deal, or of whoever may ride the "wave of
the future."
Only those who are actual participants in an enterprise confronted
by a concrete situation are capable of saying whether they would value
a particular kind of security above a certain amount of income, whether
they can afford to accept this lower wage as an alternative to that
amount of unemployment, or whether they would settle for specific
discomforts rather than lose prestige or be forced to give up a long
familiar habitat or break a long-established routine. These diverse

---Economics-1943-0-11.txt---
situations cannot be averaged into a rule of wide application; neither
can they be conventionalized for permanent handling. The very
changefulness of our economic weather makes it necessary to provide
for the voices of local operative groups to be heard in the making of
directive decisions. These decisions (all of which are the stuff of which
values are made) cannot be arrived at by manipulation of data from
the morgue of a statistical bureau. Their content must be supplied
currently from the events of the moment and the anticipation of the
future-so far as the operating bodies conceive themselves to be con-
cerned with the future. The important point is that the evaluations be
real because they are written in by the actual parties at interest in the
actual situations in which alternatives are presented.
This brings us to the second basic deficiency of government as a
directive agent in the economic sphere. Even if it could actually dis-
cover and formulate the common material interest of the whole people,
it is by its very nature inept as an agency for attaining that general
interest. It lacks the necessary intimacy and flexibility to apply general-
ized formulas to the particularized situations which make the real body
of business life. Evaluations to be sound must not only be first-hand
but must also be kept constantly up to date. A law or administrative
rule freezes old valuations, whereas the business process must be kept
experimental and subject to pragmatic tests. Any politician or govern-
ment administrator is constitutionally set against admitting mistakes.
The Agricultural Adjustment Administration affords an excellent
case in point. It was a thoughtful and sincere effort on the part of its
framers to set up a scheme of economic democracy through which
local and even individual interests should come to expression within
the setting of the national problem. But however carefully annual pro-
grams, "goals," and other operating devices may be conceived in the
interest of true economic adjustment, they have to be implemented and
defended, extended or altered by Congressmen. And the latter work in
a political, not a scientific, frame of reference. Instead of proceeding
from the crude concept of price or income "parity" to more refined
formulation and practicable application of economic principles, they
have resorted to strong-arm claims for super-parity or to disingenuous
methods of computing parity that make it a farce and give us the sar-
donic phrase "the political crops."
Besides the inevitable conventionalization of values and averaging
or ignoring of particular interests, besides inevitable sluggishness in
revision of policies or programs in the face of swift and frequent
changes in actual business situations, government economic direction
has a third weakness. It fails to collect the piper's fee from the actual
dancers. It does not link responsibility and reward. Questions are sub-


---Economics-1943-0-12.txt---
mitted to political constituencies that fail egregiously to correspond to
the economic areas which will be affected by the course of action
nominally endorsed by the vote. And when results are economically bad,
they can be decorously buried under a deficit appropriation or camou-
flaged under a new political program of government action, or criticism
may be diverted by the red herring of irrelevant forensics. I am quite
aware that some of these same shortcomings carry over into private
business affairs whenever large numbers of people must work together
in a single organization. Instead of party politics we get labor union
politics, intra-corporation politics, and farm organization politics. But
these are not functional characteristics of business, inseparable from
it as they are from political organization. Whereas the basic technique
of the political state is politics, the basic technique of business is pro-
ductive efficiency.
IV
The preceding consideration of some of the shortcomings of govern-
ment in business has suggested various superiorities to be found in a
system of self-controlled business. But this carries no implication that
private enterprise as we have known it has displayed these merits in
adequate measure, or that the systematic development of collective bar-
gaining procedures would of itself introduce satisfactory conditions.
Such a road to better things would be found long and hard. If collective
bargaining between or among functional interest groups is to realize
its potentialities as the mechanism best suited to advance the distinctive
ends of economic life, four conditions must be met. There must be (1)
functional equality among the parties; (2) democratic representation
of individuals in local groups and of local units in overhead organiza-
tions; (3) full disclosure of facts and (4) sincere use of professional
assistance.
True collective bargaining must start from the premise that both
parties are mutually indispensable or functionally equal. A bargain
connotes an actual, however regretful, meeting of the minds of the
parties. It means that they have come to a common recognition as to
what is the most workable adjustment of a mutual relationship. Such
a solution is not arrived at if one party is adamant that labor is the
only truly productive factor, that the farmer's interest is paramount, or
that business belongs unequivocally and indivisibly to management or
to ownership (an ambiguity even here). Over against the sterile claim
that labor has no right to participate in management stands the patent
fact that labor already does participate in management. The denial
of the opportunity to settle basic questions by bargaining caused labor's
participation to take the form of destructive strikes, slow-downs, or


---Economics-1943-0-13.txt---
resorts to political redress. Peaceful participation between rational and
intimately informed representatives of the parties at interest is the
surest way to approach true economic equilibrium.
The second premise-an effective scheme of democratic representa-
tion-brings us to the very heart of the concept of collective bargain-
ing. If our business system is really to achieve the maximum possible
simultaneous expression of the interests of the whole people, it must
have reliable means of learning what those interests are. It is a notable
fact that, in the present organization of business, the individual
capitalist has been largely disfranchised by corporate management,
the ordinary farmer's voice drowned out by the pronouncements of the
farm organization "leaders," and the individual worker to a great
extent subordinated to the will of the labor union official. The situation,
however, differs widely from one organization to another and there are
some indications of a real move toward more representative forms and
practices. Some large corporations are beginning to have stockholder
participation in annual meetings, but this reform moves more along the
lines of grudging concession to popular outcry than along lines of sin-
cere and spontaneous efforts to get an effective registering of stock-
holders' views. The co6perative movement in agriculture has shown
some interesting and effective arrangements designed to leave control
of policy effectively in the hands of the membership without impairing
the operative efficiency of either local or central units. A good organi-
zational plan builds a two-way street over which expressions of the
varied interests of individual members and local groups travel to central
headquarters whilst knowledge of general market requirements, prefer-
ences, and limitations are disseminated down through the system to the
individual participant.
Our third premise for successful collective bargaining is full dis-
closure of pertinent information by all parties. If negotiated settle-
ments are to form a sound basis of business administration, all parties
must be prepared to furnish an adequate and honest factual picture of
the situation in which they stand. Bargains conceived in the tradition
of David Harum or the trickery of the Oriental bazaar are not bargains
in any sense tenable for modern industrial life. All parties are in fact
concerned to make arrangements that will provide for the future se-
curity of their common business venture. Imagine groups of scientists
trying to solve a problem while giving one another incomplete or
phoney data; or groups of mechanics working together on the basis of
false measurements or incomplete specifications! If business refuses to
install a modern lighting system at the bargaining table no less than
at the work bench, government will have to step in to secure full
ascertainment and divulging of the actual state of economic fact about
all the parties as they enter the area of group dealings. Collective


---Economics-1943-0-14.txt---
bargaining cannot be successfully or even safely conducted under the
rules of blind man's buff.
Our fourth premise is that collective bargainers, besides having a
comprehensive array of relevant facts, require special facilities and
personnel for interpreting these facts or applying them to the solution
of the problems by which they are confronted. I have laid great stress
on the need of an organizational scheme through which the economic
desires of all those who have labor or property to contribute to the
economic process shall come to free expression and be combined, classi-
fied, and formulatcd into a set of goals which constitute the actual
motivation of the people. But these goals are not to be achieved by the
methods of ignorance and brute strength. To a business community
that has proved to itself the indispensable value of scientific and engi-
neering personnel in its technological processes, it must become evident
also that professional expertness is no less needed on the social science
front. A beginning has been made, but there is still some lack of sin-
cerity or some failure to perceive just how these new professional
specialists are to be effectively used. Since there is much uncertainty
also among the professionals themselves, we may well give particular
consideration to this feature of collective bargaining.
V
The prominence already given to matters of business structure and
procedure should forewarn you that I am going to speak here not
merely of the role of the economist in business but also of the political
scientist or student of the processes of government or administration.
The special services of the expert in this field would be complementary
to those of the economist in any scheme of business privately but plan-
fully organized, on the basis of frank and studious collective bargain-
ing for the disposition of blocks of labor and capital. His knowledge
of the structure and functioning of large operative bodies must furnish
the setting within which the economist analyzes the content of the
deliberations of interrelated groups as to the workability and mutual
consistency of proposed price-and-production policies and practices.
The demand is not merely that both types of professional aid be sup-
plied but that the two lines of study be covered jointly. Here is a field
of truly interdisciplinary endeavor such as the Social Science Research
Council has been seeking to outline and promote.
If the interest group is badly defined or badly led, it becomes a poor
agency for economic functioning. Defects in both delimitation and
leadership manifest themselves glaringly in the pressure groups which
confront us today in places where constructive collective bargaining
is much needed. Remedy for these two types of defects must be ap-


---Economics-1943-0-15.txt---
proached through proficiencies that lie definitely within the training
and interest of the political scientist. He must work out a scheme of
organizational representation by which rights of expression and ne-
gotiation may be delegated and responsibly exercised, with information
as to results attained brought back to the individual members of the
group to illuminate and improve their future understanding of their
own real interest and of the means of attaining it.
The "organization expert" of today has some of these proficiencies,
but he is preoccupied with essentially operative devices for securing
discipline and coo6rdination within a company. Broader professional
training is needed to develop expertness in defining efficacious ways
for the parties within a given enterprise to express their interest in
functionally significant terms. We need to get beyond such crude
concepts as that sometimes voiced in the claim that labor should have
a voice "equal" to that of capital in management. The attempt to define
equality for noncomparables must give place to the search for a work-
able pattern of bargaining relationships by the parties whose roles
are widely different but mutually indispensable.
The political scientist in the business field must also aid in dis-
covering suitable means for federating or otherwise incorporating small
units into larger ones so that some decisions may be taken on the
basis of the small areas to which they are pertinent, and others on
issues regional, national, or even international in scope. Every such
organizational structure must be relative to the economic content of the
issues to be faced and the determinations to be made. Thus, as was
said above, political scientist and economist must conduct their
studies jointly at every stage of their work.
The economist, however, has his distinctive tasks as analyst of the
economic content of the company's or the association's affairs. Given
a scheme of representative business organization designed to see that
the actually felt interests of the parties to economic life have a chance
for realistic expression, their choices should then be made in the light
of knowledge both as to the facts by which they are confronted and
the effects which may be expected to follow from any proposed line of
action. Let us assume that the fact-finding agencies of government and
the record-keeping departments of the participating groups provide
as good a body of data as it is possible or practicable to collect and
that all parties are frank in divulging their information. It then be-
comes the professional task of the economist to analyze these data with
the best methodological tools to give answers to the questions which
the negotiating interest groups need to put to the data. While the
interest group with which the economist is professionally associated
furnishes the highly necessary worm's-eye view of its interest, the
economist must supplement this with a bird's-eye view of the total


---Economics-1943-0-16.txt---
economy within which the group's long-time interest must be achieved.
For purposes of simplicity I will discuss the matter from here on
merely in terms of the economist in the employ of a large industrial
company. The industrial economist ceases to be a theorist of abstrac-
tion and becomes something approximating a laboratory scientist. If
his employers were intelligent and sincere in hiring him, they will
facilitate his access to the factual materials essential to making the
analyses needed in finding answers to the questions that confront the
business. If they respect the economist as they respect the chemists and
engineers they hire, they will even let him tell them what questions should
be asked. And at appropriate times they will let the economist know
actually the considerations and the reasoning that led them to make
important decisions of general policy or particular action. Only on such
knowledge can he compare their expectations of cause-and-result rela-
tions with the sequences to be expected in accordance with the most
fully developed tools of analysis furnished by economic theory. Mean-
while his attempts to use the tools in the robust surroundings of his
actual business laboratory will show him which tools are too fragile and
which have been designed without proper knowledge of the tasks to
be performed. Under such conditions, we might expect the industrial
economist to become a vigorous contributor to the basic science of
economics regarded as pragmatic generalization of realities, not as im-
plicit theorizing of definitions.
This leads me to another and perhaps somewhat tangential observa-
tion. Such a decentralization of economic talent from the bureaus of
Washington to the headquarters offices of business corporations, co-
operative associations, industrial institutes, and labor unions should
make for the improvement of our profession at the same time that it
was elevating business administration. It is obvious-at least to mem-
bers of the American Economic Association-that there should be a
substantial number of carefully chosen and well-trained economists at
the seat of government, counseling the officials who make policy and
serving on the staffs of the bureaus that administer them. While this
position at the seat of government gives a commanding view of the
far reaches of a problem, it is also conducive in the economist's think-
ing to the resort to ideal solutions somewhat outside the range of actual
business. These may take the form of subsidies which will permit
certain operations to continue even when they would not survive in the
commercial market. Such escapism may grow out of having recourse
to the taxing power and of learning to contemplate a permanently
unbalanced budget with equanimity and a managed-or mismanaged-
currency with the thrill of adventure. It leads also to a certain loose-
ness of thinking among those who fancy an economic problem can
be solved by running away from the rigorous limitations imposed by


---Economics-1943-0-17.txt---
ordinary business terms and invoking a new kind or measure of regu-
latory control, regardless of whether the net effect of such a solution
is to destroy the independent action and voluntary choice which are
the essence of a free people's scale of values.
If, after the war, the labor market for economists encounters some-
thing of a glut, I am strongly of the opinion that the soundest solution
would lie in the direction of a shift-of those who have the fortitude
to endure such an experience-from government and academic into
industrial employment. Industry, if it could acquire a respect for
scientific approaches to business problems commensurate with the
respect it already has acquired for natural science, would benefit
greatly from the new outlook on management. But it too would have
to have a good deal of fortitude to endure the experience.
VI
If time permitted, I should like to point out that the suggestions I
have here set forth, however daring or utopian they may sound, have
substantial counterparts in actual business. There is a very large body
of practical experience, a voluminous record of factual information
available as to what has actually transpired in the various situations in
which buyers and sellers, investors and managers, employers and
workers have dealt collectively with each other. Economic studies have
been very uneven in the interest that they have manifested in different
parts of this body of inductive materials or in the insight they have
shown in distilling lessons either for theoretical generalization or for
practical action from these data.
In the labor area of collective bargaining Professor Slichter has,
from the academic approach, considered both instances and potentiali-
ties of collaboration between labor unions and industrial management
in working out mutually acceptable and economically constructive wage
rates and practices.' Under the latter he has shown that it is possible
for labor to make contributions to the more productive administration
of industry. He supplies instances in which it is the union which has
stimulated or guided management rather than seeking a one-way
street to better income through curtailment of production. From the
ranks of professional union leadership such representatives as Clinton
Golden, Harold Ruttenberg,8 and Philip Murray9 have furnished further

---Economics-1943-0-18.txt---
concrete evidence of the power of the labor group to promote the
general industrial and public interest when management is ready to
meet with labor as a true partner in a joint enterprise. On the first
session of this meeting Professor McCabe analyzed the problem of
how wide a geographical area wage bargains should cover.'0 The presi-
dential address of last year" included a suggestion that, "Wage policy
which is now made by groups too small to feel much responsibility for
the general level of employment, might be made by units such as the
United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association
of Manufacturers on the one hand and the American Federation of
Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations on the other."
From my own lifelong interest in agricultural economics and coopera-
tive organization I could draw some further illustrations and more
specific suggestions as to the modus operandi of bilateral collective
bargaining. By and large, economists do not know what the basic
principles of coioperation are, and the economics of pooling has never
been professionally examined. Nor have we even bothered to study that
substantial body of operations carried on by "mutual" companies. Some
of the time of economists could profitably be directed to synthesizing
this experience in the less conventional forms of business administra-
tion. Courage and imagination should be exercised in ascertaining their
applicability to wider reaches of business practices instead of consider-
ing merely intricate regulatory schemes and short-cut resorts to govern-
ment direction or even operation of business activities.
VII
In concluding, I shall note points of contact with the addresses of
my three predecessors. Last year Professor Slichter closed his inquiry
into "the conditions of expansion" with the words: "Never have the
rewards of a broad view of common interests been more attractive.
Never has the folly of narrowly pressing special claims been greater.
The economic future of our country and of the world depends upon the
clarity with which this is seen.""
I have voiced a skepticism that this broad view of common interests
is to be effectively attained through comprehensive schemes of state
regulation or through an increasing amount of government operation.
I have, on the other hand, not fully accepted Slichter's "two ways in
which groups may advance their interests." One of these ways, he says,
"is based upon a high valuation of one's special interests, and involves

---Economics-1943-0-19.txt---
improving the bargaining position of the group for the purpose of get-
ting a larger share of an income flow with little regard to the effect
upon the size of the total income flow." If special groups attain power
and use it to enlarge their relative income position regardless of others,
the total is in time so seriously reduced that the absolute amounts
going to them as well as to others are curtailed. Hence his first case
merges into his second; group interest is in the end consistently pro-
moted only by bargains that are, as he puts it, "based upon a high
valuation of general interests and involve restraint in pressing special
claims which conflict with general interests."
In other words, individuals in any category prosper most fully over
the years as self-disciplined participants in a functional group; and
such a group maximizes its permanent prosperity by discovering and
performing most perfectly its functional task in the total economy. This
to my mind suggests the answer to Mill's quest for a means by which
economic science can discover objective values in a world of change.
Such values are not to be found in the subjective demands, from the
most whimsical to the most calculated, of separate individuals. Neither
are they to be found in the rigid determinations of authoritarian govern-
ment since, even when the purpose is sincere, these must in the nature
of the case be subtly suffused with the subjective evaluations of the
legislator and the official. Still less can they be found in the pecuniary
outcome of partisan struggles between power groups which, if the
groups be unequal in size, result in arbitrary or coercive settlements
and, if they be substantially equal, result in economic impasse and
lower productivity. They are most surely to be approached through the
operations of spontaneously affiliated functional interest groups, demo-
cratically organized for the declaration of the interest held by members,
and for bargaining methods of discovering the most practicable means
for simultaneous realization of the largest number of such interests or
for the revision of claims and redirection of effort in the light of better
understanding of operative possibilities and needs. For a government
elite, performing in a vacuum so far as operative responsibility and
sharing in financial results are concerned, such organization substitutes
a vital process of joint administration, with responsible parties negotiat-
ing the varied compromises of competing interests experimentally and
subject to pragmatic testing and re-negotiation.'3


---Economics-1943-0-20.txt---
I thus come back to Professor Viner, defender of the dogma of the
free market. I believe firmly that the process of group bargaining
which I have sketched satisfies the basic requirements of free market
adjustment for which he raises his voice, even though the units I deal
with are much larger than the individual. But a market of group
negotiators can be a free market only as the men who traffic in it
respect each other's freedom and light the course of their bargaining
by the torch of science rather than trying to solve the problems of a
delicate organic process by the crude devices of brute force.
I trust that no one will dismiss what I have said as a mere reversion
to simple-minded laissez-faire or suppose that I am proposing to turn
the country back to the Indians. The elaborate machinery of collective
bargaining which clearly is involved in these proposals should make it
plain that it is not anarchy but a most exacting and rigorous self-
government that is envisaged. This surely is no reversion to the blind
laissez-faire of unbridled individualism, which would permit the strong
to grow ever stronger by ruthless exploitation of a favorable institu-
tional situation at the expense of the weak, who are made ever weaker.
Under democratic institutions of group bargaining, the individual
would be given the fullest opportunity for economic self-expression, as a
member of a team within a league of teams. Technically qualified
leaders would be steadily emerging from the mass through demon-
strated efficiency in the actual task of business adjustment, not in the
arts and wiles of political persuasion or maneuver. It contemplates
strictly business solutions for business problems.
It may be replied that all that I have said is beside the point because
the parties at interest do not themselves want such a solution. Those
whose sincere belief and devoted support would be necessary to the
success of any system of responsible self-direction of business are not
ready to set up such economic institutions and live under them. In
effect, this would be to say that capitalists, managers, and laborers
still are economic isolationists at heart. Events may prove that for the
near-time future this is true, that militant concepts of group sovereignty
are preferred to frank and flexible experimentation with the building
of collective security on democratic patterns. But it is surely not too
soon to anticipate and plan for a day when a few of the most advanced
industrial nations will be able to organize their business life on the
basis of economic statesmanship and science in place of economic
guerilla war and group power politics.

---Economics-1943-0-21.txt---
As to our profession, I have pointed to two desiderata: (1) that
economists acquire more proficiency in dealing with the problems of
how an economy functions when it is organized in large administrative
groups, and (2) that they be put in positions to deliver this technical
knowledge to the administrative officers of the respective groups who
are the responsible parties to the negotiation of economic relations and
the drafting and execution of business programs. Instead of being put
in a position of irresponsible power in a bureaucracy, it is much better
for the economist to be associated with one of the interest groups in
business as a consultative and experimental scientist, without any
authority to shape action or even any prerogative to formulate policy.
As a scientist all that is incumbent upon him to say is that if certain
actions are taken certain consequences may be expected to follow. It is
for the executives to act in the light of this professional counsel, subject
to review by the members of the underlying group organization.
Finally, in aligning myself with Professor Viner in support of the
view that "there's life yet in the old dogma of the free market," I do
not appear as apologist for a dogma-in-the-manger, asserting its own
logical perfection but neither rendering useful service to mankind nor
standing aside for the coming of more serviceable economic doctrines
and institutions. I appear as apostle for a dogma that perpetuates the
age-old wisdom of economic men learned at successive stages of busi-
ness development, a dogma old but ever renewed through its capacity
to give service, a dogma congenial to the minds of freedom-loving men
and ready to serve them again and yet more fully in the economic tasks
of our new day.


---Economics-1944-0-01.txt---
It is fitting especially at this juncture, for the American Economic
Association, the American Political Science Association, and the Amer-
ican Society for Public Administration to meet together. The time has
long since passed when problems of economics and government could
be treated in splendid isolation. Every phase of our economy is affected
by legislation and administration, and practically every governmental
function has its economic implications. Economists and political scien-
tists have in common highly important scientific interests and public
responsibilities.
We have chosen liberty, security, and democracy as fundamental
values in our way of life. Ever since the Great Charter was wrung
from the reluctant King John, we have been endeavoring, bit by bit,
often with failures and retrogressions, and not always with clear under-
standing of what we were trying to do, to realize these ideals. During
most of the time from Runnymede to the twentieth century, they were
regarded as applicable only to some privileged part of the population.
One is tempted to say that more has been done to realize them-for the
forgotten man and all-in the past thirty years than in all the preceding
seven centuries. Be that as it may, however, we still have far to go.
Perfection we should neither counsel nor expect. Americans and
Britishers are no further removed, in time, from Cro-Magnon man, or
from the Teutonic barbarians who beat down Roman civilization, than
are the modern nazis. There are still some among us who have no use
for democracy; some who want liberty, but only for themselves; some
who are bent on preserving their own privileged security by denying
security to others; some, even in America, who think that race and sex
are valid grounds for inequality in civil status and economic oppor-
tunity. In a word, there are many who do lip service to democracy who
are far from democracy in spirit.
Moreover, in the further implementation of these basic ideals, we
shall encounter serious conflicts of values. We shall experience con-


---Economics-1944-0-02.txt---
flict between liberty and economic efficiency, and between liberty and
security. We shall be able to deal with such conflicts only through the
patience, the forbearance, and the pragmatic compromises which are
democracy at its best; but the stream of history, the direction of moral
evolution, will not reverse its flow. Liberty, security, democracy, and
equality of opportunity are established ideals in the ethos of our civili-
zation, and there is no reason to suppose that they will not remain so.
The culture in which these values are dominant constitutes the
atmosphere in which we do our work. The atmosphere will sometimes
be murky-as on the eve of a presidential election-and the visibility
low. There will be, as there is today, much verbal camouflage, and
divergent interests will attach incompatible meanings to liberty, to
security, and to democracy. Under such conditions, economists and
political scientists must accept the responsibility, not only to be fair,
unbiased, and objective in their collection and analysis of factual data,
but also to distinguish between verbalisms and substantive reality, and
to judge between the conflicting interests which economic and political
institutions can be made to serve.
It may seem that I am bent on breaking down the line-fence between
economics and political science, and between these two disciplines on
one side and social or moral philosophy on the other. That, indeed, is
precisely my intent. In all handling of factual data, and in all logical
analysis, I am as much convinced of the necessity for scientific ob-
jectivity as the most lily-white, "pure," economist can be. But I am
unwilling to regard any social science as merely an indoor sport. Eco-
nomics and political science are purposive sciences. Being purposive,
they must be concerned with ends as well as instrumentalities. This
means that they cannot escape value-judgments.
Values
The only final value is human life, or rather human living, with all its
richness and fullness of experience. This, I take it, is what Ruskin
meant when he exclaimed, "There is no wealth but life!" The intrinsic
values comprise the things which constitute the positive content of
living, the things we desire for their own sake-work and play, love
and friendship, hearth and home, and so on, together with such general
conditions as peace, security, liberty, and opportunity. The huge class
of instrumental values includes all our material wealth of whatever
kind, all our technological knowledge, all government, and all the eco-
nomic processes of production and exchange. In fact all social institu-
tions belong in this category of instrumental values-means to some-
thing nearer the heart of man.
Contrary to totalitarian philosophy, no social institution, not even


---Economics-1944-0-03.txt---
the state, is an end in itself. The only end is the human individual-
you, and I, and everyone else. Individuals are the only living things.
Nations "live" only because they are a succession of individuals molded
in, and to, a common ethos. Social welfare means nothing if it is not
the welfare of persons. There should be nothing startling in such a
philosophy of individualism. It is to be emphasized, however, that it
has nothing in common with what is commonly known as "rugged in-
dividualism," since the latter is a philosophy of means, not ends. The
view that the individual is the only end is at least as old as Christianity;
it is the only doctrine consistent with fundamental democracy.
To put all institutions in the category of instrumental values is not
to deny or diminish their importance. No study or policy designed to
make them more effective in the service of human values is wasted.
But when, as so frequently happens, the political party, the church, the
trade union, or private enterprise is made an end in itself, men set up
false gods, we fall into futile idolatry, and the logic of economy is com-
pletely inverted. There would be less reason for such a statement in
this presence, if economists and political scientists, themselves, did not
frequently seem to hypostatize into ends the economic and political
instrumentalities with which, perforce, they are professionally con-
cerned.
The function of political science and economics is to see how these
instrumentalities work, and to make plans for their better working.
Our general task, therefore, is in the nature of job analysis. But we can-
not make an intelligent, or a valid, job analysis unless we decide what
the job is to- do. And we ought to remember that whatever its imme-
diate objectives, the job always has to do, directly or indirectly, with
the intrinsic values of life in a civilized, democratic society. Without,
then, feeling that we are departing from the objectivity appropriate to
the social sciences, we do well to bring ourselves up short, and ask of
ourselves, "What are we here for, anyhow? What valid excuse for
existence has an economist or a political scientist? What human values
are we trying to realize? And for whom?"
The job we have to do will be better done if we do not permit the
trees to blind us to the forest. We must avoid giving our whole atten-
tion to short-run implemental tasks. The program of the three profes-
sional associations meeting together this year is devoted mainly to
long-run problems, not in the belief that immediate post-war problems
will not be pressing and critical, but in the conviction that these imme-
diate problems themselves will be better met, and with likelihood of
fewer headaches in afteryears, if we approach them in the light of basic
principles, and of the human values to the furtherance of which our
democratic way of life commits us. The policies we adopt now will


---Economics-1944-0-04.txt---
determine whether later we have to retrace our steps. They will be the
acid test of our economic and political intelligence, and of the reality
of our democratic protentions.
Democracy
Since it is my purpose to try to show the close relation between
economy and democracy, I ask you to consider with me the nature of
democracy. Democracy has four fairly distinct aspects: political, civil,
ethical, and economic.
Political democracy is an instrumental, not an intrinsic, value. It is
the only form of government we dare trust. It is essentially an insur-
ance policy. It is the right to vote, to hold office, to form political par-
ties, and to criticize the government, often unintelligently, sometimes
mendaciously.
It is commonly said that a people get the kind of government they
deserve. This is only a half truth. There are distinct limitations on the
ability of a people to get the kind of government they ought to have.
We no longer live in a simple agrarian society, in which an occasional
town meeting sufficed for all governmental purposes. We live in an
economy of complex technology, extreme specialization, and close inter-
dependence of functions. All these far transcend state boundaries and
local interests. This fact is one cause of the decline of local govern-
ment. It is also the main reason why opposition to expansion of the
functions of the federal government will in the long run prove ill-
conceived and futile.
The limits to effective political democracy are fairly well defined.
The people can vote their preferences in regard to general policies and
values, but much further they cannot safely go. Even with a much
higher level of general education than we now have, they cannot be
competent to pass judgment on complex economic technicalities, on
which even experts disagree, such as the machinery of international
finance, social security reserves, and dozens of other technical matters.
The moment they, or their lay representatives, interfere with the tech-
nical implementation of general policies, they are likely to do as much
harm as good, even if their interference is not under the adroit leader-
ship of selfish pressure groups.
Although civil democracy is as vital an aspect of democracy as the
other three, I shall dismiss it in a few words. Its basic values are indi-
vidual liberty and equality before the law. It is epitomized in the Bill
of Rights, which we did not rediscover until after Pearl Harbor. But
the Bill of Rights needs to be extended and interpreted in the light of
the principles of economic and ethical democracy. Equality before the
law cannot be limited by sex or race. Yet we know that it is. Women


---Economics-1944-0-05.txt---
are not persons in the light of the United States Constitution. The
civil rights they have can be taken away by legislative act. In many
respects, in many states, they are still under the common law, in which
husband and wife are one person and that person the husband. If
women really are persons, these cultural lags should be removed, the
sooner the better.
Ethical democracy is practically synonymous with Christian ethics,
the essential contribution Christianity has made to modern civilization.
More to the point for the present discussion, ethical democracy is a
broad application of the fundamental principle of economy. The es-
sence of ethical democracy, of course, is that respect for the individual
-that individualism-of-ends-of which I have spoken. No demo-
cratically minded person will countenance denial of civil or constitu-
tional rights, even to keep alleged radicals out of government jobs, or
deny equal economic opportunity to persons who happen to have been
born women, Negroes, Jews, or Protestants. This is hard, idealistic
doctrine. Merely to state it is to suggest how far from it we are in
practice, despite churches, Congressional committees, universities, and
Atlantic Charters.
Economic democracy can be summed up as equality of opportunity.
It cannot, however, reasonably mean the dead level of literally equal
opportunity. That would be the reverse of true economy. People are
born with unequal potential capacities. Equality of opportunity there-
fore means opportunity in proportion to capacity to use it. Perhaps it
would be better to call it equity of opportunity. To distribute wealth
and income, and the opportunity they represent, in any other way is
patently a violation of the principle of economy, which is to put things
where they will do the most good. Democracy is perhaps epitomized in
the whole modern trend away from rigidity of status to freedom of op-
portunity. Democracy is a movement toward greater economy in the
utilization of our human resources. Here, economics and ethics walk
hand in hand.
I have said that economics is a purposive science. Its purpose is the
efficient management of our resources, material and human, in the
processes of production and consumption. Its proper aim is not only
to promote the distribution of opportunity which conforms most nearly
to the principle of economy, but to secure the organization and co-
ordination necessary to the full utilization of resources. This means
that effective planning, and a well-organized setup of administration,
are essential, not inimical, to the democratic way of life. If we take
production, and not predation, exploitation, or bargaining capacity, as
the foundation of the wealth of the nation, economic democracy is the
only guide to rational economic management. I wish to emphasize this,


---Economics-1944-0-06.txt---
because it is so easy to think that democracy of any kind is purely a
matter of sentiment, whereas it has a solid rational foundation. I shall
now try to show what, in my opinion, that rational foundation is.
Ideal Economy
Economists hold in their hands the formula for the ideal economy.
If it were not for a few obstacles like human selfishness, ignorance, and
stupidity, they could abolish poverty in two generations. This, of
course, is not saying much, for the real task is to clear away these
obstacles, or at least to render them comparatively innocuous, and such
a task is obviously not going to be accomplished in two generations.
Nevertheless, the general outline of the ideal economy gives the ob-
jective for the economist's over-all job analysis.
The ideal economy, it scarcely need be said, is the perfectly balanced
economic system or the general equilibrium of economic theory. Its
essential features are quickly stated. All productive resources are
"fully" utilized, according to some interpretation of that slippery term.
All productive plants are operated at the point of least unit-cost. Every
productive factor is used where it is most needed. There is thus strict
economy in the distribution and utilization of resources. The ideal re-
sult is the maximization of per capita real income.
In the ideal economy, there would be no overbuilding of plant, no
surplus productive capacity in any industry, and consequently no re-
striction of output. There would be no general overproduction, because
aggregate consumer income would equal aggregate production costs.
Demand for labor and consumption goods would be stable and con-
tinuous. General equilibrium is both the production and the consump-
tion ideal. The only distributive ideal essential to it is that money in-
come must go to people who will promptly spend it.
I am aware, of course, that Lord Keynes has analyzed another kind
of equilibrium, which falls short of full employment, but what Keynes
is doing is to analyze certain obstacles to full-employment equilibrium.
It goes without saying that the ideal equilibrium cannot be fully
realized. If it could be reached tomorrow, it would be upset the next day
by some chemist with a new compound. But the fact that it cannot be
fully attained is nothing against it, any more than the impossibility of a
frictionless machine should deter engineers from improving lubricants,
or than the imperfectibility of man is valid ground for rejecting Chris-
tian ethics and democracy. Though we can reach neither perfect democ-
racy nor perfect equilibrium, both should stand as the North Star of
our economic navigation through the shoals of institutional lags, the
disturbing currents of technological changes, and the storms of acquisi-
tive conflict. In the long run, we shall approach it, asymptotically, more
closely than we now dream.


---Economics-1944-0-07.txt---
Ideal equilibrium should not be construed in terms of the physically
possible maximization of per capita material income. Man does not live
to produce, he produces to live. Values other than those associated with
material goods will always limit the amount of endeavor men are willing
to devote to physical production. Equilibrium is a mathematical con-
cept, but it is also institutional. Leisure and material goods are con-
flicting values, and the relative valuations society places on them are
reflected in laws, customs, and contractual stipulations limiting hours
of labor and the like. Other institutional restrictions, some of them de-
creed by selfish group interest, dictate who shall and who shall not
work. Such discriminations, rooted mainly in race and sex prejudice,
are incompatible with full-employment economy. Other limitations re-
sult from decision to reserve some part of our irreplaceable natural
resources to future generations. None of these limitations, other than
those restricting opportunity to work, in any way invalidates the
equilibrium ideal. Once the people decide how hard and how long they
want to work, and how rapidly they wish to exhaust their natural re-
sources, there is, for any given state of the arts and any given avail-
able supply of resources, an ideal distribution of resources between the
various industries. This is the balanced economy which, and only which,
achieves the highest per capita output and the highest per capita real
income.
Obstacles to Balanced Economy and Full Production
Economics is a trouble-shooting art. Despite all the dithyrambic ad-
vertising about the brave new world industry is going to give us after
the war, we are still a long way from permanent full employment and
continuous full production. It is our function, as economists, to find
out why. It is monumental irony that we come so much nearer full
production in wartime than at any other time. Why is this? Since
human wants are indefinitely expansible, why should there ever be
overproduction or underemployment? Why do economists and business
leaders lie awake nights worrying about the ability of private enter-
prise to furnish full employment after the war? And why the pessimistic
undertone of feeling that with the utmost cooperation between business
and government, or, conversely, with complete freedom of business
from government regulation, full employment, if attained, can be main-
tained for only a few years? These are not mere rhetorical questions.
We cannot bypass them. What, then, are the basic obstacles to con-
tinuous maximum production?
I shall not try to catalogue them. One I shall only mention, and not
comment upon. That is the dynamic, disturbing effect of rapid techno-
logical change. The other main obstacles, as I see them, fall into three
categories: (1) moral and religious traditionalism; (2) ignorance and


---Economics-1944-0-08.txt---
narrow selfishness; and (3) certain operational characteristics of private
enterprise itself, as we have thus far known it.
Moral and religious sentiments not always, but in many cases are
stubborn impediments to economic progress, specifically because a
high material standard of living is not an item high on their scale of
values. We find religious sentiments a serious obstacle to attempts to
raise the standard of living internationally. In some countries, our own
included, religion has adapted itself to the growing appeal of material
values, and to the spread of rationalism and humanism associated with
the whole democratic movement. In no democratic country is it neces-
sary to argue that the abolition of poverty is desirable. But there are
countries where, on moral and religious grounds, the steps necessary
for the permanent mitigation (let alone abolition) of poverty would be
resisted by the people themselves.
One of these necessary steps is certainly the attainment of a reason-
able relation between population and resources. In all thinking about
raising the standard of living "throughout the world," the population
problem should be basic. Everywhere, sooner or later, cessation of pop-
ulation growth is a prime prerequisite to the abolition of poverty. It is
the fashion nowadays to say that Malthus is outmoded. But for the
long run, Malthus was everlastingly right. With the near-certainty that
we are approaching a stationary population in this country, we do not
need to worry about domestic overpopulation. But in the global field
of international economics and politics, we do.
It is being said that this country cannot be prosperous unless others
are also. This is one of those generalizations which may be something
more than half truth, or vicious untruth, according to the context. We
cannot safely concede too much to those idealists, sincere as they are,
who hold that we must sacrifice our own standard of living in order to
raise that of less fortunate-or less rational-peoples. Certainly, as an
emergency demand, no sane person will question that we must make
heavy sacrifices for the rehabilitation of the devastated countries. But
anything more is debatable. We are responsible for unemployment and
poverty among our own hundred thirty million people, but are we re-
sponsible for the economic lot of the teeming millions of Asia and other
grossly overpopulated regions? Does the standard of living to which
any given country may reasonably aspire have any relation to that
country's own natural resources, or does it not? The Atlantic Charter
called for freedom of trade-fortunately with reservations. Does this
mean, also, freedom of migration, with or without reservations? There
are people in other countries who think it does. Has any country which
does not exercise birth control the right to export its human surplus,
and thus glut the labor market of other countries?


---Economics-1944-0-09.txt---
According to the jealousy theory of international relations, pressure
of population in the so-called have-not nations is a danger to inter-
national peace. If this be true, permanent remedy does not lie wholly,
or even primarily, in free trade, or industralization, or any purely eco-
nomic policy. Definite and permanent remedy must rest on moral and
religious changes which will enable the overpopulated countries, through
birth control, to bring their populations into reasonable relation to
their resources. How such changes can be brought about, I do not know.
Industrialization may help, but the example of Japan is not reassuring.
The situation suggests a conflict between two of the Four Freedoms-
Freedom from Want and Freedom of Worship. Every people will hold
that their religion is their own business. Nevertheless, there is great
need for educational missionaries of the right sort, properly grounded
in economic fundamentals, in countries besides Germany.
Freedom from Want is a global ideal, entirely in conformity with
the principle of economic democracy; but the abolition of want de-
nends on economic progress, abroad as at home. Global economic
progress depends on the global progress of rationalism and humanism.
Until these become general, only to limited extent can the principles of
economic democracy be globally realized. Meanwhile, one of the best
services we can give the world is to set other countries a good example
by maintaining our own standard of living.
Population growth in other countries is a problem which should be
receiving our serious attention, for it is bound to have profound bear-
ing on future international relations. Perhaps Washington is giving this
matter the study it deserves, but if so I am not aware of it.
The acquisitive motives. Coming back now to the confines of our
own country, we turn to the second category of impediments-narrow
selfishness and the acquisitive motives. Here we have to do with in-
centives in economic life. Here, too, we encounter a distressing para-
dox: for the acquisitive motive-the desire to have and to hold-is both
the prime mover of enterprise and the main drag which slows down
the whole works. In conjunction with the instincts of curiosity and
workmanship, it gives us notably efficient engineering management, but
by itself it inflicts on us the business policies of restriction of output,
imperfect competition, and monopoly. It has applied science to the
development of a marvelously productive economy, but it has also been
the cause of most of the thievery and robbery, the brutal conquests, and
the bloody wars which blacken the pages of history. Even if we succeed
in ending international aggression, we shall still have to cope, within
our own boundaries, with many uneconomical manifestations of re-
gional and class selfishness-interstate trade barriers, rigid prices,
suppression of inventions, closed shops, closed unions, jurisdictional


---Economics-1944-0-10.txt---
disputes, and, in general, the behavior of powerful pressure groups,
whose heedless aggressiveness in advancing their own interests evi-
dences either ignorance or indifference to the general welfare.
These are some of the overt expressions of the go-getter spirit, which
the pressure groups have taken over from the old-time rugged indi-
vidualism. There are, however, other manifestations of it which impede
progress toward full efficiency and productivity, even when there is no
thought of restricting output, dividing the market, or of the ruthless use
of economic and political power. These manifestations, indigenous in
planless private business, include overbuilding of plants, increase of
unnecessary risks, and the various devices by which inefficient firms are
kept in business.
Adam Smith and the classicists had no worry about the obstructive
effect of selfishness and consolidated greed. They were convinced that
out of the conflict of acquisitive interests would come maximum social
efficiency and the maximum wealth of nations. No coordinated plan-
ning, either by government or business, was necessary. The invisible
hand, working through free competition, would, they thought, with
Mandeville's Fable of the Bees, turn private vices into public benefits,
and establish a beautiful harmony between private acquisitiveness and
social productivity. But the economic harmonies failed to appear. The
economic man was no fool. He knew that he could feather his own nest
better by monopoly, if he could get it. By all possible devices, he
avoided competition. Even the workers gradually learned that they
must take a leaf out of the textbook of monopoly, and through organi-
zation and combination pit their collective power against that of the
employers.
The outcome of all this is that the country is segmented into consoli-
dated and powerful interest groups. Atomistic competition has given
way to amply financed and skillfully marshalled group conflict. The
policy of every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost has
been displaced by group loyalties and group planning-not over-all
planning to maximize the national income, but planning for advantage
in the unending battle of distribution. This is an irrepressible conflict,
which economics is unable to deal with, even in theory.
Many economists have thought that marginal productivity gives us
the basis for a scientific theory of distribution, and even an objective
criterion of distributive justice. This theory is one of our pet illusions.
Beautiful in form, it lacks substance. It is a disguised residual theory,
and every residual theory begs the question, because the only deter-
minant it can find for the priority share is custom, or the so-called
"going-rate." The sooner we admit that there is no objective criterion
of distributive justice, the better we shall understand the close connec-


---Economics-1944-0-11.txt---
tion between economics and ethics, and the sooner we shall see that
acquisitive conflict is inherent in human affairs, at least in any system
based on division of labor. Such conflict can be kept from destructive
effect only by a spirit of reasonableness and forbearance, a sense of
public responsibility which transcends party, and class, and pressure
groups, and an organization of strictly nonpartisan public agencies,
quasi-administrative, quasi-judicial, for the effective, peaceful, and
prompt adjustment of industrial disputes. Substitution of socialism for
capitalism would change the configuration of distributive conflicts, but
it would not abolish them. Nothing can. .
It is erroneous to think of the acquisitive urge only in terms of
money. It is also desire for power; and the methods of power range
all the way from the flicker of a girl's eyelashes to the manipulations
of high finance. In the past, men have desired great wealth not only
for the power it gave them, but for the prestige of the showy manner
in which it enabled them to live. It was an effective way of inflating
infantile egos. I am not under the illusion that infantilism has entirely
disappeared from the mentality of all men of prominence, but there
are distinct indications that conspicuous show in living is going out of
mode. The change has been accelerated by depression and high taxes,
but it promises a profound alteration in social and esthetic attitudes.
Conspicuous waste and vain show will more and more be regarded for
what they are-the exhibitionism of the barbarian and the immature
personality. The proposal to limit incomes to $25,000 was a bit extreme,
but the fact that reaction to it was not more violent is evidence of a
changing ethos and growing public insight into the principle of economy
as applied to the consumption as well as to the production of wealth.
If attitudes toward showy living are changing, so are those toward
power for its own sake, though here the evidence is less clear. It seems
obvious, however, that those former gods of big business, the so-called
malefactors-of-great-wealth, have long since entered their G6tter-
d'ammerung. Only in dim memory can we now hear their cynical cry,
"The public be damned!" The power motive is now more frequently
coupled to what David Hume called "public utility," and we call the
social point of view. It may be that this salutary change is due to
business men's tardy recognition of the hard economic necessities-
since, after all, the public furnishes the demand for what business has
to sell-but in any case it is one more evidence of the growth of democ-
racy. Only in a democracy are power and responsibility reliably con-
joined.
I have been speaking primarily of the attitudes of the so-called
capitalist class. Now what of labor? Here, too, we are witnessing an
evolution, but for the moment it seems to be in the direction of intensi-


---Economics-1944-0-12.txt---
fying the acquisitive urge and the drive for power. The workers have
a new sense of their own strength, they are determined to have a
higher standard of living, and the indications are that they are going
to get it. It is not to be expected that organized labor will invariably
use its power with any more forbearance, fairness, and public spirit
than big business formerly used its power, or than certain agricultural
organizations have of late been using theirs.
I see no reason to suppose that the workers are less selfish than
anybody else. But organized labor will gradually come to maturity.
Parallel to the change in the temper and the public spirit of business
leaders, there is in process a significant improvement in the leadership
of labor. The great drawback is that labor leaders will not always
be able to prevent precipitate action on the part of rank-and-file mem-
bership, any more than clear-sighted and constructively thinking busi-
ness leaders can control the operations of their fellow business men.
We cannot abolish selfishness. But selfishness can be socialized.
Human nature can change for the better in the future, as it has in the
past. Men will continue to progress in social responsibility, as they
certainly have progressed since the days of rugged individualism. Both
labor and capital will increasingly understand that in a democratic
world, group interests can be moulded only in the matrix of the tran-
scendent interests of the whole people. More powerful, however,
than any purely "moral" forces will be the inner logic of private
enterprise itself. Whether private enterprise can survive permanently
depends on how well its leaders understand the logic of its own
processes, and how willing they are to heed the fact that that logic
requires, for the continuity and the over-all efficiency of the system,
certain far-reaching internal structural and functional changes.
Basic Changes Needed in the System of Private Enterprise
Three basic changes will in the long run prove inescapable: first,
some method of providing the inter-industry control and co6rdination
now lacking; second, a wider distribution of consumer income and
purchasing power; third, and corollary to the second, progressive de-
cline in cumulative saving and investment.
Inter-industry coordination. That child of the business men's brain,
the N.R.A., on which the Supreme Court practiced a merciful eutha-
nasia, would have failed in any case. Not only was it based on a phi-
losophy of imperfect competition, price maintenance, and restriction
of output, but it aimed only at infra-industry order and control. Of
inter-industry coo-rdination there was no hint, and the N.R.A. was
powerless to secure it. With all its trade and manufacturers' associa-
tions, chambers of commerce, and committees for economic develop-


---Economics-1944-0-13.txt---
ment, business is still powerless to secure it. If there is, perchance, here
and there a business leader who sees its need, he nevertheless is power-
less. Private enterprise lacks within its own organization the central
authority which alone can secure inter-industry balance. Here, if
anywhere, is necessary that central government control to which busi-
ness so vociferously objects, and which many competent economists
view with misgivings. But without such central control, especially the
rational control of investment, it is difficult to see how we are to attain
the continuity and stability of an efficient and dependable social econ-
omy. The common reply to all this is that competition and a free
market obtain this balance. But the answer is not convincing. For one
thing, the cobweb theorem applies to industry as well as to agriculture.
Call it what you please, view it with caution as you will, I see no
escape from centralized regulation of conditions which affect the whole
nation. For this reason, I have little sympathy with attempts to revive
the states' rights issue, and for the same reason I hope that business
men will exercise caution in accepting the term "free enterprise" in
too literal a sense.
There remain for very brief comment the other two great problems:
the distribution of money income, and the savings-investment problem.
What little I can take the time to say about these problems will be
elementary, and will seem not only superficial but dogmatic, since we
here touch on fundamental questions, both of theory and of policy,
on which economists almost violently disagree.
The market problem. The problem of private enterprise is funda-
mentally that of market for its product, for it is the market which ties
together production, distribution, and consumption in one great, in-
tegrated, going-concern process.
Certain, seemingly self-evident truths should be kept in mind. All
the demand for goods comes from final consumers. The consumer pays
the freight-all of it-all the costs of production, including profits.
This may not be clear in the short run in an expanding economy, but
it must always hold true for the long run. Second, consumers cannot
buy unless they have money to buy with. And third, failure of income
recipients to spend their income currently on consumption goods will
cause a glut in the market. This, in fact, has been the normal condition
with us. The market is nearly always a buyers', not a sellers' market.
Oversupply is the usual state of the market under private enterprise
as we have known it. In other words, the economy is continually out of
balance because it lacks that equality between aggregate business
costs (including profits) and aggregate consumer expenditure essential
to the continuous clearing of the market. For this continuity, there
must be an uninterrupted circuit flow of money from consumers to


---Economics-1944-0-14.txt---
producers and back from producers to consumers, against an equally
constant flow of goods and services in the opposite direction. Any
obstruction to the flow of business income, business outgo, consumer
income, or consumer expenditure-all of which are phases of the same
circuit flow of money-is like a stoppage on the assembly line. It
causes a slow-down or a breakdown in the whole works.
Saving, investment, and expansion. In general, the obstruction which
causes periodic breakdown lies in the process of cumulative saving
and investment, in their effect on the flow of consumer purchasing
power. (Note that I say "cumulative." Repairs and replacements are
costs, paid out of gross business income, and not out of savings from
net income.) Here we have the most critical, and still unsolved, prob-
lem of dynamic economy. The bottleneck which throws the whole sys-
tem out of gear is in the flow of money, either from producers to con-
sumers or the reverse. In either case it results from saving out of net
money income. In a word, the trouble is caused by that classic virtue,
thrift, although we usually reserve that word for the little man with
a small income.
The present is a poor time to argue against thrift-against cumu-
lative saving, investment, and expansion. We are in the anomalous
position, unique in our history, of a dangerous excess of consumer
monetary income over the supply of consumption goods. Our only
salvation from inflation is either more saving, voluntary or compulsory,
or more drastic taxation and price control than Congress, bedeviled
by pressure groups, sees fit to impose. But I am thinking not of the
next two years, or the next ten, but of a longer run of time, in the
belief, as I said at the beginning, that long-range forethought now may
save us many headaches later.
The commonly accepted theory is that saving (in the absence of
hoarding) cannot impair consumer demand, because saved money is
invested, and invested money is paid out for wages, whereupon it is
immediately spent for consumption goods. This theory is untenable.
Only about 60 per cent of invested money is paid out as wages. The
rest goes elsewhere. A very significant part of income derived from
invested savings is in its turn saved, cumulatively. Not all of it gets
back promptly to the flow of consumer purchasing power. It can be
shown that in a continuous series of cumulative re-savings and re-
investments, some of the money never gets back.
Since the only use of cumulative saving and investment is to expand
production, the process of expansion in part defeats its own purpose,
which is to expand the market for consumption goods. At first thought
this does not make sense, since it is incontrovertible that, in the course
of its long history, capitalism has tremendously expanded saving,


---Economics-1944-0-15.txt---
investment, production, and the market. The answer is that the expan-
sion process, based on saving and curtailment of consumer buying,
involves periodic overinvestment, overproduction, and underconsump-
tion, and hence the business depressions which it is certainly one
imperative task of private enterprise to eliminate.
Rejecting this line of theory, or oblivious to its long-run implica-
tions, nearly all business men and many economists hold that full
employment can be maintained only through continuous cumulative
saving and continual building of more capital plant. This is the phi-
losophy of expansion, faith in which we come by quite naturally.
Capitalism, the only system we have lived under, has had no experience
(save for depressions) with anything but expansion-increasing popu-
lation, new natural resources, and geographically expanding markets.
We take these conditions as matter-of-course, almost inherent in the
permanent order of things. But in the long view, they decidedly are
not permanent conditions. Those who hold that we are becoming a
"mature economy" nave some pertinent facts on their side, although
I do not agree with them that the only way private enterprise can
operate in a mature economy is with the help of government spending
and deficit financing.
Highlighted by Mill's four fundamental propositions, the philosophy
of thrift and expansion was developed when British industry, on the
make, had unprecedented, and seemingly unending, opportunity for
expansion, and when, in consequence, there seemed no limit, ever, to
the need for additional investment funds. Orthodox economists held
that saving could not possibly impair consumer purchasing power.
Ignoring the role of money they were convinced that neither over-
saving nor overproduction was possible. Taking their particular era
of economic history as universal, they did just what we are doing
today: they assumed that expansion can go on forever.
Now, unquestionably, we can build more steel mills, to construct
more factories, to build more locomotives, to haul more trains-but,
somewhere along the line this house-that-Jack-built process has to
terminate, for all these capital instruments are merely accessories to
an increase in the final output of consumption goods. The philosophy
of expansion is a dangerous philosophy, for the simple reason that
expansion can not go on forever. Business policy based on such a
philosophy will work when expansion, as now, is essential. It will work
as long as expansion enough to absorb savings is possible; but viewed
in time perspective, it is in the nature of short-run temporizing, and
it is bound to lay up trouble sooner or later.
Parenthetically, I must note, too, that economists for whom I have
the greatest respect are, like many industrialists, enthusiastic about


---Economics-1944-0-16.txt---
technological progress, new commodities, and new industries. Their
economic theory has the dynamic quality, but it lacks the sense of
repose that we associate with true art. But let us pass that by. The
practical consideration is that they fail to remember that many new
gadgets, and even whole new industries, are in the main substitutes
for old ones, and do not add, quantitatively, either to employment or
to the supply of goods. A good deal that looks like expansion is merely
ripping out one machine to put in another, with all the tremendous
premature obsolescence costs in the aggregate involved. It is an error
to assume that technological research and technological change are
the only assured bases for expanding employment. As long as there
are 20 million (is it?) houses without bathtubs, it is not essential that
we scrap our facilities for making white tubs and go over to pink or
yellow ones.
To come back for a moment from these long-run considerations to
the situation we shall face in the immediate post-war years: We shall
unquestionably need billions of dollars' worth of plant expansion. But
there is grave danger that business, in its enthusiasm and its desire to
cash in on the huge backlog of consumer demand, will unpremeditatedly
plunge the country into a runaway boom, bound to be followed by
depression. There is danger that within ten years we may build the
new capital we would normally build in thirty years, and that then
we shall find ourselves vainly hunting for investment opportunity for
an unmanageable volume of savings-if, in the meantime, the habit
of saving has not been effectively discouraged. For a time, we can
rely on the export of capital for the industrialization of the backward
countries, provided we wish to take the risks and are willing to face
the political problems involved. But sooner or later, this outlet, too,
will close. Considering the accelerated tempo of modern enterprise,
we may reach such an impasse within a generation.
Today, business men fear a scarcity of investment funds. On the
other hand, some economists think the problem will be to find invest-
ment outlet for the huge annual volume of savings which they assume
will continue to be made. Business men want savings for expansion;
these economists want expansion to absorb savings. In the long run,
both are wrong. The error of business is failure to understand the rela-
tion between cumulative saving and the consumer market. The error
in theory is the assumption that the propensity to save is constant
through time, regardless of institutional changes.
The distribution of income. The relation of the volume of saving to
the distribution of income is well known. Most of our billions of dollars
of annual savings normally come from the upper income brackets, and
from corporate surpluses. The way to prevent excess investment funds


---Economics-1944-0-17.txt---
is to remove their source. One source, corporation saving, can be
taken care of by less conservative dividend policies. It will be easier
for corporations to pay out their net earnings in dividends as they
are earned, if other measures, necessary for the stability of private
enterprise, diminish the likelihood of serious depressions. The other
source, saving out of personal incomes, can be rendered less of a drain
on consumer purchasing power by modification of the distribution of
money income. The propensity to save, which is a parameter of the
size of individual incomes, can be reduced all along the line by cutting
down the very large incomes from which the bulk of savings comes.
There is not much doubt, indeed, that we shall retain, indefinitely,
very high taxation of these incomes. We need not be overly impressed
by the cry that high taxes impair economic incentive. The trend of
wage rates will continue upward. This will be all to the good, in raising
the standard of living and providing industry with adequate markets.
With less inequality in incomes, we may hope for wider dispersion in
in the ownership of corporate securities, provided blind reactionism
does not hamstring the S.E.C. Finally, I think we can rely to some
extent on the growing aversion to conspicuous consumption, and the
change in esthetic standards which I have mentioned.
However it comes about, there is no one thing which in the long run
will do private enterprise more good than a very material change in
the distribution of the national dividend. Earlier, I advocated greater
equality as essential to the development and efficient utilization of our
human resources. I am here advocating it in the interest of private
enterprise itself. It is the only condition under which business can be
assured a full and continuous market.
Business men want private enterprise because, they say, it is the
most productive system possible. They do not know that to be actual
fact. It is an article of faith with them. The truth is that business men
want private enterprise because it is their way of life. They are not
to be blamed for such an attitude; we all have it. But we should not
overlook the lack of disinterested objectivity in the encomiums which
private business heaps upon itself. Such unstinted praise does not
reflect a wise modesty. But underneath the seeming cocksureness of
business propaganda, one discerns the evidences of a new sense of
responsibility, based partly on the fear-which I think excessive-
that private enterprise is on trial and that its survival is doubtful.
Whether there is also the breadth of vision, the farsightedness, and the
humility and docility necessary to learning what the requisites for
survival are, time will tell.
The American people want private enterprise, not on any arbitrary,
take-it-or-leave-it terms, but on the understanding that it will have


---Economics-1944-0-18.txt---
the flexibility necessary for adaptation to changing social conditions
and values. It is safe to say that they will not give it that carte blanche
which reactionaries, yearning for the days of laissez faire, demand,
under the undefined term freedom of enterprise. The American people
want private enterprise, under necessary controls, because it is their
way of life also. As Mr. Wallace recently intimated, private enterprise,
like any other institution, is an economic instrument, not an end-value.'
Nevertheless, we shall not easily be divorced from it. Just how far it
can fall short of "full production and jobs enough to go around," and
still survive, no one knows. All are agreed, I think, that it could not
survive many more deep and prolonged depressions. It is apparently
in the back of the minds of some busineess leaders that even one more
serious depression would put a strain on it which it might stand and
might not. Private business can avoid this trial, not by blaming every-
thing on "bureaucracy" and "regimentation," nor by shouting freedom
from the housetops, but by understanding the conditions permanently
necessary for full production and full employment.
To judge private enterprise, however, or any other system, merely
on its power of survival is to put the whole matter on too low a plane.
Private enterprise should be evaluated on its ability to approach the
specifications of the ideal economy, to conform to the fundamental
principles of economy, and to maximize per capita real income. The
American people are going to make far more exacting demands on their
economy in the future than they have in the past. Private enterprise
has done so well that it will have to do much better. Business men will
have to raise their sights and extend their range.
To what extent are we reducing, or can we reduce, the great obstacles
to approach to ideal economy-namely the disturbing effects of tech-
nological change, the pressure of religious and moral traditionalism,
the disruptive influences of acquisitive and power motives, and the
characteristics of our present economy, especially the great extremes
in the distribution of money income, which stand in the way of a
balanced and continuous market for goods?
As to the abolition of want the world over, I am frankly pessimistic,
until a real solution of the population problem, a solution now blocked
by religious prejudice, is possible. For our domestic economy, I am
optimistic, but with reservations. I believe that my impression of
growing breadth of perspective and increasing sense of social responsi-
bility on the part of business leaders is not wrong. If it has been
difficult, in the past few months, to maintain equal faith in the public
Address before the Herald-Tribune Forum, November, 1943. Published in full in the
New York Times, November 18, 1943.


---Economics-1944-0-19.txt---
spirit of some labor and agricultural leaders, we ought to remember
that Rome was not built in a day, and that faith may be justified by
patience. If I am optimistic about the potential ability of private enter-
prise to abolish poverty in America, to maintain full employment, and
to maintain the full and continuous market for consumption goods,
without which economic stability is impossible, my optimism is dis-
tinctly conditional. Business must be willing to give up some of its
freedom to obtain the essential economic coordination which mere
freedom itself can never secure. It must realize that with full and
continuous market, aggregate profits will be satisfactory even with
very low profit margins and low marginal productivity of capital. It
must give up its cartels and its restriction of output. In a word, it must
cast its bread upon the waters, in the faith that the prosperity of a
hundred million consumers means the prosperity of industry.
There is much to be said, after all, for the ivory tower. You can see
farther and more clearly from it than you can from the ground. It is
probable there are other-it is barely possible there are better-qualifi-
cations for the policy-maker than having had at some time to meet a
payroll. Small men will always sneer at the "theorist." It is the readiest
way to conceal ignorance. But every policy is based on theory of some
sort; and every theory back of social policy will be found in the final
analysis to be based on a scale of values, some sort of ethics, whether
democratic or otherwise.
This is why I think we need more depth and breadth in the education
of prospective economists and political scientists. I do not think that
we can assume that all the men and women who go through the infor-
mational and analytical courses of our graduate and professional
schools come out with an understanding either of the broad foundations
of democratic ethics, or of the elementary meaning of economy, looked
at from the over-all social point of view. A multitude of technical
tasks require the services of a host of technically trained experts. We
have answered this demand, but we have not sufficiently emphasized
the solid liberal education necessary to anything more. We tend to
leave broad questions of policy to others, or to the unanalyzed preju-
dices of our own subconscious social philosophy, which we have not
had the time, or the courage, to take out and examine. Economists, and
political scientists, have not demanded enough of themselves.
The difference between the statesman and the politician is that the
politician is mainly concerned with the compromises, log-rolling, and
organization necessary to getting immediate jobs done, while the states-
man looks broadly to the future. Politicians are as necessary to demo-
cratic government as experts are to technology and industry. But they
are not sufficient to our needs. As Madam Chiang Kai-shek reminded


---Economics-1944-0-20.txt---
us in her magnificent address to the Congress last year, we should not
be visionary, but we should have vision. Without vision the people
perish. Vision means imagination, ideals, and values. The true states-
man has vision. If, in the past decade, we have had some adroit and
successful politics, we have also had magnificent and far-sighted states-
manship. And now? Now, and in the post-war years, there is as great
need as we have ever had for statesmanship broad in perspective, deep
in insight, forward-looking not only to tomorrow but to future genera-
tions, and with the ability, not only to make the pragmatic compro-
mises necessary in the exigencies and conflicts of the moment, but to
hold a steady and undaunted course toward the fuller and fairer realiza-
tion of the values that civilized men and women live by.
The country, the world, needs men-informed men and women-
who, with their feet on the hard ground of facts, give thought to basic,
permanent values, and to the broad and long-run policies required for
their realization. The call is not to men and women of superficial insight
or narrow sympathies. It is a clarion call to young economists and
political scientists-young in spirit if not in years-to hear and to heed,
each according to his faith in his own developed capacities. So I say to
them, as I say to the business men: Lift up your sights; extend your
range.


---Economics-1945-0-02.txt---
"Lift up your sights; extend your range." With these words my
predecessor A. B. Wolfe closed his presidential address a year ago. In
response to his exhortation, I wish to open up with you a large subject
that is not merely of deep concern to American economists now. It
reaches beyond the borders of economics, back into the past and forward
into the future, unto the uttermost parts of the earth.
Professor Wolfe's rifle-firing analogy is highly appropriate in pro-
fessions that strive to be worthy of the adjective "scientific." We need
more sharpshooting, less waste of scattered fire. Some of the proper
targets of our aim are balloons that invite puncturing-loose ideas and
vague phrases that befog thinking, slogans that masquerade as prin-
ciples. No less worthy targets are the cords that hold the veil over truths
of importance, old or new.
G. P. Watkins did not exaggerate when he wrote thirty years ago:
"The standard of life is the central fact in the dynamics of consumption,
and hence is of dominant importance for the theory of economic and
social progress... ."' Yet before the theoretical basis has been adequately
worked out, great issues involving it have been forced upon us.
The phrase "standard of living" is in constant use-whether we deal
with the history of the past century or two, the pre-war situation,
current wartime problems, those of the war-peace transition, or the
post-war world-whether we discuss facts, goals, or ideals, actual condi-
tions or potentialities-whether we stop with description and analysis
or seek to formulate policy and set up new institutions-whether we


---Economics-1945-0-03.txt---
are concerned with our own country, backward areas, or the entire
world. Nowadays, indeed, "raising the standard of living" is increas-
ingly urged as the basic objective of high policy, national and inter-
national.
In our, highly dynamic world it is not enough for social scientists
to provide an orderly description of life as it is and to analyze social
forces as they currently operate. We are necessarily concerned with the
evolution of the social economy-local, national, and world-and with
the results of experiments, by whatever name they are called, that affect
this evolution. We cannot be content with describing and measuring
what are variously called standards of living, and with analyzing the
ways in which they change. We must also be concerned with aspects
of the problems involved in raising or otherwise improving them.
But what does "the standard of living" mean? Is it what is actually
experienced? Or what is worked for, or hoped for, or merely dreamed
of? Is its central feature total or average income, or consumption ex-
penditures unadjusted or adjusted for price changes? Do possessions
as well as fresh acquisitions enter into it? Is it simply "real consump-
tion," or does it include other components such as savings, hours of
labor, and literacy? Do freedoms of various kinds figure in it? Is it
concerned with "input" or with "outcome," with utilization or with net
results in health, efficiency, and satisfactions? Is it something charac-
teristic of the individual or group concerned, or something devised from
the outside? Does it include components that cannot be measured?
Merely to ask these questions is to reveal the prevalent confusion
of thought. In professional groups, in banking, business, and official
circles, and by the man in- the street, "standard of living" is used in
all of these senses and others. Even among economists and statesmen, it
currently means several quite different things. For each of these a
distinctive phrase with a fairly definite meaning must be employed if
serious errors are to be avoided. It is high time to reform our careless
habits of talking about "standards of living."
Basic Concepts
The chief distinctions to be drawn are between consumption and
living, and between level and standard. The basic concepts are four:
(1) consumption level, (2) consumption standard, (3) level or plane
of living, and (4) standard of living in the strict sense. The relation-
ships among these several realities are highly significant. Nothing is
gained, and much is lost, by the indiscriminate use of a single phrase
for these four different concepts and others besides.
Consumption means the commodities, their uses, and services con-


---Economics-1945-0-04.txt---
sumed; living includes consumption and much more: working condi-
tions, cushions against major and minor shocks, freedoms of various
kinds, and what I tentatively call "atmosphere." The level of con-
sumption or living, as I see it, is that actually experienced, enjoyed,
or suffered by the individual or group; the standard of consumption or
living is the level that is urgently desired and striven for, special
gratification attending substantial success and substantial failure yield-
ing bitter frustration.
These distinctions, far too important to be safely ignored or obscured,
are not really difficult to grasp and apply. In daily life we are con-
tinually aware that our operating standards are not identical with
the perfect or the ideal. We readily admit disparities between our
individual standards of order, cleanliness, honesty, courtesy, workman-
ship, etc., and the levels of our actual performance. Roughly, if not by
some form of average, we are accustomed to distinguishing between
group standards and levels in these and other respects. Even in the
fields of government and administration, experts and observers alike
find no difficulty in differentiating between performance levels, current
operating standards, and vaunted ideals.
Differences in planes of living are by no means proportionate to
differences in consumption levels. It is entirely possible for consump-
tion levels to rise while planes of living fall, for consumption standards
to rise while consumption levels remain depressed, and so on. In some
countries advance in per capita consumption levels is the principal
factor promoting advance in consumption and living standards; in
others raising consumption standards is prerequisite to raising consump-
tion levels and planes of living. When planes of living are forced down,
as occurs in very different ways in depression and war, radical readjust-
ment of current standards of consumption and living is necessary to
avert social disaster; and such disaster is inevitable if margins for
readjustment of levels or ability to readjust standards are lacking.
In expressing policy aims for the post-war period, for the United
States, for other advanced countries, or for those that are more or less
backward, it is important to be clear as to whether the broad objective
is to raise consumption levels (as most spokesmen now seem to mean),
or planes of living (which I consider a far superior aim), or standards
of consumption or living (which may also be desirable).
Consumption Levels and Standards
Actual consumption or consumption level is a valuable concept, es-
sential in many phases of analysis; but it should be called by its right
name and no other. It is a sort of aggregate of the food, fuel, and other
nondurable goods used up, the services of houses, automobiles, clothing,


---Economics-1945-0-05.txt---
and other durable and semidurable goods utilized, and the services of
human beings used, by an individual or group, in a given period of time.
What is miscalled the decline of the "standard of living," in depression
or war, usually means such reduction in the quantity or quality (or
both) of many of the goods which people consume, that their net
aggregate consumption falls. A rise in the consumption level means an
increase in the volume of actual consumption, and/or improvement in
its quality, such as typically occurs in boom periods and in recovery
from depression or war. Precise degrees of increase or reduction in con-
sumption levels are not readily measured, but either is easily recog-
nized by the individual or group concerned, and usually by outsiders
also. The reduction or increase is never uniform among all goods con-
sumed; it is accompanied by changes in composition and proportions.
Nutritionists know that a balanced diet for an individual provides
not only essential numbers of calories but also minimum or optimum
amounts of proteins, several vitamins., and several minerals. The re-
quired amounts and proportions vary with age, sex, weight, occupation,
exposure, and other factors, and even for broad averages "require-
ments" are not yet determined with precision. An individual can get a
balanced diet from a large number of possible combinations of foods,
varying through a wide range in selection, consumer appeal, and cost.
The fact of balance is likewise fundamental in consumption as a
whole, though criteria for determining lack of balance in consumption
are far less developed than in the science of nutrition. Most individuals
are conscious of any severe disturbance of their consumption balance,
while minor disturbances may pass unnoticed. One rarely finds a grand
piano in a hovel, a gourmet in tatters, or a new Rolls-Royce sported
by one who enjoys no other comforts or luxuries. Misjudgments in
choosing a home or a car, however, not infrequently entail unexpected
sacrifices in food, clothing, or leisure. Essentials for health may be
unconsciously or deliberately sacrificed to transitory pleasures or to the
acquisition of extended training. In our eyes bric-a-brac held too high
a place in Victorian consumption. In retrospect it may appear that
gadgets, gewgaws, and gimcracks loom too large in our own. Among the
most important tasks of education in various forms is facilitating
improvement in the balance of consumption, -such as the individual or
group concerned will recognize and value.
Consumption may be such as merely to sustain life,' at a minimum
or conventional level; it is in this sense that the obsolete phrase "means
of subsistence" was long used. It may go further and enhance the
productive power of the consumer and/or enrich the quality of life. On
the other hand, consumption may be so distorted as to diminish health
and life expectancy, reduce productive power, and impoverish the


---Economics-1945-0-06.txt---
quality of the life lived. Physical environment, occupational status, and
skill in choosing and using goods have much to do with the volume
and composition of consumption required to yield a given level or
content of living. Equal or equivalent aggregates of goods consumed do
not insure equivalent planes of living for the thrifty and the spendthrift,
the sober and the drunk, a Californian and a Minnesotan, a university
professor and a shipyard worker, a mid-western farmer and a New
York City business man, a 16-year-old boy and a 60-year-old woman, a
Frenchman and an American.
Deterioration of the consumption level is rarely proportional to its
quantitative decline. Raising the consumption level by no means insures
significant improvement in it. In our American life, there is wide scope
for improving the consumption level without raising it and while re-
ducing some elements in it. Overeating and other excesses in consump-
tion frequently entail not only waste but positive injury, and some cur-
tailment may be essential to improvement of the consumption balance.
Losses of vitamins and minerals in food preparation can be minimized
by methods that improve palatability as well as nutritive content, and
better satisfaction of needs and wants achieved even with reduced con-
sumption. The ways in which enlarged purchasing power is utilized
profoundly influence the net result in terms of living.
For such reasons, measures of consumption levels afford no reliable
indexes to planes of living. Broadly speaking, consumption comprehends
what is used, while living is more concerned with the net outcome in
relation to deep-seated cravings, basic needs, and other wants.
Acquisition for consumption by purchase, another concept in common
use, is by no means identical with actual consumption. Important
progress has been made in analyzing and forecasting consumption ex-
penditures, and from these, adjusted for changes in prices, are derived
valuable indexes of what is sometimes miscalled "real consumption"
or the "standard of living." Publicity has recently been given to such
indexes purporting to show that the British consumption level of 1943
had fallen 21 per cent below that of 1939, while the American had risen
15 per cent.2 Actually, whatever the virtues of these comparative
figures, they are not reliable indexes of the two consumption levels.
They necessarily ignore elements of consumption that do not enter into
exchange, the consumption of purchased goods already possessed, many
types of quality change, and important distributive aspects hidden
behind aggregates and averages.
In the simpler days of the past, self-service, mutual service, and


---Economics-1945-0-07.txt---
barter loomed large compared with pecuniary exchange. In parts of the
present-day world, and even in some parts of modern life, these non-
pecuniary areas are by no means negligible, and they are capable of
expansion under stress of depression or war. Victory gardens present
one striking example. Moreover, where consumers possess large stocks
of durable and semidurable consumer goods, consumption expenditures
may shrink or expand materially without affecting current consumption
in any comparable degree. It is a serious blunder to confuse consumption
expenditures with consumption, and to infer that changes in either
income or consumption expenditures, however deflated, imply corre-
sponding changes in the plane of living.
Consumption levels are profoundly influenced by changing consump-
tion standards, but are by no means identical with them. The consump-
tion standard of an individual or group is the consumption level that is
earnestly desired and eagerly striven for, in respect of quantities,
qualities, and proportions of the various goods consumed or wanted
for consumption. In the Western World, the consumption standard is
typically above the consumption level proper; but it is not an ideal
or a mere dream. Nor can it safely be raised, even for future applica-
tion, too far above the level actually attainable. We court disillusion-
ment and frustration if we inflate our consumption standards for the
post-war period to the point of insuring failure to approach them.
The consumption standard actually held by an individual or group,
its very own standard, must be sharply distinguished from those de-
vised by outsiders-legal, expert, or otherwise. Such external or norma-
tive standards typically refer only to particular components, not to the
entire consumption level. Sometimes they are legal minima, as in the
fields of education and housing. Sometimes they are recommended
optima, with liberal margins of safety, as are the Food and Nutrition
Board's Recommended Daily Allowances of the various nutrients.
Sometimes they are more or less well-based opinions as to what would
be "good for" the individual or group in question. The standard cost-
of-living budgets proposed by the Heller Committee of the University
of California are composites of the estimated consumption expenditure
standards of the group, padded to meet certain "standards" regarded
as objectively established and others devised by the authors.
Many such external standards can be used so as to contribute to
improvement in consumption levels. By no means all of them, how-
ever, are reliable, in general or in detail, or acceptable to the intended
beneficiaries. If applied under pressure, indeed, some may lead to a
patent imbalance in the content of living, rendering it less satisfactory
than before. In inter-war British experience, certain improvements in


---Economics-1945-0-08.txt---
the housing of working people are said to have led to deterioration in
health because higher rentals left less to be spent for food. The excep-
tionally high percentage of literacy attained by the Japanese may have
entailed excessive sacrifices in their consumption level as a whole.
Fundamentally important though good nutrition is, it. cannot be
expected that individuals or groups will give it complete primacy
among their wants. The poorest insist on their luxuries. Sir William
Petty found that Irish peasants of the mid-seventeenth century, living
in utter squalor on very poor diets, spent two-sevenths as much on
tobacco as on food.3 In parts of India the ryot living in dire poverty
extravagantly gratified "his passion for marrying off his daughters
expensively, and giving his father an elaborate funeral."4
In general, optimum standards in respect to specific needs are rarely
attainable if the consumption level of the individual or group is neces-
sarily deficient in several respects. This is not generally realized. If
the attainable average level is, say, only 50 per cent of the most con-
servative optimum, 100 per cent plus a margin of safety will rarely be
aimed at in any one phase of consumption, e.g., nutrition. Under such
circumstances, some sacrifices of needs to preferences is almost in-
evitable.
Plane or Content of Living
The most important single concept in this field is often reasonably
called the plane or level of living. The word "content" better suggests
a more than two-dimensional quantity, something in which composition
and quality as well as size are important, and something to which one
can apply not merely the adjectives high-low but also such others as
superior-inferior, expensive-thrifty, elaborate-simple, and ample-
restricted. "Improving the content of living" is much more meaningful
than "raising the plane of living." The words "plane" and "level,"
however, are convenient to use with this enriched meaning.
The plane or content of living is a reality experienced by an indi-
vidual or group. It is made up of a complex combination of consumption,
working conditions, possessions, freedoms, and "atmosphere," and the
balance or harmony among them, in relation to needs and felt wants.
Consumption includes having available, as well as using, free goods
of nature and public goods that are utilized without charge, and self-
service and mutual service, in addition to purchased commodities and
services and the use of semidurable and durable goods owned or rented.

---Economics-1945-0-09.txt---
Working conditions include hours, variety, and intensity of labor,
provision for health, safety, comfort, convenience, and training if neces-
sary, regularity of employment and security of tenure, opportunity for
advancement, personnel relationships, even beauty of working environ-
ment-and lacks in these several respects.
By possessions I mean physical stocks of goods, savings and invest-
ments, insurance protection and related rights, developed abilities and
connections, and other reserves for cushioning the actual or potential
shocks of life.
Among freedoms are included not merely freedom of religion, ex-
pression, movement, association, and participation in government, but
also freedoms to learn and to earn, to choose one's occupation, to select
among a variety of goods that combination which suits one, to venture
and to advance or fail.
Under atmosphere I include such assets as the sense of being
wanted, of security, of harmony with one's fellows-in home, school,
farm or factory, community, and the larger world-and such liabilities
as repellent fears of death, illness, friendlessness, unemployment, war,
and the strains incident to broken homes and to heightened uncertain-
ties of many kinds. The hope of progress, or lack of it, is often a
highly important element.
All of these and more, I think you will agree, figure in the individual's
content of living. Each of us can readily estimate how a change in any
element in this complex has affected or would affect his own plane of
living. With larger margins of error, we can understand them as apply-
ing to groups small and large.
Neither individual nor group is continually conscious of all such
components in the plane of living, or can be fully articulate about its
details. But the same is true of the individual's philosophy of life and
the policy of a nation: they exist even if not comprehensively formu-
lated and clearly expressed. Some components of the plane of living,
indeed, are taken for granted or lie dormant, as it were, until some
crisis reveals their existence or removal. The preciousness of life itself
is seldom acutely realized until it is in danger of being lost. Many
Americans were hardly aware of the degree to which they cherished
certain freedoms and atmosphere elements until, with Pearl Harbor,
these were threatened, curtailed, or lost.
It is highly important that we should not overlook or ignore these
non-consumption components. In the improvement in the American
plane of living over a generation or a century, it is beyond question that
reductions in full-time working hours, betterment of factory and farm
conditions of work, enlargement of insurance protection in many forms,
and increasing freedom from isolation which the telephone, automobile,


---Economics-1945-0-10.txt---
movie, and radio have brought, have figured heavily along with in-
creased volume and variety of consumption itself. The increasing prev-
alence of nonessentials which yield satisfaction out of all proportion to
their cost-of which the radio-is an outstanding example-deserves
special emphasis.
The character of the content of living, like that of consumption,
depends upon its composition or structure, in particular upon the degree
of harmony or balance among its components. Within limits, one ele-
ment may be accepted in substitution for another: heavier consumption
may offset less desirable working conditions, consumption may be sacri-
ficed for added freedom, larger savings may offset consumption restric-
tions, and so on. Beyond certain limits, however, further restrictions of
consumption, possessions, or freedoms is reckoned intolerable, no matter
how ample other elements in the complex may be.
Improvement in the content of living can often be brought about
more easily and more substantially by limited changes in its structure
than by increase in the consumption level as a whole. As in Liebig's law
of the minimum and its variants in science and economics, a favorable
change in some highly deficient component may so improve the whole
content that reductions in some others will cause no injury. Here is a
valuable hint toward the technique of improving the living planes of
depressed groups or peoples whose productive or earning power is low.
A well-balanced simple plane of living may be definitely superior to
an ill-balanced elaborate plane, just as a cheap, balanced diet is more
nutritious, and perhaps even more satisfying, than an expensive, ill-
balanced one. A very low plane or poor content of living, however,
makes the individual or group weak and vulnerable. The Irish famine
of the 1840's was so devastating because the huge population largely
subsisted on the cheapest carbohydrate and had no reserves to fall
back on when blight ravaged the potato crop. Probably the worst
damage to conquered European peoples in this war has been suffered
by the Poles and the Greeks, whose plane of living had been low.
A high, balanced, ample plane or content of living, on the other hand,
is a source of strength to the individual, group, or nation. Among other
things, it permits substantial shrinkage in one or more components to
occur without serious damage. Typically, cuts are taken where they
hurt least, instead of at vital points. The amazing record of the United
States during the present war is heavily attributable to the realized
possibilities of drawing upon various reserves implicit in our ample and
expensive pre-war content of living. By utilizing our huge stock of
durable consumer goods, and foregoing most additions to and improve-
ments in them, we could divert our plants and engineering primarily to
war purposes. We could expand employment and lengthen the working


---Economics-1945-0-11.txt---
week, and enlarge our agricultural output with fewer farm workers.
We could readjust our content and standards of living without radical
injury to health, efficiency, or morale.
Similar factors go far to explain the survival of the United Kingdom
when her engulfment seemed to many inevitable, her leadership in the
war before Pearl Harbor, and her effective continued partnership in
subsequent years. Far more than Americans, the British have demon-
strated remarkable ability to tolerate drastic shrinkage of their ac-
customed content of living and yet maintain their health, efficiency,
and balance. Germans, Russians, and Japanese have all displayed un-
expected reserves above bare subsistence that could be devoted first
to armament in all its phases and then to prosecution of the war itself.
The present vulnerability of Germany and Japan lies partly in the
narrower margins they have for contracting their planes of living,
hence the smaller reserves that they can draw upon to avert defeat.
Standards of Living
The standard of living, in its most significant sense, is the plane or
content of living which an individual or group earnestly seeks and
strives to attain, to maintain if attained, to preserve if threatened, and
to regain if lost. Though influenced by subjective factors and not easy
to ascertain with precision, it is no less a reality than the experienced
content of living. It is likewise made up of components urgently wanted
and worked for, not of dreams or visions, but in various respects it is
typically ampler than the current plane of living.
The relationship between level and corresponding standard is of
profound significance. This is one basic reason for sharpening the dis-
tinctions on which I insist. The urgent, unsatisfied wants may be for
additional consumer goods or a better quality of them, for shorter hours
of work or more regular employment, for better protection against
illness, death, war, and depressions, for enlarged freedom to learn,
speak, vote, travel, or shift occupation, for greater harmony in the
home, factory, community, nation, and community of nations. It is this
margin between standard and content of living that furnishes essential
incentives to achieve an ampler content of living. Indeed, here is a major
reason why some countries have achieved political and economic ad-
vances, and why population growth has slowed down in the Western
World. Even where in our eyes the standards are grotesquely distorted,
as most of us believe to be true of those developed under the Hitler
regime in Germany, we recognize the power of the incentives provided
by the difference between plane and standard.
Where level and standard are virtually identical, the individuals con-


---Economics-1945-0-12.txt---
cerned are either content with their lot or despair of improving it,
so that incentives to progress are lacking. Conceivably this may be true
of the great majority of mankind, who subsist on very low levels under
the pressure of hopelessness. There is a vicious circle of gross poverty,
inefficiency, and stagnation if not retrogression. One of the most
ominous facts of today is that the greater part of the world's net increase
of population is taking place where such conditions prevail. Among such
peoples, a prerequisite to improving their consumption level and con-
tent of living may be to get them first to raise their standards by stimu-
lating fresh wants and loosening the grip of custom and fatalism.
Marked disparity between standard and content of living, however,
often has serious consequences. The strains imposed by the severely
shrunken content of living in the Great Depression of the 1930's are
vivid in our recollections. It may well be that at its worst people were
generally better off, in various essentials, than in fairly prosperous times
fifty years earlier. Even so, the sharp contrast between what they had
and what they urgently wanted and felt they had reason to expect was
extremely hard to bear. In depression and in war, it is only by painful
readjustment of current standards that the conditions become endur-
able.
People differ greatly, of course, in their preferred patterns of living.
The French are noted for their consumption efficiency; on smaller
volumes of consumption, they can live better than many other peoples
can. By contrast, Americans are notoriously wasteful in their consump-
tion habits, and therefore require a far larger volume of consumption
to yield the same results in terms of living. Some individuals, groups,
and peoples set great store by security and leisure, while others prefer
to work harder and accept ups and downs if they can enjoy conveni-
ence, variety, and a sense of opulence. Freedoms of various kinds are
much dearer to some groups than to others. Certain characteristics of
the standards of living of a people or group get crystallized into the
structure of their planes of living.
Large portions of mankind, now as in the past, rate status and sta-
bility very high in their standard of living. For many individuals and
groups, however, not only change but what is considered progress is a
vital element in the standard itself. Mere achievement of a specific
plane of living is not enough. Their standard of living includes the
continued sense of achieving advances. In effect, their standard is typi-
cally rising, and mere failure to advance spells deprivation if not frus-
tration.
In the face of assumptions that standards of consumption and living
are more or less stable, the fact of changes in standards deserves re-
newed emphasis.


---Economics-1945-0-13.txt---
Standards of living most obviously change for individuals, as they
progress from infancy through childhood, adolescence, youth, maturity,
family life in its successive phases, and old age. Needs, preferences, and
priorities alter through this human cycle. For the family groups in
which most individuals live, moreover, standards of living change as the
group's composition undergoes successive alterations. They also change
for communities as these grow or decline and are affected by outside
forces as well as by internal evolution. They change for nations, as
we have witnessed repeatedly in the past thirty years. We are now in
the throes of changes in the standards of living of the community of
nations.
Standards change both under the pressure of necessity and under
the pull of opportunity. They change under the influence of physiologi-
cal, psychological, and social factors or forces. Major transitions from
one standard to another inevitably involve pain, sometimes more than
offset by compensations, whether the cause is birth or death, marriage
or divorce, prosperity or depression, threat of war or prospect of peace.
Alongside the current standard of living in the strict sense just ex-
plained, there is the deferred standard of living. Young people in high
* school or college, engaged couples looking forward to marriage, older
folk looking forward to retirement, and people in general in the midst
of depression and war, all develop more or less articulate ideas as to
the kind of living they urgently want when a stage looked forward to
is reached. Though recognized as a standard for deferred application,
this figures in the atmosphere components of the current plane and
standard of living. Individual and group morale depends heavily on the
character of such deferred standards. If these seem reasonably at-
tainable in the not too distant future, current standards will be re-
adjusted so that the current living content will be tolerable even if it is
grossly inferior to former standards in respect of consumption, work-
ing conditions, and freedoms. If it seems hopeless to expect to regain
former standards, to say nothing of attaining ampler ones, the atmos-
phere component of current living is so profoundly affected that the
basis for revolutionary explosions is laid.
The deferred standard of living, indeed, frequently rises during a
period of severely depressed planes of living. In this country,consump-
tion standards rose strikingly above predepression levels during the
1930's, especially in respect to durable consumers' goods. Technical
improvements, cost reductions, low-price policies, and effective advertis-
ing led to impressive enlargement of the role of many durable consumer
goods in American life. This culminated in the huge output and pur-
chases of durable consumer goods in 1941. It is not yet generally


---Economics-1945-0-14.txt---
appreciated how important a cushion against the wartime restrictions
since Pearl Harbor was provided by the heavy stocking up with dura-
ble and semidurable goods in the years 1938-41.
During the current war, in respect of consumption and adjustment
among the components of the content of living, our standards for de-
ferred application have risen strikingly. This is partly because of
technological improvements, prospects of cost reductions, hopes of
larger national income, and extensive advertising of goods and goals.
It is partly because millions have earned larger incomes, accumulated
more savings, and/or acquired more claims on future income than they
ever expected to have, and they feel justified in cherishing ampler and
better balanced deferred standards of living which a decade ago would
have seemed vain dreams. Meanwhile, other millions, who have had to
endure painful readjustments in their current content and standard
of living, feel justified in expecting at least to regain and even to im-
prove upon their former levels. Customer research organizations and
polls of public opinion have already scratched the surface of ascer-
taining some of the specific ways in which standards for post-war appli-
cation differ from the present content of living.
Now, however, we are in danger of erroneously forecasting the stand-
ard of living that Americans will choose after the war. I doubt very
much if we shall choose the combination of goods, work, freedoms, etc.,
that will yield a national income averaging 10-15 per cent above $1,000
per capita in 1943 dollars. Other factors aside, a good deal of the
increased money income during the war represents the extra inducement
to make sacrifices, for the time, in consumption, leisure, working con-
ditions, and freedoms. In the absence of national emergency even this
inducement would not suffice. From the standpoint of past and pros-
pective peacetime standards, we are considerably overemployed now.
When the war is really over, I do not believe that 60 million out of
135-140 million will choose to be "productively employed," if this is
interpreted in the usual narrow sense of excluding homemakers, vol-
unteer workers, the armed services, and those in various levels of
schooling, unless a far greater number engage in part-time employment
than is in prospect. The post-war standard of living that the people
actually choose will have more influence on the content of living than
the standards put forward by specialists, publicists, and political
leaders.
Conclusion
I have tried to make it easier to use a number of good terms with
fairly specific meanings, and to make it harder to use the phrase "stand-
ard of living" without pausing to consider which of a score of diverse


---Economics-1945-0-15.txt---
meanings is intended. I have also endeavored to bring into clearer view
a few truths that are too often obscured by loose thinking and speaking.
If time permitted, I should like to explore the subject much further:
to examine the impact of the present war on consumption and living
levels and standards, in the United States and other countries, and to
try to forecast the types of readjustment to be expected; to consider
some difficult problems of measurement, and the possibilites of deriving
significant indexes of planes of living; to inquire how far inter-group
and international differences in levels or standards are normal and
should persist, and to what degree steps toward what is miscalled
"equalization" are desirable and feasible; to elucidate further the
interrelationship between levels and standards, and changes in stand-
ards themselves; to analyze some promising techniques for improving
the plane or content of living where it is especially low or restricted;
and to reappraise standards of living in the Western World in the light
of world population trends.
These are some of the targets within range. I have ammunition to
spare, and am eager to test my markmanship further. But the order to
cease firing is about to be given, and I must conclude with a brief state-
ment of faith.
Improving planes and content of living, with due respect to varied
needs and preferences, is an eminently practical and wholesome over-
all objective of individual ambition and of national and international
policy. Achievement of such improvement is no mere humanitarian
dream. It is basic to attaining fuller utilization of available resources,
hence of serious concern to economists. It is fundamental to the main-
tenance of peace and orderly political progress, hence of serious con-
cern to political scientists as well.
Amid the strains and drains of war, it has been borne in upon us
that the world's productive powers are far larger than had been realized.
We are raising our sights and extending our range. Despite appalling
wastes and devastation, most of the vast accumulations of the ages
remain for widening use. Depletion of exhaustible resources has been
more than offset by new discoveries and techniques of substitution. War-
time pressures have compelled learning new arts and stimulated effec-
tive research into better means of satisfying wants for essentials, com-
forts, and luxuries. Science, technology, and management have achieved
near-miracles, and many more are in the offing. Increased mobility and
better communications facilitate co'operation over great distances.
New machinery for international operation is under construction.
We have much to learn and far to go before we shall attain the
understanding and master the techniques of social engineering that


---Economics-1945-0-16.txt---
the tasks call for. We must bravely face the prospect that nothing like
the full potentialities can be realized within calculable time. Even so,
there is ground for expecting that, in the next twenty to thirty years,
the planes of living of most of the world's peoples can be raised well
above the pre-war levels. Our own national interests are deeply involved
in translating this possibility into actual fact. The rate and degree of
progress in this direction will depend heavily upon the people and gov-
ernment of the United States. And important contributions from econ-
omists and other social scientists will be essential to sound progress
toward these reasonable goals.


---Economics-1946-0-03.txt---
In view of the fact that the war situation, though happily, in the end,
rendering possible our assembly here, has prevented the integration
of our discussions with those of other social science organizations, it
seems appropriate that this address should not confine itself to strictly
economic matters. More than ever the various social science disciplines
are closely interrelated. They find a common focus in the sphere of
public policy, especially as reflected in law and its development. My
observations, epitomized as the relationship between law and economics,
bear upon the processes of public control of economic activity.
I
As one scans the program of economic discussion being presented at
these meetings, it is obvious that its dominant emphasis is upon matters
of public policy.2
There, are sessions, it is true, devoted specifically to the interpretation
of recent economic history, the analysis of prevailing economic condi-
tions, the development of basic economic theorizing. But even these
discussions cannot escape the pervasive influence of the role of
government in the economic life of the nation. The inter-war economy
reflected in striking fashion both the relative public quiescence of the
1920's and the frantic governmental efforts at recovery and reform of
the 1930's. Interpretation of this period poses the problem of how
intimately collective action or inaction bore upon the great economic
debacle with which we came to be faced, and upon the many frustra-
tions, including the development of world conditions favorable to the
outbreak of international strife on an unprecedented scale, which
followed in its wake. Analysis of the changing structure of our


---Economics-1946-0-04.txt---
contemporary economy, with reference to such matters as the location
of industries, the distribution of manpower, the conditioning environ-
ment of financial practice, must find the roots of change, not only in
the extraordinary circumstances of the war effort, but in significant
preexisting tendencies; and pre-war developments, only to a lesser
degree than the pattern of the war economy, have drawn sustenance,
for good or for ill, from the character and direction of government in-
tervention. A like relevance is generally recognized in our theoretical
thinking concerning the over-all organization and functioning of the
economic order. Exploration of current advances in economic thought
cannot, with any approach to realism, be restricted to narrow technical
contributions in the traditional sphere of economic theory. There are
basic limitations upon the adequacy of economic law, either as a reliable
description of the complexities of prevailing economic processes or as
a fruitful practical guide to social policy. In thought as in action a
consideration of the reciprocal influence of freedom and control upon
the operation of the economy is indispensable to promising inquiry. At
this juncture it would obviously be folly to ignore the revealing
experience of the great depression and the world war, with their
extensive subordination of individual enterprise to collective action, or
the impact of this experience, whether deemed favorable or unfavorable
to public control, upon the character of post-war policies. Even
fundamental thinking must reflect at least the value implications of
important policy trends.
But the discussions at these meetings are more largely concerned
with direct issues of public policy, in relation to specific problems of
outstanding significance. Within the limits of a short few days, they
can traverse only a relatively small number of representative fields; but
in each instance the principal emphasis is upon governmental activity,
from the standpoint of the service or disservice of past performance
and of future threat or promise. This applies to the domestic as well
as to the international problems being explored. Actual or potential
measures of social cooperation embodied in legal requirements, in
numerous sectors of the economy and through a great variety of
expedients, provide much of the basic material for analysis and con-
stitute the major sources of controversy.
Such matters as monetary and fiscal policy, whether dealt with as
more or less self-contained segments of investigation or in relation to
the maintenance of economic stability at a high level of production and
employment, involve existing and proposed instruments and objectives
that go far beyond mere reliance upon automatic exchange mecha-
nisms or the traditional use of the spending and taxing powers of
government. Similarly, the economist's long-established convictions


---Economics-1946-0-05.txt---
concerning the fruitfulness of freedom of international trade and
investment have come to be conditioned, in light of the disruptive and
depressing effects of recent trends to economic autarchy, by the
efficacy of institutional arrangements for international economic
cooperation. Not only must consideration be given to the purposes and
probable results of such emerging world agencies as those for monetary
stabilization and economic reconstruction and development, but the
solution of numerous related problems is likewise dependent in large
measure upon concert of action. Problems of commercial policy, capital
movements, cartel arrangements, commodity agreements, technological
restrictions, shipping adjustments, agricultural relationships-whether
ostensibly attacked as matters primarily of national concern or frankly
viewed in their international implications as well as in their domestic
aspects-must necessarily be recognized as intricate problems of public
policy. They embrace the distinctive economic circumstances of foreign
areas as well as our own needs and aspirations; they are complicated
by a diversity of national and international goals; they involve much
more than the mere analysis of economic factors in terms of established
economic principles.
And our concern with matters of policy is equally clear in most of
the remaining subjects of discussion. The reexamination of the outlook
for effective competition, after more than a half-century of checkered
governmental effort to this end, not only necessitates a consideration
of the vitality of contemporary competitive rivalry and the feasibility,
under prevailing circumstances of ownership and control, of relying
predominantly upon the free operation of economic forces, but raises
also crucial questions of principle and practice bearing upon the defini-
tion and maintenance of competitive conditions, and brings to issue the
rather perplexing relationship between competitive policy and positive
measures of collective enterprise and public control. These affirmative
policies, furthermore, even when confined to such so-called naturally
monopolistic industries as railroads and public utilities, require constant
and informed appraisal, in the interest of evolving regulatory standards
and expedients which in terms of actual performance are effectively
adjusted to the changing circumstances and conditions of our economic
development. The prevailing status of labor relations has likewise been
molded in large measure by governmental activity. The strengthening
of labor's position, as a result of statutory and administrative imple-
mentation of its right to collective bargaining through freely chosen
representatives, has aroused deep concern in many quarters over the
monopolistic potentialities of vast labor organizations; and the use of
immense economic power by these organizations, through resort to the
strike weapon as the culminating phase of abortive collective bargaining


---Economics-1946-0-06.txt---
procedures, has disclosed serious gaps in public policy and need for
supplementary enactments to facilitate the adjuistment of laboir
disputes. Finally, reliance upon public planning, for the purpose of
stabilizing economic activity, eliminating mass unemployment, further-
ing the full use of productive resources, and increasing the flow of real
income, demands at every turn incisive exploration of both existing and
proposed governmental policies and practices.
In all these spheres, and in many others, there is manifest need for
focusing informed economic opinion upon the policy problems involved;
and in light of the great diversities of view that appear to prevail among
economists, methods and procedures are being developed by the
American Economic Association for cooperative definition of areas of
agreement and disagreement, so that professional knowledge and insight
and understanding may exert their appropriate influence in fashioning
the character of the institutions and arrangements which condition or
govern economic behavior.
II
Nor is this concern with policy problems either a new development
or a mere reflectioln of the special interests of particular program-
builders. The American Economic Association wa.s organized in 1885,
after a modest start had already been made, chiefly by the states, in
the field of public control of economic activity. It was born immediately
before government regulation, apart from tariff policy, first emerged
on a national basis through the adoption of the act to Regulate Com-
merce in 1887 and the Sherman Anti-Trust act in 1890. In these
circumstances, and in view of the generally recognized scope of modern
political economy, it has been within the tradition of the Association
from the beginning to be concerned with the nature and purposes and
effects of government intervention in economic matters, not only with
a view to achieving better understanding of the functioning of the
economic order, but also in'the hope at least, so frequently frustrated
in the classic case of the tariff, that informed opinion might provide
some measure of guidance in the evolution of public policy.
As long as governmental activity confined itself for the most part to
imposing piecemeal restraints and special obligations upon particular
aspects or segments of business enterprise, for the purpose of eliminat-
ing or mitigating specific abuses, policy questions were largely
investigated by small groups of economists, acting within limited
spheres, as mere incidents to the adequate cultivation of their respective
specialties. This approach prevailed even in connection with the
comprehensive affirmative controls over rates, service, finance, and
related matters which were gradually developed in the public service


---Economics-1946-0-07.txt---
industries; and it was also measurably characteristic of the policies
of credit control which resulted from the establishment of the Federal
Reserve System, despite the more direct relationship of such control to
the operation of the economy as a whole. But with the accumulation of
a vast mass of controls in course of the years, however miscellaneous
in character and lacking in co,6rdination, most economists came to be
intimately concerned with a considerable variety of expressions of
public policy; and of more far-reaching importance, with the
assumption during the great depression of positive governmental
responsibilities, of diverse types, for increasing economic activity and
maintaining economic stability, virtually all economic inquiry came to
involve, and to be conditioned by, issues of public policy. This situatioin
has been further sustained by government domination of economic
activity during the war years; and on a more enduring basis, by the
well-nigh universally accepted objective of striving for sharply increased
production and employment and well-being, as compared with the
best of pre-war achievements, for the years that lie ahead. These more
recent phases of economic policy have ushered in important changes in
the kind as well as in the extent of relevant public controls. When
economists were chiefly preoccupied with cost-price factors, operating
in freely competitive markets, as means of achieving automatic guid-
ance oif the utilization of resources and apportionment of income,
economic analysis could concern itself with policy matters only in an
incidental way; for in these circumstances public policy, except in
special situations, was merely directed to maintaining the framework
of private enterprise. But when, with depression and war, resort was
had to many direct controls, of positive bearing upon the development
of production and distribution, policy issues came to pervade the entire
field of economic investigation; and the far-reaching problems involved
are being carried forward into the period of post-war readjustment.
For the past decade and a half economists have struggled intensively
with the inherent complexities and practical difficulties of economic
policy. They have played a necessary and important rlole in government
itself, and they are likely to continue to do so on a substantial scale.
Their influence, in and out of government service, may be fruitfully
exerted for both the relaxation and the extension of controls, depending
upon the specific character of prevailing and projected governmental
measures. It is of the very nature of public policy under democratic
institutions that it is fashioned out of a wide diversity of views, even
among experts; and in these circumstances large areas of disagreement,
involving in major degree conflicts of judgment rather than differences
as to fundamentals, are bound to persist. But most economists, repudiat-
ing with the vast majority of men and women the defeatist notion of the


---Economics-1946-0-08.txt---
futility of human effort, share the common determination, as economists
as well as citizens, so to mold our economic arrangements, through
appropriate combinations of individual initiative and collective control,
as not only to safeguard the meritorious accomplishments of the past,
but to eliminate current maladjustments of major significance and to
move forward to new horizons. Our professional discussions of economic
policy are the counterpart of the widespread concern with policy mat-
ters voiced through innumerable channels in the community at large,
and they tend to reflect the dominant interests of economists in the
contemporary scene.
III
While it is a commonplace that public policy in economic affairs is
the result of the interaction of a great diversity of factors, discussions
of policy problems are all too frequently confined to the narrow limits,
more or less technically defined, of the particular issues immediately
under consideration. Not only are related economic elements of offset-
ting character sometimes ignored, but non-economic considerations are
often deemed to be altogether irrelevant. The age in which we live is
one of specialization; and because of the enormous expansion of the
field of knowledge, specialization naturally prevails in the intellectual
sphere as well as in other aspects of our highly developed social arrange-
ments. Immense good has issued of course from the labors of experts
in restricted segments of the broad realm of science and thought.
Without intensive activity by specialists in narrowly limited spheres of
investigation, the sweep and rapidity of our progress to knowledge and
understanding would be seriously impaired. In our own field, resort to
specialized, detailed, and incisive analyses of economic conditions and
of the interplay of economic forces is clearly indispensable. But con-
trolling reliance upon sharply departmentalized results, both within
and between special fields of inquiry, has its serious drawbacks,
particularly in relation to the development of public policy. For the
latter purpose the most pressing need, aside from the assembly of
adequate data and their subjection to competent analysis, is for in-
telligent and balanced synthesis of the numerous and often conflicting
factors involved. On the economic front, despite the constant pulling
and hauling of special groups for special advantage, the problem of
the effective functioning of the industrial system as a whole, partic-
ularly from the standpoint of the optimum utilization of material and
human resources without serious interruption, has tended to constitute
since the great depression the dominant concern of economic policy;
and this concern, if it is to issue in fruitful social adjustments, calls for
integrated knowledge and integrated thinking.


---Economics-1946-0-09.txt---
Furthermore, when the organization and operation of the social order
are viewed in the large, there is considerable kinship between the
underlying objectives of economists, sociologists, political scientists, and
students of the law. All are devoted to acquiring knowledge and insight
concerning human relationships as they develop within the framework
of organized society, with a view, in part at least, to advancing the
general welfare asi reflected from time to time in the unfolding aspira-
tions of the community. Each group deals with distinctive aspects of
social process, and each relies upon special expedients and techniques;
but the results of their explorations are part of a closely interrelated
whole. When these results are translated into institutional arrange-
ments through policy measures, those charged with responsibility for
the adoption of such measures cannot escape resort to coordination,
and they are as greatly in need of informed guidance in this aspect of
their labors as in having made available to them adequate and soundly
interpreted basic data in each distinctive sphere. This need of skilled
and disinterested coordination is all the more urgent because scientific
methods and scientific results can at best be only crudely approximated
in the field of social relations. Means and ends and the values condi-
tioning them are in process of constant flux; relevant data are always
less than complete or current; human beings display vigorous opposi-
tion to controlled experimentation; the range of predictability is
sharply restricted; the pertinent variables are so extensive as to result
inevitably in wide differences with respect to diagnoses and cures; and
consideration must be accorded to ultrarational or even irrational
factors as well as to those assumed to be grounded in reason. It is in
such circumstances that legal arrangements in the field of economic
policy are evolved.
IV
Public control of economic policy is predominantly crystallized into
law. Aside from the ultimate control assumed to be exercised by the
coinsuming public in a free market economy, there are, of course,
numerous informal public controls, consciously applied for the most
part, unless condemned by law, through the great variety of voluntary
associations into which our society is organized. The development of
a spirit of private restraint and a sense of public responsibility on the
part of major economic interests, whether acting independently or
through such associations, might well serve to minimize the need of
government intervention. But neither reliance upon automatic processes
nor the beneficence of voluntary action has proved to be an adequate
instrument for the elimination of specific economic abuses or the
achievement oif constructive economic purposes. In these circumstances


---Economics-1946-0-10.txt---
there has long been resort to governmental authority, in one sphere or
another, to protect particular interests or advance general well-being.
It is the complex of legal powers being exercised or sought which
brings to issue the outstanding controversies of the day in the field of
public policy. It is our prevailing system of law, the aggregate of gov-
ernmental prohibitions and requirements imposing restrictions upon
private enterprise and fashioning its character and direction, which
raises such fundamental questions as the appropriate scope of the
obligations of government to further economic welfare, the relation
between freedom and authority in the achievement of fruitful economic
results, the outlook for the preservation of democratic institutions in
the milieu of extensive public control of economic activity.
This legal system not only embraces the large accumulation of juridi-
cal principles and practices sanctioned or evolved at common law in the
piecemeal adjudication of disputes concerning the rights and duties of
private litigants, but includes also, more significantly for our present
purposes, the enormous mass of legislative enactments and adminis-
trative determinations-federal, state, and local-which, upon surviv-
ing the possibility of judicial censorship on constitutional grounds,
play an important role in the governance of economic behavior. While
this body of enactments and determinations, as interpreted by the
courts, ha.s modified common-law doctrines in numerous ways, its most
far-reaching contribution lies in positive supplementation of the com-
mon law, through the establishment of standards and the enforcement
of policies designed to safeguard and promote the common good.
However adverse a reaction may be justified to the wisdom or propriety
of particular measures, the basic objectives of the legal system as thus
developed reflect a popular determination to improve economic con-
ditions, within the general framework of private enterprise, and a faith
in the efficacy of collective control.
Law as such evokes no opposition whatever in our midst, even from
those who are most firmly convinced that the contemporary expansion
of the legal system is calculated to destroy or subvert our economic
and political institutions. Indeed, insistence upon the supremacy of
law is voiced most uniformly and most vigorously by those who are
generally inhospitable to restrictive change effected through collective
action. But the law thus approved is primarily that which strengthens
the very industrial setup which is in course of modification-the legal
rules and practices designed to protect property rights, enforce contract
obligations, provide monetary mechanisms, sustain corporate activity,
define bankruptcy procedures, reward creative accomplishment, per-
petuate special privileges. Even. in these spheres, however, which have
constituted the traditional legal foundations of economic conduct, a


---Economics-1946-0-11.txt---
process of continual development, in response to social pressures
resulting from practical maladjustments of all sorts, is both necessary
and unavoidable; and with the intensification of public consciousness
as to desirable ends and appropriate means, more positive objectives
are constantly emerging and being implemented-the powers and op-
portunities which inhere in our political democracy are being utilized
not only to advance special interests, but to further the deliberate
attainment of more general economic well-being.
The labors of economists would proceed on an unrealistic basis, and
would tend to be sterile in many respects, if adequate heed were not
given to the legal environment in which economic enterprise is organized
and economic forces operate; but it is even more important that the
controlling system of law should reflect adequately the economic en-
vironment in which its rules and standards and policies are applicable.
If law is to serve as a living instrument for the guidance of human
relationships in the economic sphere, it must necessarily embrace a
process of reasonable adjustment to social change; and, in point of fact,
the relative stability of our institutions is attributable in large measure
to the actual recognition of this principle of growth in our legal system.
Despite the existence at times of significant conflicts between law and
economics, involving especially undue lags in the development of con-
stitutional doctrine, even the large mass of common-law rules has been
fashioned progressively, though slowly, to accord with the demands of
our dynamic society; and the major measures of economic policy which
find expression in legislation and administration have come to constitute
an integral part of the prevailing body of law. By and large, at least as
of the present, the growth of our legal system is not being artificially or
unduly restricted by the individualistic traditions which surrounded the
early development of modern industrialism.
V
Both prevailing and proposed economic policies must be judged on
their merits, in light of all conditioning circumstances; and on this
basis economists have much to contribute toward the development of
sound and effective policy measures. The immediate sensitiveness of
economic conduct to indirect and remote influences, as well as the
long-run economic consequences of controls, must of necessity receive
informed consideration; and reasoned emphasis upon the broader
implications of economic policy, in their bearing upon our entire
institutional setup, also possesses a large measure of persuasive perti-
nence. In other words, we must not permit ourselves to, drift into an
essentially collectivistic economy. But when opposition to policy
measures is voiced in extreme terms-when virtually all significant


---Economics-1946-0-12.txt---
proposals are attacked as fundamentally subversive of our cherished
heritage the adoption of needed controls is sometimes retarded, and
what is even more important, the controls actually incorporated into
our legal system tend to be largely molded by their militant proponents,
whose advocacy is often equally extreme in the sweeping constructive
expectations which it holds forth. Since the precise character of controls
and the procedural safeguards surrounding them are not infrequently
more important than the mere fact of their establishment, this approach
comes to be a self-defeating one on the part of the regulated interests,
and the community at large tends to be deprived of the balancing
influence of those most immediately concerned and most intimately
acquainted with the complexities involved. It is one of the striking facts
of our economic history that, except in grave emergencies, commercial
and industrial interests have stubbornly opposed practically all restric-
tive or positive control measures of importance, usually on what they
professed to be fundamental legal and economic grounds, however
readily they may subsequently have adjusted themselves to the new
environment created by these measures. Among the more comprehensive
considerations that have thus been invoked in obstructing and impair-
ing the development of economic policy are those reflected in relatively
unrelieved stress upon the maintenance of individual freedom, in
condemnation of government as a virtually unmixed evil, in repudiation
of politics as a necessarily maleficent activity.
There is a substantial parallelism between undue emphasis upon
national sovereignty in international relations and a similar over-
emphasis of individual freedom in domestic relations. Both are
expressions of a basic isolationism in face of closely knit and
interdependent conditions of social living. There can be no question
that freedom from restraint, whether it be the external restraint of alien
states or the internal restraint of domestic governmental authority, is
among the most fundamental of our values and is largely responsible
for our fruitful accomplishments. But untrammeled freedom of action
has never prevailed in either sphere. It has always been recognized
that both national and individual liberty, if allowed uninhibited sway,
are themselves likely to generate serious restraints, and that deliberate
restrictions may be necessary to achieve the largest measure of attain-
able freedom. National sovereignty has not precluded ready acceptance
of the numerous self-imposed limitations contained in compacts or
treaties negotiated between states, nor has the individualism of our
system of private enterprise precluded the collective establishment of
numerous controls. When achieved through democratic processes, in
response to demonstrated general need, these measures of economic
control tend to implement and enrich individual freedom, just as


---Economics-1946-0-13.txt---
mutually advantageous international agreements constitute concrete
expressions of sovereignty rather than its denial.
We are now in the midst of a determined quest for durable peace
among nations and for economic security at home, and in connection
with this far-reaching effort the institutional implications of collective
control have come to sharp focus. But there appears to be no justifiable
basis for assuming that even these objectives are necessarily in conflict
with the maintenance of national sovereignty or individual freedom. The
goals are more positive and comprehensive than any previously sought
on so broad a foundation of popular support or with like insistence,
but they are being pursued for the most part within the established
structure of political nationalism and economic individualism. Effective
removal of the menace of war is essential to the constructive fruition
of national purposes; adequate concern with continuing maintenance
of a high level of production and employment is an indispensable
condition of economic welfare. Collective effort toward these major
ends, as generally envisaged, is but calculated to create a favoring
environment for national and individual self-realization. Fortunately
the obstacles to international cooperation springing from legalistic
conceptions of sovereignty are rapidly dissolving. In the domestic field
we are much more hesitant-for fear, basically, of undue encroach-
ment upon individual freedom. There are, without doubt, many pitfalls
and immense difficulties in interrelating soundly and fruitfully the great
variety of elements, public and private, relevant to the achievement of
economic stability at a prosperity level; and there is much room for
controversy with respect to numerous technical questions clustering
about wage adjustments, price policies, investment functions, monetary
management, fiscal practices, and a host of other complex factors. But
sweeping repudiation of public responsibility for economic stabilization
is largely a make-believe procedure; and the ready identification of all
public policies that may in some fashion be characterized as economic
planning with the exercise of dictatorial power and the use of arbitrary
methods-as inevitably involving authoritative allocation of resources
and imposition of direct controls over all significant aspects of the
economy-simply does not square with the character of prevailing
non-emergency controls, or of the relatively modest proposals being
sponsored, or likely to be sponsored, by any substantial and responsible
segment of our polity. Such an approach leads to reliance, not upon
documented economic dangers, but upon such emotion-laden and
question-begging shibboleths as "regimentation" and "centralization,"
broadcast with little reference to the inescapable dependence of the
individual upon social process, the essentially national scope of the
established economic system, the reasonably reassuring actualities in


---Economics-1946-0-14.txt---
these respects of the general course of control experience. It is neither
desirable nor feasible, in the complexities of modern industrial society,
to restrict governmental functions to a closed category fashioned by
the near-absolutes of a dead past.
Nor does greater validity attach to such strictures upion the develop-
ment of public control as derive their primary impulse from want of
confidence in government and politics. Governments can be and have
been arbitrary, discriminatory, and tyrannical; and it is a sound
instinct that seeks to restrict government intervention in econonmic
affairs to the compelling requirements of public interest, centered upon
the gradual but progressive improvement of the lot of the individual.
But in a democratic society such collective requirements cannot be
indefinitely ignored; and only government provides a sufficiently all-
inclusive instrument to encompass and represent the entire community
in the totality of its economic relations. In time of war we dedicate our
lives and all our resources to a vital common end, and we rely upon
government unstintingly to effectuate this end. Common ends of great
significance also emerge in times of peace, and in the economic sphere
control policies, molded by the spiecific exigencies of recurring need,
constitute practical expressions of such collective purposes. Whether
in peace or war, particular measures may be ill-adapted to the ends held
in view, and may indeed prove positively harmful. Furthermore, the
exercise of governmental authority may be impaired or vitiated by
corrupt practices and inefficient methods. But such defects of govern-
ment, occasionally resulting in situations sufficiently extreme to be
termed scandalous, have their counterparts in the administration of
private business enterprise; and in any event, the remedy lies in the
improvement of government in all its various branches-a widely
recognized need which becomes increasingly urgent as the scope of
public control is expanded-rather than in the artificial restriction of
governmental functions.
And like observations appear to be justified with respect to reliance
upon the shortcomings of politics as a ground for resisting necessary
controls. The unlovely aspects of politics are common knowledge and
need not be detailed here. Improvement in political methods is as
essential as improvement in government as a whole. But in considerable
measure politics is government in action; and politics can no more be
wished out of existence, or be regarded as an inherent obstacle to the
adoption of needed control measures, than government itself. Moreover,
the significant constructive services rendered by politics in the sphere
of policy-making are generally overlooked. The often alarming activities
of pressure groups tend in many instances to offset one another; and it
is political rivalry, animated in some degree by divergent faiths and at


---Economics-1946-0-15.txt---
all events by distinctive strategies, that is largely responsible for
keeping selfish interests in most cases within relatively reasonable
bounds. There are, of course, fundamental issues of principle that call
for uncompromising statesmanship, impervious to the temptations of
political maneuvering. The maintenance of government as the servant
of the people, through vigilant avoidance of policies calculated to
transform the state into their master, constitutes the most outstanding
of these issues and comprehends numerous matters of principle where
political concessions are dangerous. Happily we have resisted the lure
of totalitarianism even under the terrific pressures of the great economic
breakdown and the unprecedented upheaval of world war; and with
the complete military defeat of the fascist powers the climate of opinion
is more inhospitable than ever to the enthronement of dictatorial
authority. In most economic matters, however, there is ample room for
accommodation of conflicting interests and conflicting viewpoints; and
the pragmatic compromises of politics produce such accommodation.
Politics thus serves as a cementing rather than divisive influence in our
national life. Head-on collisions between powerful interests and extreme
ideologies are thereby averted, and opportunity is afforded for resort
to limited and tentative expedients, often instituted on an experimental
basis, which are subject to progressive modification as practical
circumstances may require. The trial-and-error methods by which the
Interstate Commerce act and the interpretation and application of its
provisions have been evolved over a, period of almost six decades furnish
a striking illustration of this pragmatic approach; and similar methods
have characterized for the most part the development of control policies
in all spheres of economic activity. Needed change may be somewhat
retarded in this way, but it tends to assume the form of much more
orderly and realistic adjustments than if pursued as a quest for
uncompromising ends, to be effectuated in full-blown maturity by single
impulse. In this fashion the very political activity which is so often
feared and so generally condemned has contributed significantly,
despite the accumulation of controls, to the preservation of the essential
attributes of the system of private capitalism.
VI
But perhaps the most common alarm over the influence being
exerted upon the system of private enterprise by the development of
public control finds expression in the contention that we are relinquish-
ing our liberties to an all-pervading "bureaucracy." This characteriza-
tion of governmental policies as bureaucracy is obviously a mere use
of epithet, designed to cast discredit upon existing and proposed control
measures, rather than an objective description of regulatory procedures.


---Economics-1946-0-16.txt---
Indeed, one is seldom given any inkling as to what constitutes the essence
of bureaucracy, or where the line may be drawn between legitimate and
bureaucratic governmental activity. For the most part the charge of
bureaucracy but epitomizes over-all recalcitrance to control, lumping
in a single blast of condemnation the great variety of considerations,
largely substantive in character, which usually impel attacks upon
government intervention in the economic sphere. Much of the distrust
is based, of course, upon justifiable complaint against inefficient
administration resulting from poor choice of personnel and lack of
discipline, against slowness of action arising from cumbersome and
hierarchical assignments of responsibility, against self-perpetuating and
self-aggrandizing activities of public appointees. As already noted,
removal or mitigation of such governmental and political defects is, and
should be, a matter of deep concern. But aside from these general
strictures upon government and politics, and to the extent that regula-
tory processes rather than the policies to be enforced are at issue, it
must be assumed that the critical emphasis upon bureaucracy springs
from the fact that our prevailing governmental establishment operates
predominantly in economic matters through boards, bureaus, and
commissions. From this standpoint it is the administrative method of
control, as reflected in the nature of the majo;r regulatory agencies,
which is assumed to threaten our liberties.
Administrative tribunals have come into being and have expanded
with the years because they provide "working implements of govern-
ment," to use a phrase of Chief Justice Stone, which are indispensable
to the successful attainment of regulatory ends. Exclusive reliance upon
the courts would but give effect to customary common-law rules,
constituting a virtual abdication of positive policy making in face of
urgent need of control in many directions; and even within these narrow
limits such judicial activity would result in the mere provision of private
redress for past infringements upon prevailing obligations, rather than
in the affirmative establishment of such relationships as are deemed to
be required in the public interest. In these circumstances resort to
statutory enactments has been a necessary and natural expression of
democratic objectives in the complexities of the modern world. But
direct legislative regulation, enforceable in the courts, while entirely
appropriate where concretely definable prohibitions are involved, is
likewise beset with vitiating difficulties in most instances. Legislatures,
do not possess the necessary competence to deal in detail with the
numerous and intricate economic matters over which they may exercise
jurisdiction. Many practices subject to control-such as unfair methods
of competition and unreasonable or unjustly discriminatoiry rates and
charges-are not adequately definable, even as prohibitions, without


---Economics-1946-0-17.txt---
reference to the facts of individual situations. When remedial ends are
being sought, as in most aspects of contemporary control, legislative
policies must be adapted to a tremendous diversity of circumstances
and conditions. And direct legislative controls, however soundly
formulated in the first instance, would tend to issue in harmfully rigid
adjustments. It is because of such factors that the administrative
tribunal has come to be utilized as the dominant instrument of regula-
tion. Basic policies and guiding standards are prescribed by the
legislature; but the task of translating these policies and standards into
specific regulatory requirements is entrusted to administrative com-
missions, fuctioning continuously and aided by technical staffs, which
promulgate their orders, after notice and hearing, on the basis of factual
records as developed in each proceeding, and whose determinations
are subject to judicial review. While there are minor variations from
these primary characteristics among the many permanent regulatory
bodies now operative, and while the pressures of emergency situations
have temporarily induced procedural short-cuts as well as extraordinary
extensions of public authority, this type of agency constitutes the
established norm for the control of economic conduct.
It is important to remember that this method of administrative
regulation represents no new device fashioned during the recent period
of intense control activity. State commissions with mandatory power
over railroads were first established in the 1870's; and in the federal
sphere the Interstate Commerce Commission, the most powerful of all
our peacetime administrative agencies exercising direct economic
control, dates back to 1887. The creation of this commission constituted
a deliberate Congressional choice over the alternative method of
legislative regulation, and the long intervening experience has but served
to confirm the wisdom of the choice. While numerous controversies have
developed in the course of the Commission's existence concerning the
nature and scope of the substantive policies to be established for its
guidance, there has been no disagreement as to the indispensability of
the administrative method for effectuating these policies, and there
has been no weakening of this conviction as the Commission's powers
have actually been expanded in notable degree. By the time of the
outbreak of the First World War, virtually all the states had constituted
administrative agencies, modeled upon the Interstate Commerce
Commission, fo-r the regulation of public utilities, and the Federal Trade
Commission had been established to regulate competitive practices and
implement our antitrust policy in the general field of commerce and
industry. By that time, furthermore, a full generation ago, the develop-
ing system of administrative law had been absorbed without serious
difficulty into our over-all legal framework. This was accomplished by a


---Economics-1946-0-18.txt---
Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice White, which in the
contemporary disposition to affix labels would generally be deemed to
have been conservative. Not only were attacks upon the regulatory
commissions on the ground of unconstitutional delegation of legislative
authority succesisfully repelled, but by the adoption in self-denial of a
narrow judicial review, the courts gave full effect to the large grants of
administrative discretion vested in these agencies. It was recognized
that the ever-present conflict between rule and discretion, arising from
the need under varying circumstances of according consideration to the
often divergent demands of certainty and of justice, is characteristic
of judicial as well as administrative determinations; and in view of
the essential regulatory purposes being served and the manifest legis-
lative intent that dominant responsibility for effectuating them be
vested in these specialized agencies, no inherent derogation from the
supremacy of law was found to be involved in the functioning of the
administrative tribunals. It was this established legal doctrine that
determined the status and potentialities of most of the subsequently
created regulatory commissions.
The attacks upon so-called "bureaucracy" as a process of control
spring chiefly from fear of the exercise of arbitrary power. When
adequate safeguards are provided against unjustifiable or capricious
action, it is the control policies themselves rather than the methods of
their execution that are really brought into question; and in our system
of administrative regulation such safeguards are in fact provided in a
good many ways by the legislatures, the agencies themselves, and the
courts. The regulatory commissions are created by the legislatures, and
their very existence, no less than the sufficiency of their resources, is
constantly subject to the legislative will. The fields of their operation
and the scope of their power, including applicable policies and
standards, are expressly prescribed. Responsibility for proper per-
formance of their regulatory functions runs directly to the legislatures,
with provision for periodic public accountability to them. The entire
structure of control in each sphere is thus subject to continual
modification on the basis of experience. In the exercise of their
authority, furthermore, the regulatory agencies are generally required
to provide due notice to all interests involved and to afford them full
and fair hearings. These agencies are frequently referred to as quasi-
judicial tribunals, because, as an incident to the performance of their
primary function of prescribing arrangements for the future, they
necessarily pass upon the propriety of existing adjustments. Much
more important is the fact that they usually follow quasi-judicial
procedures. These procedures arouse dissatisfaction on the part of those
who impatiently seek quick results through summary action, but they


---Economics-1946-0-19.txt---
provide necessary assurance that all relevant private rights and
interests will be accorded due consideration in the fashioning of
determinations deemed to further the public good. The validity of these
administrative determinations, finally, is subject to review by the courts.
While judicial review generally confines itself to mere questions of
power, and does not seek to substitute the judgment of the courts for
that of the regulatory bodies, it provides effective safeguards against
unconstitutional assertions of power, both in the governing legislative
policies and in the resulting administrative orders, against exercise of
administrative authority not supported by valid interpretation of the
pertinent statutory enactments, and against abuse of administrative
discretion effected through any failure to adhere to due process, broadly
conceived, as evolved in the established traditions of the law. The
regulatory agencies are thus kept within the bounds of legitimate
authority deliberately vested in them. Arbitrary power and arbitrary
action are both alien to the prevailing peacetime system of administra-
tive regulation.
Under such a system, however, it is a matter of crucial importance
that the independence of the regulatory agencies be meticulously
maintained. Only in this way can the characteristic advantages of the
administrative method be realized. It is especially necessary that these
tribunals be not dominated by political pressures. Political influences
have their proper place in the development of guiding policies through
legislative action; but in the execution of these policies as established
by law, the responsible administrative bodies must be free to, reach
determinations based entirely upon their own informed judgment. Such
freedom from external influence or control is as essential in this sphere
as in case of the determinations of the courts. It conditions the attain-
ment of just results in particular proceedings and the preservation of
needed confidence in the regulatory process as a whole. The established
setup is in point of fact one of independent commissions; and when
political interference makes itself felt, as it does in a variety of ways
from time to time, it at least tends to evoke adverse popular reactions,
because of manifest departure from the generally accepted norm of
administrative independence. The plausible proposals that are put for-
ward recurrently for the absorption of the regulatory agencies by the
regular departments of government constitute a much more serious
threat. It would be difficult, in such a setup, to divorce specific
administrative determinations, no less than general matters of guiding
policy, from the political objectives of the party in power; and in these
circumstances the orderly safeguards against arbitrary or capricious
action which have been laboriously developed over the years would
tend, as a practical matter, to be seriously impaired. A like danger


---Economics-1946-0-20.txt---
appears to lurk in proposals for instituting special-interest representa-
tion on the regulatory agencies themselves, as in case of the tri-partite
board for handling labor disputes and wage stabilization during the war
period. However helpful this form of organization may have proved to
be in facilitating the disposition of industrial conflicts in the special
emergency situations with which we were then faced, it did not
contribute to the maintenance of orderly processes or the development
of enduring principles. All interests involved in regulatory proceedings
should, as a matter of course, be accorded full opportunity to present
evidence and argument bearing upon every aspect of the problems at
issue; but since the very fact of government intervention springs from
the recognition of a general interest that transcends the special interests
of the parties, the process of decision should be entrusted exclusively to
public representatives. In other words, internal as well as external
pressures may constitute an impediment to the maintenance of genuine
administrative independence.
But in the last analysis the most far-reaching safeguards against
possible excesses of public control, whether they be substantive or
procedural in character, lie in 'the preservation of the democratic
environment of governmental action. Important control policies usually
draw their initial impetus from expressions of popular dissatisfaction
with existing conditions. At least in general terms proposed measures
tend to be discussed in political campaigns and to bear upon the
fortunes of political parties and candidates. In due course they are
investigated by legislative committees and debated in the law-making
chambers. After control measures are adopted they are likely to be
tested in the courts as to 'their constitutional validity and legal scope.
They are then executed and enforced by the regulatory agencies,
generally under quasi-judicial procedures, and the findings and
conclusions of the investigations are public records. Individual
determinations and directives are subject to judicial review, for abuse
of administrative discretion, and the entire regulatory performance is
subject to virtually unrestricted legislative inquiry. When patent im-
proprieties or unacceptable results emerge, the law-making bodies have
constantly recurring opportunity to reverse or modify or expand prevail-
ing policies and practices; and the whole deliberative cycle may again be
brought into play. After due allowance is made for the large measure of
unreality that often characterizes public discussions of public issues,
as well as for the obstacles to relinquishment of established control
arrangements that derive from vested governmental interests, serious
errors of economic policy cannot in the long run withstand the pressure
of these democratic processes. As long as we exercise the necessary
vigilance to preserve without impairment our political liberties, includ-


---Economics-1946-0-21.txt---
ing free and frequent elections, and our civil liberties of freedom of
thought, of speech, and of the press, there is little likelihood that the
course of government intervention will be permitted to subvert our
essentially individualistic economic order.
The chief purpose of these observations has been to direct attention
to some of the factors that obstruct the approach to policy problems.
The ends sought are of vital significance, and the tasks actually to be
performed are many and difficult. Despite the movement for public
control, long in the making and far advanced in many directions-
perhaps because of it-our economy remains the outstanding expression
of private enterprise in the world of today. There is a deep-rooted faith
in the system and a widespread determination that it be preserved. It is
doubtful whether prophecies of doom are any better founded for the
future than they have been in the past. There appears to be good
promise that freedom and authority can be so harmonized as to promote
economic well-being without sacrifice of essential values.

According to Victorian reckoning, this is the Diamond Jubilee of the
American Economic Association. In the charter of incorporation of this
Association its purposes are stated as follows: "(1) The encouragement
of economic research . . . (2) The issue of publications on economic sub-
jects, and (3) The encouragement of perfect freedom of economic discus-
sion. The Association as suck [italics supplied] will take no partisan
attitude, nor will it commit its members to anv position on practical
economic questions."
Admirable purposes and principles. In pursuing them the Association,
over the sixty years of its life, has rendered invaluable service to the
profession. It has offered an opportunity for economists to present their
ideas to colleagues and to have these ideas discussed at the meetings.
It has enabled members through the Proceedings and the Review, to
keep in touch with the work and thinking of fellow-members. It has
also-and this perhaps has been its greatest service-offered an oppor-
tunity for many members to get together once a year and to become
acquainted with each other. It has created a degree of esprit de corps
among economists.
But it has remained aloof from practical affairs. It has been academic,
though in the fine, not the derogatory, sense of the word. In the mean-
time profound changes have occurred in the life of the country. Not only
has the elimination of time and space from travel and communications
made all decisions necessarily more urgent and decisive, but the growth of
economic units and the concentration of economic power have imparted
to a vastly larger proportion of public and private actions a nation-
wide, nay, a world-wide significance. The United States can no longer
remain complacently aloof behind the oceans, nor the economist behind
the book stacks. An economist"s study can no longer be his world; the
entire world must be his study.
To an ever-growing extent public authorities and national and inter-
national business enterprises turn to economists for advice and guid-


---Economics-1947-0-02.txt---
ance; and economists in increasing numbers seek partial or total em-
ployment outside of academic halls. There are many economists who,
like other thinkers, remain aloof and follow their own thoughts in an
arduous effort to discover the eternal verities. The world needs these
men and the profession is proud of them, for every important practical
forward step in the progress of humanity has had its origin in the ab-
stract, supposedly impractical thinking and dreaming of the scholar; the
physicist, biologist, philosopher, and student of social problems.
The closet thinker may be compared to the scientist who invents and
perfects means of achieving military and industrial objectives; other
economists may be likened to the military or industrial army who must
utilize the results of the thinking of the scientist in helping to solve the
problems of the day. Both phases of the economists' work are necessary
to society; the profession has a responsibility for developing both kinds
of economists-the thinker and the doer. But while it may be feasible
for the thinker not to be a doer, it would be fatal for the doer to refrain
from thinking.
It should be recognized that for many, if not for most, economists
the quiet and peace of the ivory tower has been lost; the confusion and
struggle of the market place is upon them. Many have gone to work
there, and have rendered yeoman service to the economy and the state.
But they have done so as individuals, for they have had little, if any,
organized support from their colleagues in the Association, little facil-
ity for sounding the trends of thought among their fellow workers.
Some method should be devised by which the public, and more particu-
larly members of the Association, could find out how the economists
of the country stood on important issues. One way to promote this would
be to create a small committee on Public Issues. Such a committee could
select issues on which the views of members would be sought. It could
take responsibility for wording the questions, calling for assistance on
persons best qualified to give it. The entire Association, or the portion
of it which might be expected to know most about the subject, would
then be circularized. After the replies had been received, the Secretary
of the Association would issue a statement to the effect that the 4000
members of the American Economic Association have been asked a cer-
tain question; of this number-so many replied; of the replies-so many
took one view, and so many another. This could be refined by classifying
the replies geographically, by field of interest, and in other ways. Such
a statement would not commit the Association as such to any viewpoint,
and therefore would not violate the letter or the spirit of its charter. But
it would enable the public to know currently how the profession stood
on an issue and would give economists themselves a way of knowing
better what other members of their craft were thinking.


---Economics-1947-0-03.txt---
An incidental, but not unimportant, advantage of such a procedure
would be that it would counteract the effect of pronouncements on con-
troversial questions appearing from time to time, attributed to a stated
number of economists. For many reasons such statements are not the
best way for economists to voice their views. There is no way of judging
whether those who are quoted represent a prevailing or a minority
opinion. The questions on which the views are expressed are not selected
by a representative group-but are usually propounded by an energetic
individual who wants to gather support for his position. Not infre-
quently the issues presented are minor from the viewpoint of the public
interest. Also, because of their unidentified origin and the unsystematic
selection of signers (at least as far as the public knows), such pronounce-
ments are likely to be taken as propaganda efforts by an interested
group. Finally, in practice the questions are often ambiguously worded
and do not offer a good opportunity of indicating clear-cut views on well-
defined issues. Experience shows that occasional pronouncements of this
sort, well intentioned and public spirited as their objectives may be,
have done nothing in most cases to enhance the prestige of the profes-
sion-but, on the contrary, have tended to bring it under suspicion of
being either unrealistic or influenced by some pressure group.
From the point of view of the Association, this is important because
statements by a substantial number of its members are likely to be in-
terpreted by some as expressing the views of the profession as a whole,
or of the Association itself. This is prejudicial to its interests and to those
of the vast majority of its less vocal members. Clearly the Association
would not wish and is not in a position to do anything to interfere with
the freedom of its members to express themselves publicly in any way
they choose. That is their privilege, and one consistent with the texture
of democratic ideas. But while nothing can be done to prevent such
statements or to discourage them, the establishment of official polls
would go a long way toward counteracting their harmful effect on the
standing of the profession.
There are many issues on which there is practical unanimity among
economists, while public opinion is widely divided. There are others, it
is rumored, on which agreement has not been reached even among mem-
bers of the profession. Clarification of the issues and focusing attention
of the members on them would result in making many members feel a
greater sense of their urgency and to induce them to review and organize
their thinking in relation to the realities of the day in fields not confined
to their immediate specialty.
At no time has it been more important for economists to have the
respect and confidence of the public, or more necessary for the country

vision of economists. For society today is confronted with a vital issue.
What must be decided in the immediate future is whether an answer to
pressing economic problems can be found within the framework of capi-
talism and free enterprise or whether economic organization must move
in the direction of socialism or communism, or whether a combination
of the two systems offers the best solution. These alternatives involve
political, moral and spiritual dilemmas, but the fundamental question
is economic: shall enterprise continue largely under private ownership,
or shall it be increasingly or wholly turned over to the state? From the
socialist or communist point of view, the important questions appear to
have been solved-many decades ago, while for protagonists of private
enterprise answers to the questions are still to be developed. Communism
places a period after its dogmas, in fact, an exclamation point, while a
question mark is still discernible at the end of deliberations on economic
dilemmas by proponents of individual enterprise. This appears to give
the communist approach the advantage of certainty, and leaves capital-
ism under the apparent handicap of indecision. But in the long term,
free enterprise may gain the more important advantage of greater flexi-
bility, which makes it more adaptable to changing economic forces. Its
opportunities are many, the challenge of events is vibrant, and all in-
tellectual resources must be directed toward meeting it.
In this critical hour the economist and his Association have a great
opportunity and a corresponding responsibility. On the discharge of this
responsibility depends not merely the standing and future of the pro-
fession-but a vastly more important issue as well-the form of future
economic life. For if economists cannot devise a way of making a system
of free enterprise produce results satisfactory to the mass of the people,
it is certain that the trend will be away from free enterprise and toward
some form of socialist state; and while experience has not shown con-
clusively that a socialist state can tolerate spiritual freedom-which
democracies value above all, neither has it been demonstrated that so-
cialism must necessarily be totalitarian and is irreconcilable with free-
dom.
In the critical period ahead, when these questions must be answered
by events, economists and their Association are under obligation more
than ever to help in the development of correct solutions to pressing
problems that confront the economy. On the development of such solu-
tions and their incorporation into national and international economic
policy of this country depends the progress of world reconstruction. For
without the maintenance of economic strength in the United States and
its use for rehabilitating the world, there is little hope for the future of
western civilization.
The suggested method of testing the views of economists might be


---Economics-1947-0-05.txt---
one helpful step. Other ways of strengthening the profession's grip on
reality need to be developed. Most of the members of this Association
are not only economic thinkers but teachers as well. Promotion of better
understanding of economic problems by future men of affairs and states-
men is not the least of the economists' obligations. But the economics
they teach must reflect understanding of the forces that shape the chang-
ing economic world.
Economists, therefore, are under double obligation-for themselves
and for their disciples-to perfect their implements and processes of
thinking. They must beware of dogmas; avoid blind faith in free enter-
prise, in the all-curing beneficence of the entrepreneur's profit dollar
without reference to the source whence it is drawn or the use to which it
is put; as well as refrain from sole reliance on the hydraulic strength of
the income stream, or the salutory nature of the dollar spent by the con-
sumer, regardless of who he may be or the rationality or wastefulness of
his expenditure. They must subject to searching analysis the effects of
outlays by the state, the investor, the producer, and the consumer. They
must be conscious of the importance of all four phases of national in-
come: its source, its magnitude, its distribution, and its use. Likewise
they must not fall into the error of depending on the quantity of money
alone as an adequate regulator of economic developments, or adopt the
reverse doctrine that the amount of money is an unimportant and irrele-
vant condition with little or no bearing on prices or the course of events.
No set of statistical series, to say nothing of any single series, is a
sufficient basis for determining causal relationships on which economic
policy can be predicated with safety. They are only indications of where
one should look for the causes and interrelationships that determine eco-
nomic events. When it is said that statistics are the economist's con-
science, what is meant is that they indicate the limits of the territory
in which the economist may tread with assurance on the hard surface
of fact. They do not restrict his freedom of exploration in the less easily
traveled lanes of intelligent surmise and imaginative understanding. A
good economist need not be a seer but he must not wear blinders; and
he must have the seeing eye.
In order to perform their function adequately, economists must ad-
here rigidly to the discipline of thorough analysis of conditions as they
are and not permit themselves to be blinded by preconceived theories or
by transitory considerations of expediency. Lasting economic health
would not be achieved by sole dependence on the encouragement or
limitation of savings or on the promotion of adequate investment or
consumption; or on the expansion and contraction of the supply of
money. Great leaders who, under the stress of current conditions, have
evolved systems of economic concepts modify, expand, or alter these


---Economics-1947-0-06.txt---
concepts under different circumstances and as their own thinking pro-
gresses. Followers must be on the alert not to become more royalist than
the King.
If economics is the study of man in the process of producing and con-
suming what he needs and what he wants, then it is apparent that the
subject matter of his inquiry is constantly shifting. Not so many years
ago no one needed or wanted gasoline because the motor car had not been
invented, and no one wanted moving pictures or radios because they
had not yet been imagined. A horse-and-buggy economist in a motor
age is of no greater use than an isolationist in the atomic era. An econo-
mist, in order to merit this designation, must keep his mind open to the
realities of the ever changing pattern of economic life. When his thinking
becomes rigidly confined by a set of unchanging dogmas, his usefulness
rapidly declines while the amount of mischief he may do becomes for-
midable.
The success of the economists' efforts, however, even if they do their
best, will depend on the behavior of the different economic groups which
make up society and on effective organization of the state. But, while
progress in the rationality of the behavior of economic units is neces-
sarily a slow process to which understanding of economic forces can
contribute a great deal but only gradually in the course of time, better
adaptation of the machinery of government to the tasks it must perform
in modern society is an essential preliminary step long overdue in the
upward climb toward a smoothly functioning economy.
For progess on this road better organization of the government, more
direct and effective ways of translating programs into action must be
devised and instituted. Democracy, it has been said, is the rule of medi-
ocrity. There is an element of truth in the allegation. For mediocrity
represents the average, and a rule of the majority cannot be too far re-
moved from the understanding of the average. While leadership in a
democracy must remain in touch with the average, it should strive to
be ahead. It should lead-not follow. Leadership that is below the aver-
age is disastrous; leadership that is on the level of the average holds
little promise of advancement. Leadership that is ahead of the average
results in progress. It may make all the difference between a rise and a
decline in the tide of a nation's life.
Consequently, government must be so organized as to encourage bet-
ter than average leadership and assure it of the country's support. This
is the opposite of what actually prevails. It is regrettably true that exist-
ing governmental organization is such as to make it well nigh impossible
even for brilliant leadership to achieve progress, except at times of crisis
and then only at great hazard and with much delay.
We have a Congress which has great powers and is controlled by one


---Economics-1947-0-07.txt---
of the two leading political parties. The position of Congressmen on
vital issues, however, is not determined by their party allegiance. The
economic views of progressive Democrats, for example, are much farther
removed from those of conservative Democrats than those of individual
progressives or conservatives of either party are from each other. This
is so well known that it is almost a platitude. And yet, at the risk of
platitudinousness, it needs to be restated because of less obvious im-
plications. For this means that in choosing a member of Congress the
voter has no assurance that the party designation of his candidate in-
sures his taking certain positions, even on vital issues. Unless the voter
knows the views of a candidate on a variety of problems, he votes in the
dark. Some system under which the platform on which a party is elected
to office will indicate the line of policy that its individual members are
pledged to carry out is an essential part of a rational and effective de-
mocracy. We have no such system. It is imperative that one be estab-
lished. With such a system in effect, pressure groups representing special
interests would have considerably less opportunity to influence legisla-
tive action.
In the course of time terms of office of Congressmen should be so
modified as to make impossible the frustration and stalling of govern-
ment that occurs when the majority of Congress belongs to a different
party from that of the executive. This, however, would require an
amendment to the constitution and would be a slow process. The ur-
gency of such an improvement in legislative machinery is obscured by
the lack of likemindedness within the parties. It is significant and hope-
ful, on the other hand, that many of the other changes most urgently
required for rationalizing government can be accomplished not only
within the existing terms of the constitution but for the most part even
without legislation-by the adoption of effective practices and the es-
tablishment of a tradition of responsibility in government.
Recent improvements in the internal organization of Congress under
the La Follette bill are important steps in the right direction and hold a
promise of better functioning of the legislature. But in order to serve
the purposes of democracy adequate means must be devised to make
Congress a more effective instrument for carrying out the will of the
electorate. A machinery of government under which the President and
members of Congress, who were elected at the same time on the same
platform and have the same party allegiance and the same mandate
from the people, cannot cooperate on major issues is one that frustrates
the democratic process.
Coordinate with Congress stands the executive, with powers derived
in part from Congress and in part directly from the constitution. To
function effectively it must have organized machinery for co6peration


---Economics-1947-0-08.txt---
with Congress. Experience has demonstrated that voluntary, irregular
contacts are not enough. A regular statutory line of authority between
the executive and the legislative arms of the government is needed.
The executive itself should be so organized as to be in a position to
initiate programs expressive of broad national policy, and when ap-
proved by Congress, to carry them out as a co6rdinated undertaking-
through the different parts into which the executive branch of the gov-
ernment is subdivided. As the government is constituted, there was
until recently no agency for formulating national policies, no provision
for regular consultation with the legislative power, and no machinery
for co6rdinating the activities of the ten regular departments and the
numerous independent agencies, boards and commissions. The only
place where the power of coordination is lodged under the existing sys-
tem is the White House. And as a consequence, too much responsibility,
too much detailed work, and too much omniscience is expected of one
man-the President, who, in order to discharge the superhuman duties
piled upon him, needs to be a paragon of physical endurance, of wisdom,
energy, tact, and showmanship, as well as of political strategy. The re-
sult is that Presidents are killed by overwork and yet can rarely achieve
a complete and continuous program of national policy.
For the President does not have the support of a Cabinet with joint
responsibility for national policy. Such a Cabinet does not exist in this
country. There is only a group of men, charged with specific duties in
separate fields, with the President alone as a unifying and reconciling
factor. The extent to which problems of national policy are discussed at
Cabinet meetings is not generally known. But that there is no recogni-
tion of joint responsibility for adopting policy is clear. It is also apparent
that there are jealousies and a constant jockeying for power. Further-
more, many of the most important functions of the Executive are en-
trusted to agencies not represented at the Cabinet table at all-and
subject to no control except by remote direction of Congress and infre-
quent contacts with the over-worked and necessarily inaccessible Chief
Executive. The course of government may be pictured as an obstacle
race-beset by many hurdles and run simultaneously on many courses,
with but one judge who is under pressure to look in all directions at once
and to make prompt decisions of vital importance, without opportunity
in many instances to consider comprehensively all the elements in-
volved. This system is a heritage of a past era, when the duties of fed-
eral government were infinitely simpler. It needs to be remodeled in
order to be equipped to handle effectively the numerous pressing prob-
lems of a modern state. It has been well said that every human institu-
tion must change if it is to last. It would be tragic if at this critical time
the country's efforts to achieve domestic and world reconstruction were
frustrated by worship at the shrine of vested error.


---Economics-1947-0-09.txt---
This country abandoned traditional laissez-faire largely because re-
current booms and depressions had demonstrated the inefficiency of
unregulated private enterprise, its inability to cope with the problems
of a complex society. If government in turn shows itself incapable of
dealing effectively with these problems, then in what direction will the
country move? Will it be toward communism, fascism or anarchy? There
is little solace for America in any of these alternatives. Preservation of
democracy is the country's wish, but if democracy is to be preserved, it
must function efficiently. Its ideals must be implemented and made
secure by governmental machinery capable of carrying out the people's
will effectively and without undue delay.
The need for better organization of policy formation has been recog-
nized for a long time and its urgency has become more apparent during
the great depression of the thirties and during and after the Second
World War. Its acuteness has not abated but increased during the pres-
ent period of reconstruction.
One important move toward better coordination of government ac-
tivities was taken when the Act putting into effect the Bretton Woods
Agreements provided for a National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems to consist of the Secretaries of the
Treasury, State, and Commerce, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, and the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. This Council has
the function of considering with the American representatives on the
International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development the general policies to be pursued by the
United States in the field of international finance, and particularly mat-
ters in which decisions of these two institutions are subject to approval
by the United States. The Council is directed to coordinate, so far as
practicable, the policies and operations of the representatives of the
United States on the Fund, the Bank, the Export-Import Bank, and all
other agencies of the government engaging in foreign financial trans-
actions. It is required to make periodic reports to the President and to
the Congress. Since its organization the Council has been extremely ac-
tive and has represented the United States in negotiations in connection
with the British credit and the loans to France. Formal organization of
interdepartmental cooperation in international finance through this
Council is a constructive development of a high order of importance
and promise.
A potentially more important step was the adoption, after much dis-
cussion and debate, of a law, known as the Employment Act of 1946,
approved by the President on February 20, 1946. This date may mark
the first step in the process of rationalizing the government on an overall
basis and organizing American democracy to fit modern conditions. The
Act, in effect, declares it to be the continuing policy of the federal gov-


---Economics-1947-0-10.txt---
ernment to encourage opportunities of employment for all who are will-
ing and able to work, and to promote employment, production, and
purchasing power. In form the law deals primarily with one aspect of
economic life, employment, but the different facets of economic ac-
tivity are so interrelated that a successful policy assuring continuous
employment would require and assure stability of production, prices,
and other phases of life as well. The statute is couched in negotiated
language, representing compromises between different points of view.
Perhaps this should make it easier for its administrators to command
broad support. It is beyond doubt that the Act provides a foundation
for co6rdinated national economic policy.
It requires the President to transmit to Congress every year at the
opening of the session, an economic report covering in substance all
important phases of the nation's economic life, together with a program
of action. In addition, the President may from time to time transmit
supplementary reports.
The Act sets up a Council of Economic Advisers to assist the Presi-
dent in the formulation of his economic reports. It also creates a Joint
Committee of Congress to receive these reports and to make studies of
its own, and on this basis to transmit to the Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives its own reports containing its findings and recommendations.
This Act contains, in embryo, what is necessary to start the govern-
ment on a road to more effective action. It recognizes the unity of the
problems handled by the different departments and agencies, it gives the
President the kind of help and support that he requires and is entitled to
in the discharge of his great responsibilities, and it improves the proce-
dure for co6peration between the executive and the legislative branches of
government. A stronger and more formal link must be forged in the near
future, but the present law represents a step in the right direction.
This statute has been enacted so recently and the Economic Council
has been constituted for so short a time that it is too early to judge of its
effectiveness in actual operation. Its possibilities, however, are far reach-
ing; it needs the support of all citizens, and more particularly of this
Association, whose former president has been appointed as chairman of
the Council. The country cannot afford to have this promising start be-
come lost in the mazes of official red tape, or in conflicts for power
among agencies. It must become the beacon light leading toward a new
and more adequate machinery of government in a democracy.
The Council is at present in the experimental stage. On how it is de-
veloped and how much importance it gains in shaping the country's
economic policy will depend whether it will signalize a momentous step
forward in the democratic process or merely the emergence of another
in a long series of agencies issuing reports.


---Economics-1947-0-11.txt---
Programs worked out by the Council must be so realistic and convinc-
ing, so well thought out and adapted to the country's needs, so thorough
and so practical as to win acceptance, in whole or in large part, by the
President. His report to Congress, prepared in the light of the Council's
recommendations, would then be such as to enlist the support of public
opinion. Congress and the Executive should then stand together for the
enactment and administration of such laws and policies as the country's
needs demand.
There are in this possibilities of gradual but vital improvement in
our economic life. If the Reports become established as the recognized
authoritative basis of action-the recommendations would become bind-
ing on all heads of government departments and agencies. There would
be less bickering, misunderstanding, and cross-purposes between
branches of the government. A Cabinet member or the head of an
agency would have the sole choice between supporting the program
adopted by the government or resigning.
The sound view that for an official on the Cabinet level the only
alternatives as a matter both of effective public policy and of personal
self-respect, is to co6perate or to resign has never been established in
this country. There is instead a dangerous practice of remaining in office
against one's convictions in order not to split the party, and an inclina-
tion to refuse to quit under fire. These may be good rules of conduct,
when party loyalty or personal integrity is in question, but not when the
issue is one of national policy.
The ideal attitude of a Cabinet minister toward the Cabinet is de-
scribed by Viscount Grey in these significant words:
"... . to put his mind into the common stock; to work sincerely in
matters of difference of opinion and difficulty for a Cabinet decision.
This does not mean that what is regarded by a minister as vital to the
public interest should be compromised. A minister should resign rather
than agree to that [italics supplied]. It means that a minister should not
press his personal views unduly about what is not essential, that he
should contend for substance not for form, that he should consider with-
out amour-propre how his own opinion can be reconciled with that of
others. Subject to the one qualification of not sacrificing what he re-
gards as vital to the public interest, he should not contend for victory,
but for agreement in the Cabinet.
"The other qualification is that of accepting full personal responsibil-
ity for Cabinet decisions, when once agreed to."
This is a statement about a responsible Cabinet of the British type-
by a distinguished member. Adoption of similar principles in an Ameri-
can setting appears to be the only alternative to governmental fumbling.
A clear-cut administrative policy, with all the heads of government


---Economics-1947-0-12.txt---
departments committed to its support, would carry great weight with
the public, which placed it in power. It would also impress Congress.
Adoption in some form of the proposal for Cabinet members to appear
before Congress in person and answering questions in open meeting
would contribute further to cooperation between branches of the gov-
ernment and to recognition of complete accord on policy by the adminis-
tration. It may be feasible for candidates for the Presidency to name
their cabinets before election, so as to make the ministers more conscious
of their responsibility to the people, the ultimate source of their au-
thority.
An American form of responsible government could develop out of the
beginning made by theFull EmploymentAct if it is supported bythe adop-
tion of practices that would increase its effectiveness. The organization
and principles laid down by the constitution and sanctioned by Ameri-
ican tradition would be preserved, and at the same time the government
would become more purposeful and more responsive to the demands of
changing conditions.
To economists and to this Association, the recent step toward a bet-
ter formulated and better implemented public policy is not merely a
matter of general interest. It is a Council of Economic Advisers that
has been established and it is the Council's Economic Reports that are
expected to constitute the heart of public policy. This new instrument
of government gives the profession of economists a broad opportunity
of rendering greater service to the nation and places on them and on this
Association a correspondingly grave responsibility.
What(Congress has said to the economist is in the language of the
gaming table: "Put up-or shut up!" That's the economist's dilemma.
Since economists by occupational selection and by training are not able
to shut up-the only alternative is to put up, that is, to produce the
men, the data, and the understanding, and to promote the public sup-
port essential to the execution of effective economic policy. To this pur-
pose the efforts of economists and of their Association must be rededi-
cated on this its Diamond Jubilee. The Ivory Tower has been con-
quered by events and razed to the ground. The economist is out in the
open and must come to grips with problems of state.

I. Introduction
A century and a third ago, in 1815, Malthus' and Sir Edward West2
simultaneously pointed out that if successive combined doses of labor
and capital were applied to a given piece of land, the amount of the
product would increase by diminishing increments. Two years later
this principle was adopted by Ricardo in his Principles of Political
Economy as the basis for his theory of distribution. The joint return to
labor and capital was declared by Ricardo to be governed by and to
be equal to the amount of product added by the last combined dose
of labor and capital, while the owners of land received as rent all
sums in excess of these amounts. Since the quantities of labor and
capital were not supposed to vary in relation to each other but were
instead bound together in fixed and unvarying proportions, there was
no way of isolating the specific contributions of these two factors as a
means of determining the rates of wages and of interest. These rates
were instead presumed to be regulated by cost-of-supply factors,
namely, the Malthusian forces governing population which would keep
wages down to a fixed minimum which was at least close to basic sub-
sistence and the low minimum needed to compensate savers and in-
vestors. Such was the classical theory of distribution which dominated
economic thinking for over sixty years.
Meanwhile, in Germany, during the 1840's, Von Thiinen had the-
oretically broken up the combined dose of labor and capital and had
pointed out that when each of the factors was separately increased
but the others held constant, the product increased by diminishing


---Economics-1948-0-04.txt---
increments.3 Von Thilnen went on to state that the rates of wages and
of interest were equal to the amounts of the product added by the last
increments of each. He was thus the real discoverer of marginal pro-
ductivity. Nor was this all. He reasoned that the product added by each
equal increment of a factor was a constant fraction of the preceding
increment of product, namely two-thirds, in the case of labor and nine-
tenths, in the case of capital. This meant that it would be necessary to
increase a factor in a given geometric ratio in order to increase the
product by equal arithmetic amounts. This is precisely the law of the
soil which Mitscherlich and W. J. Spillman later discovered,4 and it
is strikingly similar to the so-called Weber-Fechner law of physiological
response. It would be most interesting to find out whether these con-
clusions of Von Thunen were merely happy hypotheses or whether,
like so much of his work, they were based upon experimentation.
Von Thunen's work, unfortunately, never had the influence which it
deserved. The British, with their customary insularity of thought,
virtually ignored it. The Germans, dominated by the fact-grubbing
historical school, while lavishing attention upon Von Thiunen's theory
of location and his advocacy of </ap as a just wage, almost com-
pletely neglected his discovery of the curve of the diminishing incre-
ment as the guiding principle for both production and distribution.
Indeed, schooled as they were to believe in the relativity of economic
principles, they naturally averted their gaze from what gave every
evidence of being an economic law, which was independent of time
and place.
It is to the glory of American economics that it was,-one of our
own number, John Bates Clark, who at a meeting of our Association
in 1888, fifty-nine years ago tonight, announced what was in effect
the rediscovery of the marginal productivity principle. Clark, who
had studied in Germany, had possibly been unconsciously influenced
by Von Thunen, but certainly he was not consciously following him
when he stated:5
An increasing amount of labor applied to a fixed amount of pure capital goods
yields a smaller and smaller rate of return. . . . Let there be ten thousnd
dollars worth of productive instruments and ten men to use them. Let each
man be supposed to create by the operation a product worth three dollars

---Economics-1948-0-05.txt---
a day. Raise now the number of workmen to twenty and let the capital remain
the same and each man will create less than before. A day's product will be
3 -X dollars. Each successive unit of labor employed in connection with a fixed
amount of pure capital produces less than any of its predecessors. ... General
wages tend to be equal to the actual product created by the last laborer that
is added to the social working force.6
The earnings of capital are subject to identically the same law as those of
labor; they are fixed by the product of the last increment that is brought into
the field. . . . Let the labor supply remain fixed and let capital increase and
each increment of the latter, as it enters the productive field finds that it can
create less than any of its predecessors. The general law of diminishing returns
is two-sided.7
During the next decade Clark completed his theory in a series of
subtle articles, and in 1899 gave it final expression in his book The
Distribution of Wealth.
In the meantime, in 1894, the extraordinarily gifted Philip Wicksteed
showed in his pathbreaking little essay, The Coordination of the Laws
of Distribution, that if production were characterized by a homo-
geneous linear function of the first degree (that is, if when each and
all of the factors of production were doubled or tripled, product would
increase in the same proportion), then with each factor receiving its
marginal product, the total product would be absorbed in payments to
the factors without either surplus or deficit. This essay of Wicksteed's
fluttered the mathematical dovecotes. Edgeworth, who in his Mathe-
matical Psychics, had attempted to prove, by quotations from Owen
Meredith's Lucille, that men should receive larger incomes than women,
now dismissed with elegant irony the theory that production followed
a homogeneous linear function. Pareto's attempted refutation was
almost pure sophistry in which, by limiting the market, he sought to
prove that product would not increase in proportion to the factors.
It remained for Wicksell to give the most sensible treatment of this
subject when he pointed out that while the homogeneous production
function could not be expected to apply over the whole range of output
within a plant, nevertheless under perfect competition, each firm would
tend to carry its scale of output to the point where neither increasing
nor decreasing returns prevailed but where instead the rate of return
was constant.8 Since industries were merely aggregates of firms and
the economy as a whole was an aggregate of industries, it was pre-
sumed that the linear function tended, therefore, to be true of society

---Economics-1948-0-06.txt---
as a whole at its growing points. Under these conditions, Wicksteed's
conclusion held that the payment of the marginal products to each
unit of the respective factors of production exactly distributed the
product.
At this point, the theoretical discussion of marginal productivity
was largely allowed to lapse, except for the clarifications and refine-
ments which were introduced by our chairman, Professor Carver and
by F. M. Taylor.
Over the course of the decades which followed, two tendencies in
economic teaching became fairly evident. The first was a form of split
personality or scientific schizophrenia, which developed in our eco-
nomics departments. In the classes in economic theory, the principles
of pure marginal productivity were taught, uncontaminated by any
idea that there might be imperfect competition in either the product
or the factor markets, or that there might be unemployment for reasons
other than a wage rate in excess of social marginal productivity. This
group taught that labor received the amount which its last unit added
to the total product multiplied by the number of workers, while the
return to capital was similarly determined. Neither trade union nor
governmental action was needed to give to labor its own marginal
product under conditions of full employment. All that was required
was for the employers to bid competitively against each other for
labor and this condition was commonly assumed to exist. But if gov-
ernment and unions disturbed the system of laissez-faire by raising
wage rates above the social margin, this could only be effected by de-
creasing the numbers employed and hence creating unemployment.
In the classes which dealt with labor economics, however, a different
doctrine was taught. Here marginal productivity was muted and the
theory of the Webbs, as developed in Industrial Democracy, was
stressed. It was the pressure of the market competition for lower prices
which, weighing more heavily upon the successive levels of sellers be-
cause of their heavier overhead costs, tended to drive down wages and
to worsen working conditions. Unions and governmental legislation
operating through the imposition of common rules, could not only
protect the workers from this competition but could raise the general
standard of living.
It would be a fascinating task to analyze the differences between
these two sets of theories; one dealing primarily with real and the
other, with money wages; one assuming the relative absence and the
other, the presence of unemployment; one postulating free and per-
fect competition between employers and between workers; the other
absorbed by the power struggles of combinations of employers and
workers. But such is not our present task. It is enough to point out


---Economics-1948-0-07.txt---
that both of these two widely conflicting doctrines have been taught
within our economics departments with little effort made by either
set of protagonists to determine the relative truth of either, or their
compatability. So far has this confusion of doctrine gone, that I have
known professors, who teaching both theory and labor economics,
have instilled the pure doctrine of John Bates Clark during one hour,
and then during the next hour have taught as economic gospel the
bargain theories of Sidney and Beatrice Webb!
The effect upon our students of this dualism in the winds of doctrine
has been most unfortunate. It has caused some to shrug their shoulders
and to dismiss all economic teaching with the words of Omar, so be-
loved by sophomores,
Myself when young, did eagerly frequent
Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument
About it and about; but evermore
Came out by the same door where in I went.
Others, like chameleons, have given diametrically different answers
to identical questions, depending on which instructor asked them.
But to every candidate for the Ph.D. degree, there has loomed the
nightmare of that dreaded hour when in his oral examination, he must
face both sets of teachers and know that the answers which would be
judged right by one school would be judged wrong by the other. Such
a state of affairs is at once both ridiculous and scandalous, and as
long as it continues, there is little hope for scientific progress or even
sound mental health among economists.
But within the ranks of the theorists themselves, a serious intel-
lectual slovenliness, unfortunately, set in. Convinced that the marginal
productivity curves of the factors were negatively inclined, they con-
tented themselves with drawing the curves as sloping downwards and
to the right, but took apparently little interest in trying to determine
what the positions and slopes of these curves actually were. Thus I
have seen an experienced instructor on successive days draw widely
differing marginal productivity curves for labor, one declining very
gradually, one at an angle of 450, and the third plunging sharply
downward. Moreover, this instructor gave every evidence of not
realizing that there was any significant difference between these curves
nor did he indicate whether he was drawing the curves upon an
arithmetic or a double logarithmic scale. Indeed, the slope of the
curve seemed to be determined partly by chance, partly by the stance
of the instructor, and partly by the degree to which he happened to
bend his arm!
The orthodox theorists may urge in self defense that they do not


---Economics-1948-0-08.txt---
have the statistical information which would permit them to approxi-
mate the production function, the elasticities of the marginal pro-
ductivity curves, or to determine the degree to which the actual
distribution of the product conforms to what one would expect from
the nature of the production function itself. But the sad truth of
the matter is that they have made little effort to find out and have
instead turned their backs upon inductive research and have, in effect,
been school men living within ivy-clad towers.
II. The Early Studies of the Cobb-Douglas Production Function
It was twenty years ago last spring that, having computed indexes
for American manufacturing of the numbers of workers employed by
years from 1899 to 1922, as well as indexes of the amounts of fixed
capital in manufacturing deflated to dollars of approximately constant
purchasing power, and then plotting these on a log scale together with
the Day index of physical production for manufacturing, I observed
that the product curve lay consistently between the two curves for the
factors of production and tended to be approximately a quarter of the
relative distance between the curve of the index for labor, which
showed the least increase over the period, and that of the index for
capital which showed the most. Since I was lecturing at Amherst
College at the time, I suggested to my friend, Charles W. Cobb, that
we seek to develop a formula which would measure the relative effect
of labor and capital upon product during this period. We were both
familiar with the Wicksteed analysis and Cobb was, of course, well
versed in the history of the Euler theorem. At his suggestion, therefore,
the sum of the exponents was tentatively made equal to unity in the
formula
P - bLkClk (1)
Here it was only necessary to find the values of b and k. This was
done by the method of least squares and the value of k was found to
be .75. This was almost precisely what we had expected because of
the relative distance of the product curve from those of the two factors.
The value of the capital exponent, or 1-k, was, of course, then taken
as .25. Using these values, we then computed indexes of what we
would theoretically have expected the product to be in each of the
years had it conformed precisely to the formula. We found that the
divergencies between the actual and theoretical product were not
great since in only one year did they amount to more than 11 per cent,
and that except for two years, the deviation of the differences was pre-
cisely what we would expect from the imperfect nature of the indexes
of capital and labor. Since our index of capital measured the quantities


---Economics-1948-0-09.txt---
which were available for, rather than their relative degree of use, it
did not make allowance for the idle capital in periods of depression nor
for the more intensive use of capital during years of prosperity.
Similarly, our index of labor did not make allowance for failures to
work full time in the bad years, nor for overtime hours which were
worked in the good years. It was, therefore, to be expected that the
actual product (P) would exceed the theoretical product (P') in years
of prosperity and would fall below it in years of depression. So in fact
it did in every year except the war years of 1918 and 1919. Professor
Cobb and I, therefore, regarded these deviations as additional evidence
of the general validity of the formula for normal times.
Still another striking bit of evidence was found in the fact that under
perfect competition with a production formula of this type we would
expect a factor to receive as its share of the product, the proportion
indicated by its exponent. From the income studies of the National
Bureau of Economic Research, we found that labor's share of the net
value product of manufacturing during the decade 1909-1918, was
estimated at 74.1 per cent, or almost precisely the value of the ex-
ponent for labor.
Professor Cobb and I embodied the results of our inquiries in a
paper which we read before this Association exactly twenty years ago
tonight.9 We then determined to analyze more of such time series.
Cobb computed indexes of labor, capital, and product in Massachu-
setts manufacturing for the period 1890-1926, and found the value of
k to be .743. Interestingly enough, it was also found that the average
of labor's share of the net value of the product in that state for that
period was .74, or a virtual identity with the value of k.'0 A similar
study, which was made in Chicago by Mr. Director for New South
Wales manufacturing for the period 1901-1927, found k to have a value
of .65.
There the matter more or less rested when my book, The Theory of
Wages, appeared in 1934. Three years later, with the aid of Mrs. Mar-
jorie Handsaker, I resumed our analysis of time series, and after
working up data for Victorian manufacturing for the period 1907-1929,
we found the value of k under the k and 1-k formula to be .7 1." Labor's
share of the net product or W/P was found to be .61 for this period.
We then introduced two important new features into our investiga-

---Economics-1948-0-10.txt---
tions. An able young American scholar, David Durand,'2 had published
in 1937, an excellent critical article of the earlier material, and had
urged that the restricted function of
P = bLkCl-k (1)
be abandoned for one in which the exponent for capital was independ-
ently determined. As he correctly pointed out, the use of the k and 1-k
function assumed the existence of an economic law which it should
be one of the tasks of science to test, namely, the assumption of true
constant returns. If we permitted the exponent for capital to be inde-
pendently determined, it would then be possible for the sum of the
exponents to be either greater or less than unity and hence to show
true increasing and decreasing as well as constant returns to scale. We
therefore decided that Durand's suggestion should be adopted and that
we should try to find the values in terms of the formula:
P - bLkC] (2)
The second change was to broaden our fields of investigation.
Hitherto, we had dealt only with time studies and had found the
values of our exponents from index numbers of labor, capital, and
product within a given economy, with each year serving as a separate
observation. Here we measured the effect upon total physical product,
of changes in the physical quantities of labor and of capital and from
these we derived curves of diminishing incremental physical produc-
tivity of the classical type. We now determined to open up another
field for investigation and to make cross-section analyses between in-
dustries in a given economy for specific years. Thus the annual statis-
tics of manufacturing for the British Dominions (although not the
British Census of Production itself) and the decennial and quin-
quennial Censuses for Manufacturing for the United States up until
1921 showed aggregates for each of a wide variety of industries from
which it was possible to compute: (1) aggregates of the average
numbers employed, including wage earners, clerical and salaried
employees, officials and generally firm members and working pro-
prietors (L), (2) aggregates of capital (C) expressed in terms of
dollars including both fixed and working capital, and (3) aggregates
of the net value of product added by manufacturing expressed in terms
of dollars (P).
In these studies, differences between industries in the quantities of
their net value product were presumed to be a function of the total

---Economics-1948-0-11.txt---
number of employees and of the total quantities of fixed and working
capital with each industry serving as a separate observation. This is
obviously a somewhat different production function from that which is
based on the time series. The quantities of labor used are physical
quantities and though capital is expressed in value terms, these are
also rough measurements of relative physical amounts. But since
product is also expressed in value terms, this is the result not only of:
(a) changes in the increments to the total physical product but also
of (b) changes in the exchange value, or the relative price per unit of
the products of an industry. The net values turned out by the respec-
tive industries will, therefore, be affected in these cases not only by
the quantities produced but also by the respective demand curves for
the products. Changes in each of these variables will affect the total
exchange value produced.
Some critics will, of course, object that this second type of study,
since it includes both quantities and prices, does not measure produc-
tion at all and is in no sense a test of marginal productivity theory. It
is certainly a somewhat different type of production function from
that which is based on index numbers of quantities. But marginal
productivity theory has always implicitly dealt in terms of values as
well as of physical quantities since it assumes that the supplies of labor
and capital in each of the various industries are regulated by the prin-
ciple that the respective marginal laborers will produce equal amounts
of value as will the marginal units of capital. In the apportionment
of resources within an economy, therefore, the principle of diminishing
incremental value productivity is an essential part of economic theory
and is worthy of consideration. There is no reason why a production
function which deals with it should not also be worthy of consideration
and treatment.
Although interrupted by the war, we now have completed six cross-
section or inter-industry studies for American manufacturing, namely,
for the years 1889, 1899, 1904, 1909, 1914, and 1919; four cross-
section studies for Canada covering the years 1923, 1927, 1935, and
1937; three studies for Victoria for the years 1910-11, 1923-24, and
1927-28; one study for New South Wales for 1933-34, and five studies
for the Commonwealth of Australia, namely, 1912, 1922-23, 1926-27,
1934-35, and 1936-37. Two of my students, Messrs. G. Brinegar and
K. 0. Campbell, have just finished such a study for Queensland for
1937-38, and two more, Messrs. B. Solomon and N. A. Deif, are
completing another study for New Zealand for 1926-27. In all, there-
fore, twenty-one cross-section studies have been carried through by
our Chicago group to add to our previous four time studies, namely,


---Economics-1948-0-12.txt---
for the United States, Massachusetts, New South Wales, and Victoria.
In addition, two New Zealand economists, Max Brown"3 and J. W.
Williams,'4 have carried through two time studies for New Zealand
while the latter has also carried through a cross-section study for that
country, as has G. W. G. Browne"5 for South Africa. We have, there-
fore, records for a total of twenty-nine inductive studies of the produc-
tion function instead of the three which were reported upon thirteen
years ago in The Theory of Wages.
In these investigations which have been carried out over the last
two decades, we have had the assistance of a devoted and, I believe,
competent group of associates, and in the aggregate many tens of thou-
sands of hours have been spent upon the work. I am deeply indebted
to this group, and while I am solely responsible for any errors which
may lie within the work, my associates are chiefly entitled to any credit
which may be forthcoming.'6
Since these studies were carried out over a period of many years
and since there were differences between countries and between years
within a country in the basic data used, and since we were also con-
stantly trying to improve our methods, it was inevitable that some
dissimilarities should have developed in the precise content of the
categories used and in the methods of attack. We have now ironed
out a great many of these differences, and I believe that with a few
exceptions which will be later noted, the results have now been made
roughly comparable. It is hoped that in the next few months they may
be made completely so.
III. The Main Results of the Study of the Production
Function in Manufacturing
We can summarize the main results of these studies in three tables.
Table I brings together the main results for manufacturing in the


---Economics-1948-0-13.txt---
United States, as does Table II, for Australia; while Table III covers
the investigations for the three British Dominions of New Zealand,
South Africa, and Canada.
We may properly begin with a consideration of the American results,
which include four time series studies for the period 1899-1922, and
six cross-section or inter-industry investigations for the various census
years from 1889 to 1919. It is unfortunate that the statistics of capital
were omitted from the United State Census of Manufactures after
1919 and that we have been unable to continue our analysis of Ameri-
can data beyond the dates stated. Fortunately, the British Dominions
in their admirable annual Censuses of Production have continued to
collect statistics on the amounts of capital invested and this has per-
mitted us to carry on studies for these countries in more recent times.
The four sets of time studies for the United States show somewhat
differing results because of the differences which exist between the
series of index numbers for labor and product. The precise nature of
these series is described in the footnotes to Table I. It is believed
that Series II, III, and IV, are appreciable improvements over the
original Cobb-Douglas series or Series I. It will be observed that Series
II and III, which use total man years (including clerical employees
as well as wage earners) and total standard man hours respectively,
as the measure of labor, show k's with values of .78 and .73 respectively.
Series IV, which eliminates secular trends from each of the three basic
series and expresses each observation as a percentage of its respective
trend, gives k a value of .63. The value of j varies from .15 under
Series II to .30 under Series IV. On the whole, Series II is the one in
which the definition of the factors of production is most comparable
to that of the cross-section or inter-industry studies, but Series IV
avoids the dangers connected with the downward bias of the index of
production and also eliminates the factor of time.
Five of the six inter-industries studies show lower values for k than
do Series I, II, and III of the time studies. The k's average .63 for the
six cross-section years with the average of the j's amounting to .34. The
values of k and j for the initial and terminal years of 1889 and 1919,
however, deviate appreciably from this average. Those for the earlier
years have lower values of k and higher values of j, while in 1919 this
tendency is reversed. The values of the exponents during the four
middle years of 1899, 1904, 1909, and 1914, however, do exhibit a
marked stability around the general average, with the k's ranging
between .61 and .65, and the j's between .31 and .37.
It will be observed that in three cross-section studies, the values of
k and j are many times their respective standard errors, the k's from


---Economics-1948-0-14.txt---

---Economics-1948-0-15.txt---
17 to 38 times their standard errors and the j's from 12 to 18 times as
great as their standard errors.
On the whole, we should not be surprised by the fact that we obtain
higher values for k and lower values for j in our first three time series
studies than we do for the cross-section studies. For as we have pointed
out, the two functions are, in fact, somewhat different and we should
not necessarily expect identical results. Moreover, in the time studies,
there tends to be a systematic downward bias to the index of produc-
tion which keeps it closer to the index of labor than it should be in
reality and hence gives an excessive value to k. This downward bias is
caused by two factors: (1) Since the indexes are primarily based on
the quantities of raw material produced, they do not include the in-
creased fabrication and reworking of these materials which is a pro-
nounced, although not a universal, tendency of industry. (2) It is in
practice not possible to include with sufficient rapidity the new
products which are continually pushing themselves forward, nor to drop
in adequate time the products which are becoming obsolete. The net
result is to keep the index numbers of Product (P), particularly during
the latter years of a given period, closer to Labor (L) than in reality
they should be and hence k is raised above and j is depressed below
their "true" values.
This weakness is absent from the cross-section or inter-industry
studies, which are made for a given year, and we would, therefore,
expect the k's to be lower and the j's to be higher in this group of
studies. Such is, in fact, exactly the case.
It may be of some significance that when the factor of time is
eliminated from each of the three basic series of Labor, Capital, and
Product, and the deviations from the trends are studied (as in Series
IV), that the true value of k for the period of 1899-1922 is reduced to
.63. This is identical with the average value of k for the six years for
which inter-industry studies were made.
It may also be of some significance that in three of the four time

---Economics-1948-0-16.txt---
studies and in five of the six cross-section studies, the sum of k and j
is slightly less than unity. While this by no means establishes the
reality of true diminishing returns, since the differences between k + j
and unity are well within the range of the standard errors, there is at
least a faint suggestion to that effect. It is possible that American
manufacturing industry during this period may have exceeded the
optimum size and that the desire for the power and prestige which is
attached to bigness may have caused firms to be conducted on a larger
scale than that which was justified by the most efficient combination
of the factors of production.
While all due caution in drawing conclusions should be observed, it
would seem that the most likely long-run norm for k during the period
covered was between .63 and .64; and for j was approximately .34.
This would mean that a change of one per cent in the quantity of labor
(unaccompanied by any change in the quantity of capital) would
normally result during this period in a change in the same direction of
about sixty-three or sixty-four hundredths of one per cent in the
quantity of product, and that similarly a change of one per cent in
quantity of capital (unaccompanied by any change in the quantity of
labor) would normally result, during this period, in a change in the
same direction of about thirty-four hundredths of one per cent. If both
factors of production were increased by one per cent, then the total
product would normally increase during this period by from ninety-
seven to ninety-eight hundredths of one per cent.
If we disregard the slight suggestion of decreasing returns and treat
the most probable sum of the exponents as equal to unity, then an in-
crease of one per cent in the quantities of both labor and capital would
normally result in a corresponding increase of one per cent in product.
A one per cent increase in the quantity of labor alone would normally
be accompanied, during this period, by an increase of approximately
two-thirds of one per cent in product and an increase of one per cent
in the quantity of capital alone would normally be accompanied by
an approximate increase of one-third of one per cent in the product.
Perhaps this is as close a tentative conclusion as we should draw for
this period although further studies may lead to some revision of these
results.
Since under these conditions (i.e., k + j 1.0) the clasticity of the
marginal productivity curves for a given factor is equal to the reciprocal
1 1
of the exponent for the other factors, that is eL, = and ec - 1 ,
1-k i -j
it f ollows that the approximate elasticity of the normal marginal pro-


---Economics-1948-0-17.txt---
ductivity curve for labor during this period would seem to be not far
from 3.0, and for capital, to be around 1.5'"
Let us now turn to the examination of the two time series and nine
cross-section studies which have been made for Australia, and which
are summarized in Table II, with its accompanying notes. In the Vic-
torian time study, k has a value of .84 and j of .23, while in the New
South Wales study, the value of k is .78, and that of j is .20. It should
be noticed, however, that the respective standard errors of k and j
are quite high and that the values of k under the original formula
(P bLkClk) vary somewhat from those obtained under the second
formula.
As we would expect from the reasons which have been given, the
values of k in the nine cross-section studies for Australia are some-
what lower. The combined average of the k's was .60 and of the j's
was .37. Their average sum was, therefore, .97. Here it will be observed
that we get identical results with either formula since the average of the
k's under formula (1) is also .60. It should also be noted that the
values of k are from 8 to 14 times and the j's from 3 to 10 times their
standard errors.
The results for the five Commonwealth studies differ somewhat from
those for the separate states, having somewhat lower k's and higher j's.
Thus, in the Commonwealth, the average of the k's is .55, with a spread
in individual years between .49 and .64, while the average for the four
state studies is .65. On the other hand, the j's average .43 in the Com-
monwealth, as contrasted with .20 in the state studies.'8 After the text

for this article had been prepared, Keith Campbell and George
Brinegar, in their Queensland study for 1937-38, found k to have a
value of .58 and j one of .45.19
Since the sum of the exponents tends to be sliglhtly less than unity,
there is an added slight suggestion of true diminishing returns. But
here again, since the difference is less than the standard errors of
estimate, we should be chary about drawing definite conclusions.
If we choose .60 as the most probable "normal" value of k and .37
as the corresponding value of j, this would mean that the approximate
elasticity of the marginal productivity curve in Australia for labor
was somewhere around 2.7 and for capital of about 1.7.
The third set of results which we should consider are those for New
Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. These are shown in Table III.
Using the formula of k and 1-k, Max Brown found for New Zealand a
value of .51 for k for the period 1915-1935,2o and when we reworked
the Brown series with the second formula, we found values of .42 for
k and .49 for j. It is interesting that in the single cross-section study
which has been made for New Zealand, namely, that made by Williams
for 1938-39, k has a value of .46 and j of .51.2Oa In the four Canadian
studies which we made for so-called "normal" years, the k's range
between .43 and .50, with an average of .47, and the j's between .48
and .58, with an average of slightly more than .52. There is a con-
siderable degree of steadiness in these results, which seem to indicate
an elasticity of the marginal productivity curve for labor in that country
as slightly less than 2.0 for the years studied and of capital as slightly
more than that figure.
One of the most interesting studies which has been made is that by
G. W. G. Browne for South Africa for 1937-38. Taking the seventeen
main groups of industry and treating all labor as homogeneous, Browne



---Economics-1948-0-20.txt---


---Economics-1948-0-21.txt---
found the value of k was .66, and that for j, .32. When he made white
and black labor separate factors of production and broke manufactur-
ing down into eighty-five industries, the sum of the two exponents for
labor amounted to .65. While we cannot rely too much upon only one
study, it is of interest that his results were substantially the same as
those which we obtained on the average for the United States for the
period 1889-1919 and not far from the Australian results. This would
be equivalent to an elasticity of approximately 3.0 for the marginal
productivity curve for labor and of 1.5 for the marginal productivity
curve for capital.
If we try to summarize our results, we do find a relatively close
agreement between the values of k and j which we obtain from the
cross-section studies for the United States, Australia, and South Africa.
But we also find differences in the values of k and j (1) between
Canada and New Zealand, on the one hand, and the United States,
upon the other, with the former having lower k's and higher j's than
the United States, and (2) between years within the same country.
This is to be expected, as I pointed out long ago in a section of my
Theory of Wages."1 But underneath all these differences, it is submitted
that there has been for the periods studied, a substantial core of stabil-
ity within countries and that differences in technique, differences in the
relative importance of given industries, and differences in the ratios
of capital to labor may account for such deviations in the values of the
exponents as exist.22

It is submitted that the results are, on the whole, corroborative. If
they were purely accidental, as some have charged, they would show
widely varying results. The fact that on the basis of fairly wide studies
there is an appreciable degree of uniformity, and that the sum of the

moved up or down by the small difference between the values of b and unity. In the time
series, of course, we are dealing with index numbers which show relative changes, not
absolute values.

of the greater degree of freedom given to the exponent for capital. Here the values for

exponents approximates unity, fairly clearly suggests that there are
laws of production which can be approximated by inductive studies
and that we are at least approaching them.
And yet it is proper to chronicle the fact that we have obtained
some negative results. One persistent area of difficulty in these last
months has been the Massachusetts time series. We tried to improve
on Professor Cobb's series of capital and product with the result that
the more we refined the basic series, the more nonsensical the results
became. We are still working on this problem, but at the moment we
certainly do not see the light. Secondly, it is disconcerting to observe
that if we shorten our time periods by dropping off a number of terminal
years, we appreciably alter our results. We observed this fact earlier,
as did Professor Williams in New Zealand, but this paradox has been
most manifest when we omit the war years from 1916 on, in our
United States time series. Finally, we have attempted various inter-
spatial studies in which we use individual states as separate observa-
tions. We have personally had no success with these attempts. The
most ambitious study of this latter nature has, however, been made by
my friend and former associate, Ernest Olson, and will be presented to
this Association later in these meetings. I do not wish to anticipate the
results of his paper, but I think it is proper to say that Mr. Olson has
been able to develop a formula which makes differences between coun-
tries in their real national income a mathematical function of (1) the
total energy used, (2) the numbers of the working population, (3) the
quantity of livestock reduced to comparable units, and (4) the amount
of land-and he has derived exponents which indicate the comparative
importance of each. There is still much to be done in this direction and
some hard puzzles remain to be solved, but Mr. Olson's comparative
success offers us some hope that we may not face a completely blank
wall in working with this third method for deriving the laws of pro-
duction.
Finally, I should like to point out that in the case of the United
States, we were compelled because of lack of capital figures, to stop with
1922 in our time series and with 1919 in our cross-section studies. We
have, therefore, not been able to cover the very perplexing period of
1920-40. I am doubtful for two reasons whether we can develop a
satisfactory production function for the United States during this
period: (a) In spite of the excellent work of the National Bureau of
Economic Research, we still lack adequate data for this period on the
capital available for use; and (b) there was wide variation between the
decades in the degree to which the available capital was actually used.
During the 'twenties, capital was quite fully employed, but during the


---Economics-1948-0-24.txt---
'thirties a large proportion of this equipment lay idle. Variations in the
degree to which available capital was utilized created some difficulties
within the ordinary business cycles which prevailed between 1899 and
1919 when each of the four phases of the cycle did not last for more
than one or two years. But the period between the two wars was quite
extraordinary in that we had high prosperity from 1922 to the fall of
1929 and that we did not fully recover from the collapse which then
set in until 1941. It was this fundamental difficulty which prevented one
of my students, Mr. Leonard Felsenthal, from developing a satisfactory
production function for Germany in the inter-war period. I shall, there-
fore, await with sympathetic interest the paper on this subject which
Mr. Burton Wall is to give tomorrow.
IV. The Production Function as Based on Plant Averages Rather
than Industry Aggregates
The inductive values which have thus far been developed in the
cross-section or inter-industry studies have been based on industry
aggregates, namely the totals of workers, capital, and net values added
by manufacturing in each industry. This method is somewhat discon-
certing to those who are accustomed in their a priori reasoning to start
with the theory of production for the individual firm and who then
move to a model for a given industry but who shy away from develop-
ing a theory of production for the economy as a whole or from the
manufacturing sector of that economy. Such theorists probably be-
lieve that we are starting at the wrong end and that we should begin
instead with the individual firm rather than the whole manufacturing
sector of the economy and that we should consider the production func-
tion within these units rather than deal with inter-industry and aggre-
gate functions.
There are two answers to this position. The first is that I should be
very glad indeed to make studies of individual firms if the necessary
data were available. But statistics on the changing quantities of labor
and capital which are used over a period of time by individual firms,
and the amounts of product which are thus turned out by them, are
some of the most carefully guarded secrets of business. I am reluctant
to believe that we should stop all our investigations until all of these
facts are forthcoming for a multitude of firms.
Secondly, I personally see no reason why we cannot approach this
problem from either end and study the macrocosm as well as the
microcosm. No one, for example, in the physical sciences would pro-
pose that we give up using the telescope because the microscope had
not yielded all its secrets. Why should we not, therefore, study the


---Economics-1948-0-25.txt---
economy as a whole as well as speculate about the individual firm,
particularly since a knowledge of the former throws a great deal of
light upon the problems of the latter?
In the meantime, however, we should all welcome such brilliant
studies of the production function for individual firms as that which
will shortly be published by my friend and colleague, Professor William
H. Nicholls, for a meat-packing plant.22a Moreover, if we could get the
figures for specific firms and plants within given industries for a specific
year, we would then be able to develop production functions for each
of the main industries with each firm serving as an observation. But
the census has always been obligated to conceal the identity of the
specific firms which report to it and can only publish totals by in-
dustries and geographical subdivisions. This fact prevents us, at
present, from developing such studies, although it is barely possible
that either the Census Bureau itself or employers' associations could
carry them on, were they once convinced of their value. This cannot,
however, be done at present.
To my mind, therefore, we are at present forced to work primarily
with industry aggregates. But there is one important refinement which
we can and should introduce. That is to divide the total number of
workers, the aggregate amounts of capital, and the total net value of the
product in each of the various industries by the number of plants in
that industry. This will give us plant averages for given industries
rather than industry aggregates as the individual observations23 and
from these we can derive another variant of the production function.
We have made such studies for each of the six years which were
covered for American manufacturing and for two of the Australian
studies and these results are embodied in Table IV.
It will thus be seen that while we obtained closely similar results in
Australia by the two methods, nevertheless, clear differences developed
in the case of the United States. In every year the value of k in our
American studies was substantially less under the method of plant
averages than it was under the method of industry aggregates. The
amount of this difference ranged between 5 and 6 points, as in 1904 and
1909, to 15 points in 1889. On the other hand, the values of j were
always higher under the methods of plant averages than under that of
industry aggregates but the amounts of these differences were much less.
As a result, the combined values of k + j are less by from 3 to 8 points

---Economics-1948-0-26.txt---
on the plant average basis than they are when industry aggregates are
used and, indeed, average only .92. This gives an unmistakable in-
dication of true diminishing returns so far as the size of individual
plants is concerned. While much more study is needed to develop and
to clarify this point, it is suggested that quite possibly American plants
during this period were in practice developed beyond the point of
maximum efficiency. Whether or not the differences between the re-
spective k + j's can be taken as a coefficient of managerial megalo-
mania, I shall have to leave to the psychiatrists.24

V. Do the Deviations of the Actual Products from Those Which We
Would Theoretically Expect from the Formula Tend to Strengthen
or Weaken Belief in the Validity of the
Production Function?
An important test of our function is the degree to which the values
of the product which we would expect from the quantities of labor
and capital available, tend in practice to be realized in terms of actual
product in each of the various industries during the given years. We
have made these tests and I should like to present our results in a
series of charts and summary tables. As a first step, we computed


---Economics-1948-0-28.txt---
the standard errors of estimate (S) for each stuidy. Under a normal
distribution of cases with the only departures of the actual from
theoretical values being those caused by random errors of measure-
ment and of sampling, we would expect that in 68.3 per cent of the cases
the actual values would deviate from the theoretical values by less
than one standard error of estimate, and that in 95 per cent of the
cases the actual values would deviate from the theoretical values by
less than two such standard errors. In only one per cent of the cases
would the actual values deviate by more than three standard errors of
estimate. Then in our charts of the cross-section or inter-industry


---Economics-1948-0-29.txt---
studies, we have plotted the logs of the theoretical or expected products
on the vertical scale and of the actual products on the horizontal scale.
Since the values of scale are the same on both axes, the line BB' (with
a slope of unity) is the locus of all those points for which the theoretical
values of the product are identical with the actual values. In these
studies for a given year, it will be remembered that each industry
constitutes a separate observation.
The degree of departure of the actual from the theoretical values is,
therefore, shown by either the horizontal or the vertical distance of a
given point from the line BB'. We have, therefore, marked out on each


---Economics-1948-0-30.txt---
side of the line BB' two other pairs of lines at the respective distances
of one and two standard errors of estimate. An inspection of these
charts for American manufacturing for the years 1889, 1899, 1904,
1909, 1914, and 1919, (Charts I, II, III, IV, V, and VI) show that in
practice the actual values tend to be close to the line BB', and a sta-
tistical analysis of these variations is given in Table V. Here it will be
seen that in every year more than 70 per cent of the actual values were
within one standard error of estimate of the values which we would
theoretically expect under the formula and that in two of the six years,
over 80 per cent of the cases were within this range.
Taking the 2185 industry observations in the United States as a
whole, we find that in 76.5 per cent of the cases, the actual products
were within one standard error of estimate of the theoretical products,
whereas under a normal distribution we would only expect a little over
68 per cent of the cases to lie within this range. Moreover, in only one
year did the number of observations whose actual products varied
from the theoretical values by more than two standard errors of esti-
mate come to as much as 6 per cent of the total while the average for
all 2185 observations was 4 per cent as compared with the 5 per cent
which we would normally expect.25
In our American studies, the distribution of the actual values about

---Economics-1948-0-31.txt---
the theoretical values is, therefore, somewhat closer than what we
would normally expect on the basis of random errors of sampling and
of measurement. Belief in the reliability of the formula as a descrip-
tion of production during this period is, therefore, strengthened, rather
than weakened.

Let us see from Table VI if these results are confirmed by an analysis
of the deviations of the actual from the theoretical values in the thirteen
cross-section studies which we have thus far made for the Dominions
within the British Commonwealth of Nations. It will be noticed that
out of the total of 1373 observations, 1025, or over 74 per cent deviated
by less than one standard error of estimate from the theoretical values,


---Economics-1948-0-32.txt---
and that between 94 and 95 per cent deviated by less than two stand-
ard errors of estimate. The distribution of the observations in this
sample is, therefore, somnewhat better than that which we would expect
under normzal condi'tions of random error. Credence in the production
function would seem to be further reinforced."5a
The fact that we have, therefore, in practice, a somewhat closer
distribution of the actual values about the line of the theoretical values


---Economics-1948-0-33.txt---
under the formula than we would normally expect, is all the more
striking in view of the fact that the values of the production function
need not be the same within all industries or allied groups of industries.

As I have constantly pointed out during the last twenty years, there
is no reason why the exponents of capital and labor should be constant
for all periods and economies. As a matter of fact, we have already
seen that they are not and that there is some variation between coun-
tries and years in the values of k and j. We would similarly expect
some variation to exist as between groups of industries within a country
at any given time. Thus the values of the production function for the


---Economics-1948-0-34.txt---
textile industries need not be the same as for the clothing group, while
these might well differ from those prevailing in the food industries
and be appreciably different from those in the iron and steel and heavy
metals industries, etc. If, therefore, we could compute separate values

of k and j for each of the various main groups of manufacturing and
compare the actual with the resulting theoretical products, we could
doubtless find the resulting deviations to be appreciably less than those
obtained when we treat all manufacturing as a whole. The fact that we do
get such a good fit when we treat all of the industries as homogeneous
is, therefore, all the more remarkable. It seems, further, to suggest that
to the degree that the values of k and j do differ between groups of


---Economics-1948-0-35.txt---
industries, such differences tend to be more or less symmetrically dis-
tributed around the "normal" values which we have found in the given
years for manufacturing as a whole.
A further analysis of the plus and minus deviations offers interesting
suggestions. We would expect industries characterized by monopoly
and by highly imperfect competition to have a value product which
would be appreciably greater than that which we would expect from
the production formula itself, and from the quantities of labor and
capital which are available. This would be caused by the control over
supplies and prices exercised by the dominant firms and by their
ability to control or to limit entrance into the monopolized industries.
Conversely, in the industries which may be characterized by "exces-
sive" competition into which large numbers of workers and also in
some cases, relatively large quantities of capital are forced and which
consequently lower the marginal productivity of one or both factors
appreciably below their general levels, we would expect the value prod-
uct per unit of labor and possibly also of capital, to be below the gen-
eral average for society as a whole.
Similarly, we would expect that the industries which are rapidly
expanding because of an increase in demand or in the disposition of
consumers income, or because of great technical progress, will have
value products which are in excess of those derived from the formula.
Conversely, again, we would expect that the contracting industries,
which are suffering from a decrease in demand and an obsolescence of
technique, would produce less value product than that which our
formula would predict.
There are, moreover, a considerable number of industries which
probably can best be described as "sweated." These are industries
which have had large supplies of cheap labor, sometimes caused, as in
the past, by an influx of immigrants or by the presence of a large num-
ber of women and juveniles who are forced to seek work because of
the low earnings of the male heads of households. The average earnings
in these industries tends to be appreciably below the national average,
and if there is a normal degree of competition at work, these low earn-
ings will commonly be translated into a lower sales price for the product
than would normally be the case. The value product in these industries
will, therefore, tend to be less than what would be shown under the
formula for manufacturing as a whole.
We can test the relative truth of these hypotheses both by statistical
analysis and also by identifying the specific industries where the devia-
tions of the actual from the theoretical values are great. In analyzing
the American deviations by years, as in Table VII, certain marked


---Economics-1948-0-36.txt---
differences appear between the results for the earliest year of 1889
and the years from 1904 on. From 1904 on, and particularly in 1914
and 1919, the big deviations were predominantly on the plus, and the
minor deviations on the minus, side. Thus, in 1919, of the 18 industries
where the deviations amounted to more than two standard errors of
estimate, 16 had their actual products in excess of the theoretical
values, while in only two cases did they fall below. On the other hand,
of the 538 industries in 1919 where the deviations amounted to less
than two standard errors, 308 or nearly three-fifths, were below what
would have been expected under the formula. For the three census years
of 1909, 1914, and 1919, there were 29 industry observations where
the actual products were more than two standard errors of estimate
greater than the theoretical values and only 10 industry observations
which were more than two standard errors less. Conversely, in these
three years there were only 504 industries which had actual products
which exceeded the theoretical values up to two standard errors as
contrasted with 613 industries where the actual products fell below
the theoretical by these amounts.
The general framework of these later results is approximately what
we would expect on theoretical grounds. The monopolistic and expand-
ing industries tend to absorb large quantities of purchasing power at
the expense of the rest of the economy. They would, therefore, be
expected to show wider profit margins than the general average and
each combined dose of labor and capital would consequently tend to
yield a greater dollar value than would normally be the case. The with-
drawal of this purchasing power would, moreover, exert a slight de-
pressing influence upon each of the remaining industries so that we


---Economics-1948-0-37.txt---
would expect the number of industries where the actual product fell
below the theoretical to exceed in number those where it was greater.
This was exactly what happened from 1904 to 1919. Why the opposite
result should have occurred in 1889 and to a much lesser degree in
1899, however, merits further study.
Even more important, however, is an analysis of each of the 87
American cases where the deviations were more than two standard
errors of estimate from the theoretical values and I only regret that
lack of time prevents a full analysis of these instances. Let us first
consider the forty in which the deviations were of a minus nature. In no
less than ten cases, these were in the flax, hemp, linen, jute and oakum
family of industries, which has always been one of the most "sweated"
groups in all industrial countries. Two were in allied "sweated" in-
dustries, namely nets and seines (1904) and hammocks (1889), while
three more were connected with cotton which has generally been a
sub-standard industry. Three more, charcoal, waste, and canning
oysters, have been distinctly disagreeable and badly "sweated" indus-
tries, while several others, such as grindstones, millstones, hooks and
eyes, etc., were instances of contracting demand.
On the other hand, the vast majority of the plus deviations which
amounted to more than two standard errors of estimate can be ex-
plained as caused by (1) some form of quasi-monopoly or imperfect
competition, or (2) by expanding demand, or (3) by both factors.
Examples of the first are wood engraving, gold and silver reducing,
lapidary work, music publishing, glucose, starch, linseed oil, patent
medicines, tin plate, brass, and lead. These in themselves accounted
for nineteen of the markedly plus deviations.
Illustrations of the second group, namely those caused by an ex-
panding demand, were cordials and flavoring syrups (1909, 1914,
1919), oleomargarine (1914), perfumery (1919), and washing ma-
chines (1919).
There is also a third class of plus deviations which was probably
affected both by imperfect competition and by expanding demand. Il-
lustrations of this group are airplanes (1914), chewing gum (1919),
cigars and cigarettes (1919), fountain pens (1914), photographic sup-
plies and equipment (1904, 1909, 1914), cash registers (1889), smelt-
ing and refining copper (1899, 1904), typewriters and supplies (1889).
A very large majority of the major deviations so far as the United
States is concerned, were, therefore, precisely what we would expect
on a priori grounds. Belief in the function as a description of "normal"
relationships is, therefore, still further strengthened.

VI. To What Degree Do the Shares Which Labor and Capital Receive
of the Product Approximate the Proportions Which We Would
Expect from the Values of the Production Function?
We now come to one of the most important features of the theory of
production and of distribution, namely, the relative degree to which
the actual shares received by labor and capital approximate those

which we would expect from the values of the production function. As
my associates and I have demonstrated mathematically a number of
times, we would expect, under conditions of (1) true constant returns
where the sum of the exponents is equal to unity and (2) perfect
competition, that each factor of production would receive that fraction
of the total product which is indicated by its exponent.26


---Economics-1948-0-39.txt---
Let us, therefore, compare the actual share which wages and salaries
formed of the net value product (i.e., W/P) in the various years with
the values of k. It will also be instructive to compare W/P with the
k
ratio of since the latter is a rough measure of what we would
k + j
approximately expect to occur if the total product were to be divided
between labor and capital so as to eliminate either net residual profits
or losses.
This is shown for the United States cross-section studies in Table
VIII. From an examination of this table, it will be seen that in five
of the six years there was a very close agreement between the values
of k and of W/P. In one year (1909), there was precise agreement
between the two; in two of the years (1904 and 1914), the differences
were approximately only one standard error, while in two more (1889
and 1899), they amounted to two to three standard errors. The biggest
difference was in 1919 when W/P was less than k by over eight stand-
ard errors."
Taking the average for the six years as a whole, we find that k
k
averages .63, equals .65, and labor's actual share or bl/P was
k+ j
.605. There was, therefore, a close average agreement for the period
between what we would have theoretically expected the distribution of
the product to be under conditions of perfect competition and that
which actually occurred. It should be remembered, moreover, that due
to our inability to deduct allowances for depreciation in specific in-
dustries, the true values of W/P are probably understated by ap-
proximately 3 percentage points,28 and that, therefore, the average

---Economics-1948-0-40.txt---
ratio of W/P was probably very close to .63 or the exact average
value of k.
I submit, therefore, that the degree of agreement between the values
of k and of W/P is most striking and that the results conform to what
normally would be expected to occur under competitive productivity
theory. Hence, this constitutes a still further reinforcement to the
productivity function itself.
It should, however, be frankly recognized that there is a further
problem of reconciling these results with the known facts of imperfect
competition, oligopoly and monopoly. Such conditions, as has been
abundantly developed in our meetings, do exist, and, in fact, charac-
terize a large sector of our economy. It is, therefore, puzzling to find
labor's share approximately equal to that which we would expect under
conditions of perfect competition. A further investigation of this sub-
ject is much needed. In the meantime, I would merely suggest that
perhaps one answer to the paradox may be that the quasi-monopolies
and oligopolies may have shared with their workers the excess gains
which they have made at the expense of the consumers.
We can make a further test of the degree to which W/P approxi-
k
mates k and by examining the results for the British Dominions
of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. This is done in Table IX.
Taken in the large, the agreement in the cross-section studies for
Australia between the values of W/P and k are indeed striking. In each
and all of the five inter-industry studies for the Commonwealth, the
differences never exceeded one standard error of k. For the five years
as a whole, the average value of k and W/P were both .55. The average
k
value of was .56. It would scarcely be possible to have a closer
k? j
agreement than this.
In the case of the four studies for the Australian states, the dif-
ferences in the case of Victoria were not great, never exceeding two
standard errors of k and being slightly reduced if the comparisons are
k
made between W/P and .29 For the three years as a whole, the
k? j
differences are largely ironed out since the average values of k are .65
k
and of W/P .66. The average value of was .70.
k? j


---Economics-1948-0-41.txt---


---Economics-1948-0-42.txt---
In the one cross-section study which was carried through for New
South WVales, the differences were greater, amounting to between 3
and 4 standard errors of estimate. In the case of Canada, however, the
average degree of agreement was very close. The average value of k
k
for the four years was .47, and similarly, was .47; while the
k?j.
average ratio of W/P was .48. This is an almost precise agreement.
This agreement was also true of the years 1923 and 1927 when they
are considered individually. The years 1935 and 1937, however, exhibit
opposing tendencies. In the former year, k exceeded W/P by an ap-
preciable amount; in the latter year, which was marked by great wage
advances in the United States, which were reflected to some degree in
Canada, this situation was exactly reversed. The two differences, how-
ever, almost precisely offset each other. The case of South Africa does,
however, merit special mention. As I have pointed out, Professor
Browne found that the combined exponents for black and white labor
in 1937-38 were .65, but he also found that both groups of labor re-
ceived only a total of .46 per cent of the net value added. While Profes-
sor Browne does not draw such a conclusion, perhaps this is a case
where a highly monopolized set of industries which are largely run by
foreign employers or by men whose cultural interests are elsewhere, do
not give to the laborers that which in a competitive society they would
obtain.
VII. Summary
After working on this problem for the better part of twenty years,
I think I am aware of the many difficulties which are involved. In a
few cases, the method apparently breaks down and in other cases in-
congruous results are obtained. I should like to suggest, however, that
the following tentative conclusions seem justified.
1. That within a given country for the periods studied, there is a
substantial and indeed a surprising degree of agreement in the values
of k and of j which we obtain for various years.
2. There is also a surprising degree of agreement between the results
for the United States, Australia, and South Africa.
3. It is hard to believe that these results can be purely accidental,
as some critics have maintained.30 Time studies for the period between


---Economics-1948-0-43.txt---
the two great wars are, however, likely to present difficulties,.
4. The deviations of the actual or observed values from those which
we would theoretically expect to prevail under the formula are not large
and indeed are slightly less than we would expect under the random
distribution of errors of sampling and of measurement. It is submitted
that the total number of observations, namely over 3,500, is sufficiently
large so that if the results had been purely accidental, this degree of
agreement would not have occurred.
5. The instances of large deviations of the actual from the theoretical
values can in most cases be explained as being caused by imperfect
competition and by expanding demand in the case of the plus deviations
and by contracting demand, "sweating," and possibly "excessive" com-
petition in the case of the minus industries. This would indicate that if
these complications could be eliminated, the agreement between the
actual and theoretical products would be greater.
6. That, taken in the large, there is an almost precise degree of
agreement between the actual share received by labor and that which,
according to the theory of marginal productivity, we would expect labor
to obtain.
In conclusion, may I emphasize again that there is much work which
remains to be done on this question and that a lifetime would be all too
short to probe the many problems which present themselves. Is it too
much to hope that the succeeding twenty years may see further progress
along this line and that if the older generation finds it impossible to carry
on such studies, the younger economists may find such lines of
inquiry a challenge to their ingenuity and abilities?3' I have always
been struck by the old Hindu saying, "This is no door but only a little
window that opens out upon a great world." Since this is peculiarly
applicable to the studies which I have attempted, upon that note I shall
end.


---Economics-1949-0-03.txt---
I
A hundred years ago economists were much more pleased with
their performance than they are today. But I submit that, if com-
placency can ever be justified, there is much more reason for being
complacent today than there was then or even a quarter of a century
ago. As regards command of facts, both statistical and historical, this
is so obviously true that I need not insist. And if it be true of our
command of facts, it must be true also for all the applied fields that
for their advance mainly depend upon fact finding. I must insist,
however, on the proposition that our powers of analysis have grown
in step with our stock of facts. A new organon of statistical methods
has emerged, to some extent by our own efforts, that is bouind to mean
as much to us as it does to all the sciences, such as biology or experi-
mental psychology, the phenomena of which are given in terms of
frequency distributions. In response to this development and in al-
liance with it, as well as independently, our own box of analytic tools
has been greatly enriched: economic theory, in the instrumental sense
of the term-in which it means neither the teaching of ultimate ends
of policy nor explanatory hypotheses but simply the sum total of our
methods of handling facts-has grown quite as much as Marshall
and Pareto had foreseen that it would.
If this is not more generally recognized and if it is etiquette with
economists-let alone the public-to pass derogatory judgment on
the state of our science, this is owing to a number of causes that,
though known all too well, should be repeated: a building plot on
which old structures are being torn down and new ones erected is
not an esthetic thing to behold; moreover, to a most discouraging extent
the new structures are being currently discredited by premature at-
tempts at utilitarian application; finally, the building area widens so


---Economics-1949-0-04.txt---
that it becomes impossible for the individual worker to understand
everything that is going oni beyond his own small sector. It would
indeed be difficult to present in systematic form, as the Smiths, Mills,
and Marshalls have been able to do with more or less suiccess, a
comprehensive treatise that might display some measure of unity and
command all but universal approval. Thus, though the workers in
each sector are not at all displeased with how they are getting on
themselves, they are quite likely to disapprove of the manner in which
those in all the others go about their tasks, or even to deny that these
other tasks are worth bothering about at all. This is but natural. Many
types of mind are needed to build up the structure of human knowl-
edge, types which never quite understand one another. Science is
technique and the more it develops, the more completely does it pass
out of the range of comprehension not only of the public but, minus
his own chosen specialty, of the research worker himself. More or
less, this is so everywhere although greater uniformity of training
and greater discipline of endeavor may in physics reduce the tumult
to something like order. As everyone knows, however, there is with us
another source of confusion and another barrier to advance: most of
us, not content with their scientific task, yield to the call of public
duty and to their desire to serve their country and their age, and in
doing so bring into their work their individual schemes of values and
all their policies and politics-the whole of their moral personalities
up to their spiritual ambitions.
I am not going to reopen the old discussion on value judgments or
about the advocacy of group interests. On the contrary, it is essential
for my purpose to emphasize that in itself scientific performance does
not require us to divest ourselves of our value judgments or to re-
nounce the calling of an advocate of some particular interest. To
investigate facts or to develop tools for doing so is one thing; to
evaluate them from some moral or cultural standpoint is, in logic,
another thing, and the two need not conflict. Similarly, the advocate
of some interest may yet do honest analytic work, and the motive
of proving a point for the interest to which he owes allegiance does
not in itself prove anything for or against this analytic work: more
bluntly, advocacy does not imply lying. It spells indeed misconduct
to bend either facts or inferences from facts in order to make them
serve either an ideal or an interest. But such misconduct is not neces-
sarily inherent in a worker's arguing from "axiological premises" or
in advocacy per se.' Examples abound in which economists have estab-

---Economics-1949-0-05.txt---
lished propositions for the implications of which they did not have
any sympathy. To mention a single instance: to establish the logical
consistency of the conditions (equations) that are descriptive of a
socialist economy will seem to most people equivalent to gaining a
point for socialism; but it was established by Enrico Barone, a man
who, whatever else he may have been, was certainly no sympathizer
with socialist ideals or groups.
But there exist in our minds preconceptions about the economic
process that are much more dangerous to the cumulative growth of our
knowledge and the scientific character of our analytic endeavors be-
cause they seem beyond our control in a sense in which value judgments
and special pleadings are not. Though mostly allied with these, they
deserve to be separated from them and to be discussed independently.
We shall call them Ideologies.
II
The word ide'ologie was current in France toward the end of the
18th and in the first decade of the 19th century and meant much the
same thing as did the Scottish moral philosophy of the same and an
earlier time or as our own social science in that widest acceptance of
the term in which it includes psychology. Napoleon imparted a de-
rogatory meaning to it by his sneers at the ideologues-doctrinaire
dreamers without any sense for the realities of politics. Later on, it
was used as it is often used today in order to denote systems of ideas,
that is, in a way in which our distinction between ideologies and
value judgments is lost. We have nothing to do with these or any other
meanings except one that may be most readily introduced by ref-
erence to the "historical materialism" of Marx and Engels. According
to this doctrine, history is determined by the autonomous evolution
of the structure of production: the social and political organization,
religions, morals, arts and sciences are mere "ideological superstruc-
tures," generated by the economic process.
We neither need nor can go into the merits and demerits of this
conception as such2 of which only one feature is relevant to our pur-
pose. This feature is the one that has, through various transformations,
developed into the sociology of science of the type associated with the

---Economics-1949-0-06.txt---
names of Max Scheler and Karl Mannheim. Roughly up to the middle
of the 19th century the evolution of "science" had been looked upon
as a purely intellectual process-as a sequence of explorations of the
empirically given universe or, as we may also put it, as a process of
filiation of discoveries or analytic ideas that went on, thoughl no doubt
influencing social history and being influenced by it in many ways,
according to a law of its own. M1arx was the first to turn this relation
of interdependence between "science" and other departments of social
history into a relation of dependence of the former on the objective
data of the social structure and in particular on the social location
of scientific workers that determines their outlook upon reality and
hence what they see of it and how they see it. This kind of relativism-
which must of course not be confused with any other kind of relativ-
ism3-if rigorously carried to its logical consequences spells a new
philosophy of science and a new definition of scientific truth. Even for
mathematics and logic and still more for physics, the scientific worker's
choice of problems and' of approaches to them, hence the pattern of
an epoch's scientific thought, becomes socially conditioned-which is
precisely what we mean when speaking of scientific ideology rather
than of the ever more perfect perception of objective scientific truths.
Few will deny, however, that in the cases of logic, mathematics, and
physics the influence of ideological bias does not extend beyond that
choice of problems and approaches, that is to say, that the sociological
interpretation does not, at least for the last two or three centuries,
challenge the "objective truth" of the findings. This "objective truth"
may be, and currently is being, challenged on other grounds but not
on the ground that a given proposition is true only with reference to
the social location of the men who formulated it. To some extent at
least, this favorable situation may be accounted for by the fact that
logic, mathematics, physics and so on deal with experience that is
largely invariant to the observer's social location and practically in-
variant to historical change: for capitalist and proletarian, a falling
stone looks alike. The social sciences do not share this advantage. It
is possible, or so it seems, to challenge their findings not only on all
the grounds on which the propositions of all sciences may be challenged
but also on the additional one that they cannot convey more than a
writer's class affiliations and that, without reference to such class
affiliations, there is no room for the categories of true or false, hence
for the conception of "scientific advance" at all. Henceforth we adopt

---Economics-1949-0-07.txt---
the term Ideology or Ideological Bias for this-real or supposed-
state of things alone, and our problem is to ascertain the extent to
which ideological bias is or has been a factor in the development of
what-conceivably-it might be a misnomer to call scientific eco-
nomics.
In recognizing the ideological element it is possible to go to very
different lengths. There are a few writers who have in fact denied that
there is such a thing in economics as accumulation of a stock of
"correctly" observed facts and "true" propositions. But equally small
is the minority who would deny the influence of ideological bias en-
tirely. The majority of economists stand between these extremes: they
are ready enough to admit its presence though, like Marx, they find
it only in others and never in themselves; but they do not admit that
it is an inescapable curse and that it vitiates economics to its core.
It is precisely this intermediate position that raises our problem. For
ideologies are not simply lies; they are truthful statements about what
a man thinks he sees. Just as the medieval knight saw himself as he
wished to see himself and just as the modern bureaucrat does the
same and just as both failed and fail to see whatever may be adduced
against their seeing themselves as the defenders of the weak and
innocent and the sponsors of the Common Good, so every other social
group develops a protective ideology which is nothing if not sincere.
Ex hypothesi we are not aware of our rationalizations-how then is it
possible to recognize and to guard against them?
But let me repeat before I go on: I am speaking of science which is
technique that turns out the results which, together with value judg-
ments or preferences, produce recommendations, either individual ones
or systems of them-such as the systems of mercantilism, liberalism
and so on. I am not speaking of these value judgments and these
recommendations themselves. I fully agree with those who maintain
that judgments about ultimate values-about the Common Good, for
instance-are beyond the scientist's range except as objects of his-
torical study, that they are ideologies by nature and that the concept
of scientific progress can be applied to them only so far as the means
may be perfected that are to implement them. I share the conviction
that there is no sense in saying that the world of ideas of bourgeois
liberalism is "superior" in any relevant sense to the world of ideas of
the middle ages, or the world of ideas of socialism to that of bourgeois
liberalism. Actually, I further believe that there is no reason other than
personal preference for saying that more wisdom or knowledge goes
into our policies than went into those of the Tudors or Stuarts or, for
that matter, into Charlemagne's.

III
So soon as we have realized the possibility of ideological bias, it is
not difficult to locate it. All we have to do for this purpose is to
scrutinize scientific procedure. It starts from the perception of a set
of related phenomena which we wish to analyze and ends up-for the
time being-with a scientific model in which these phenomena are
conceptualized and the relations between them explicitly formulated,
either as assumptions or as propositions (theorems). This primitive
way of putting it may not satisfy the logician but it is all we need
for our hunt for ideological bias. Two things should be observed.
First, that perception of a set of related phenomena is a pre-
scientific act. It must be performed in order to give to our minds
something to do scientific work on-to indicate an object of research
-but it is not scientific in itself. But though prescientific, it is not
preanalytic. It does not simply consist in perceiving facts by one or
more of our senses. These facts must be recognized as having some
meaning or relevance that justifies our interest in them and they must
be recognized as related-so that we might separate them from others
-which involves some analytic work by our fancy or common sense.
This mixture of perceptions and prescientific analysis we shall call the
research worker's Vision or Intuition. In practice, of course, we hardly
ever start from scratch so that the prescientific act of vision is not
entirely our own. We start from the work of our predecessors or con-
temporaries or else from the ideas that float around us in the public
mind. In this case our vision will also contain at least some of the
results of previous scientific analysis. However, this compound is still
given to us and exists before we start scientific work ourselves.
Second, if I have identified with "model building" the scientific
analysis that operates upon the material proffered by the vision, I
must add at once that I intend to give the term "model" a very wide
meaning. The explicit economic model of our own day and its analoga
in other sciences are of course the product of late stages of scientific
endeavor. Essentially, however, they do not do anything that is not
present in the earliest forms of analytic endeavor which may therefore
also be said to have issued, with every individual worker, in primitive,
fragmentary, and inefficient models. This work consists in picking out
certain facts rather than others, in pinning them down by labeling
them, in accumulating further facts in order not only to supplement
but in part also to replace those originally fastened upon, in formulating
and improving the relations perceived-briefly, in "factual" and
"theoretical" research that go on in an endless chain of give and take,
the facts suggesting new analytic instruments (theories) and these
in turn carrying us toward the recognition of new facts. This is as


---Economics-1949-0-09.txt---
true when the object of our interest is an historical report as it is
when the object of our interest is to "rationalize" the Schr6dinger
equation though in any particular instance the task of fact finding or
the task of analyzing may so dominate the other as to almost
remove it from sight. Schoolmasters may try to make this clearer to
their pupils by talking about induction and deduction and even set the
one against the other, creating spurious problems thereby. The essential
thing, however we may choose to interpret it, is the "endless give and
take" between the clear concept and the cogent conclusion on the one
hand, and the new fact and the handling of its variability on the other.
Now, so soon as we have performed the miracle of knowing what we
cannot know, namely the existence of the ideological bias in ourselves
and others, we can trace it to a simple source. This source is in the
initial vision of the phenomena we propose to subject to scientific
treatment. For this treatment itself is under objective control in the
sense that it is always possible to establish whether a given statement,
in reference to a given state of knowledge, is provable, refutable, or
neither. Of course this does not exclude honest error or dishonest
faking. It does not exclude delusions of a wide variety of types. But
it does permit the exclusion of that particular kind of delusion which
we call ideology because the test involved is indifferent to any ideology.
The original vision, on the other hand, is under no such control. There,
the elements that will meet the tests of analysis are, by definition,
undistinguishable from those that will not or-as we may also put
it since we admit that ideologies may contain provable truth up to
100 per cent-the original vision is ideology by nature and may contain
any amount of delusions traceable to a man's social location, to the
manner in which he wants to see himself or his class or group and
the opponents of his own class or group. This should be extended even
to peculiarities of his outlook that are related to his personal tastes
and conditions and have no group connotation-there is even an
ideology of the mathematical mind as well as an ideology of the mind
that is allergic to mathematics.
It may be useful to reformulate our problem before we discuss
examples. Since the source of ideology is our pre- and extrascientific
vision of the economic process and of what is-causally or teleologi-
cally-important in it and since normally this vision is then subjected
to scientific treatment, it is being either verified or destroyed by
analysis and in either case should vanish qua ideology. How far, then,
does it fail to disappear as it should? How far does it hold its own
in the face of accumulating adverse evidence? And how far does it vitiate
our analytic procedure itself so that, in the result, we are still left
with knowledge that is impaired by it?


---Economics-1949-0-10.txt---
From tlhe outset it is clear that there is a vast expanse of ground
on which there should be as little danger of ideological vitiation as
there is in physics. A time series of gross investment in manufacturing
industry may be good or bad, but whether it is the one or the other is,
normally, open to anyone to find out. The Walrasian system as it
stands may or may not admit of a unique set of solutions but whether
it does or not is a matter of exact proof that every qualified person
can repeat. Questions like these may not be the most fascinating or
practically most urgent ones but they constitute the bulk of what is
specifically scientific in our work. And they are in logic although
not always in fact neutral to ideology. Moreover, their sphere widens
as our understanding of analytic work improves. Time was when
economists thought that they were gaining or losing a point for labor
if they fought for the labor-quantity and against the marginal-utility
theory of value. It can be shown that, so far as ideologically relevant
issues are concerned, this makes as little difference as did the replace-
ment of the latter by the indifference-curve approach or the replace-
ment of the indifference curves by a simple consistency postulate
(Samuelson). I dare say that there are still some who find something
incongruous to their vision in marginal-productivity analysis. Yet it
can be shown that the latter's purely formal apparatus is compatible
with any vision of economic reality that anyone ever had.4
IV
Let us now look for ideological elements in three of the most influen-
tial structures of economic thought, the works of Adam Smith, of
Marx, and of Keynes.
In Adam Smith's case the interesting thing is not indeed the absence
but the harmlessness of ideological bias. I am not referring to his
time- and country-bound practical wisdom about laissez-faire, free
trade, colonies and the like for-it cannot be repeated too often-a
man's political preferences and recommendations as such are entirely
beyond the range of my remarks or rather they enter this range only
so far as the factual and theoretical analysis does that is presented in
support of them. I am exclusively referring to this analytical work


---Economics-1949-0-11.txt---
itself-only to his indicatives, not to his imperatives. This being under-
stood, the first question that arises is what kind of ideology we are
to attribute to him. Proceeding on the Marxist principle we shall look
to his social location, that is, to his personal and ancestral class
affiliations and in addition to the class connotation of the influences
that may have formed or may have helped to form what we have
called his vision. He was a homo academicus who became a civil
servant. His people were more or less of a similar type: his family, not
penniless but neither wealthy, kept up some standard of education
and fell in with a well-known group in the Scotland of his day. Above
all it did not belong to the business class. His general outlook on
things social and economic reproduced these data to perfection. He
beheld the economic process of his time with a cold critical eye and
instinctively looked for mechanical rather than personal factors of
explanation-such as division of labor. His attitude to the land-owning
and to the capitalist classes was the attitude of the observer from outside
and he made it pretty clear that he considered the landlord (the "sloth-
ful" landlord who reaps where he has not sown) as an unnecessary,
and the capitalist (who hires "industrious people" and provides them
with subsistence, raw materials, and tools) as a necessary evil. The
latter necessity was rooted in the virtue of parsimony, eulogy of which
evidently came from the bottom of his Scottish soul. Apart from this,
his sympathies went wholly to the laborer who "clothes everybody
and himself goes in rags." Add to this the disgust he felt-like all
the people in his group-at the inefficiency of the English bureaucracy
and at the corruption of the politicians and you have practically all
of his ideological vision. While I cannot stay to show how much this
explains of the picture he drew, I must emphasize that the other
component of this vision, the natural-law philosophy that he imbibed
in his formative years, the product of similarly conditioned men, in-
fluenced the ideological background from which he wrote in a similar
manner-natural freedom of action, the workman's natural right to
the whole product of industry, individualistic rationalism and so on,
all this was taught to him ere his critical faculties were developed
but there was hardly need to teach him these things for they came
"naturally" to him in the air he breathed. But-and this is the really
interesting point-all this ideology, however strongly held, really
did not much harm to his scientific achievement. Unless we go to him
for economic sociology,5 we receive from him sound factual and analytic
teaching that no doubt carries date but is not open to objection on the
score of ideological bias. There is some semiphilosophical foliage of


---Economics-1949-0-12.txt---
an ideological nature but it can be removed without injury to his
scientific argument. The analysis that supports his qualified free-trade
conclusions is not-as it was with some contemporaneous philosophers,
such as Morellet-based upon the proposition that by nature a man
is free to buy or to sell where he pleases. The statement that the
(whole) produce is the natural compensation of labor occurs, but no
analytic use is made of it-everywhere the ideology spends itself in
phraseology and for the rest recedes before scientific research. In part
at least, this was the merit of the man: he was nothing if not respon-
sible; and his sober and perhaps somewhat dry common sense gave
him respect for facts and logic. In part it was good fortune: it matters
little if his analysis has to be given up as the psychology it was meant
to be if at the same time it must be retained as a logical schema of
economic behavior-on closer acquaintance, the homo economicus (so
far as Adam Smith, the author of the Moral Sentiments, can in fact
be credited or debited with this conception at all) turns out to be a
very harmless man of straw.
Marx was the economist who discovered ideology for us and who
understood its nature. Fifty years before Freud, this was a perform-
ance of the first order. But, strange to relate, he was entirely blind to
its dangers so far as he himself was concerned. Only other people, the
bourgeois economists and the utopian socialists, were victims of
ideology. At the same time, the ideological character of his premises
and the ideological bias of his argument are everywhere obvious. Even
some of his followers (Mehring, for instance) recognized this. And
it is not difficult to describe his ideology. He was a bourgeois radical
who had broken away from bourgeois radicalism. He was formed by
German philosophy and did not feel himself to be a professional
economist until the end of the 1840's. But by that time, that is to say,
before his serious analytic work had begun, his vision of the capitalist
process had become set and his scientific work was to implement, not
to correct it. It was not original with him. It pervaded the radical
circles of Paris and may be traced back to a number of 18th century
writers, such as Linguet.6 History conceived as the struggle between
classes that are defined as haves and havenots, with exploitation of the
one by the other, ever increasing wealth among ever fewer haves and
ever increasing misery and degradation among the havenots, moving
with inexorable necessity toward spectacular explosion, this was the
vision then conceived with passionate energy and to be worked up,
like a raw material is being worked up, by means of the scientific
tools of his time. This vision implies a number of statements that will

---Economics-1949-0-13.txt---
not stand the test of analytic controls. And, in fact, as his analytic
work matured, Marx not only elaborated many pieces of scientific
analysis that were neutral to that vision but also some that did not
agree with it well-for instance, he got over the kind of underconsump-
tion and the kind of overproduction theories of crises which he seems
to have accepted at first and traces of which-to puzzle interpreters-
remained in his writings throughout. Other results of his analysis he
introduced by means of the device of retaining the original-ideo-
logical-statement as an "absolute" (i.e., abstract) law while admitting
the existence of counteracting forces which accounted for deviating
phenomena in real life. Some parts of the vision, finally, took refuge
in vituperative phraseology that does not affect the scientific elements
in an argument. For instance, whether right or wrong, his exploitation
theory of "surplus" value was a genuine piece of theoretical analysis.
But all the glowing phrases about exploitation could have been at-
tached just as well to other theories, B6hm-Bawerk's among them:
imagine Bohm-Bawerk in Marx's skin, what could have been easier
for him than to pour out the vials of his wrath on the infernal practice
of robbing labor by means of deducting from its product a time
discount?
But some elements of his original vision-in particular the increasing
misery of the masses which was what was to goad them into the final
revolution-that were untenable were at the same time indispensable
for him. They were too closely linked to the innermost meaning of
his message, too deeply rooted in the very meaning of his life, to be
ever discarded. Moreover, they were what appealed to followers and
what called forth their fervent allegiance. It was they which explain
the organizing effect-the party-creating effect-of what without them
would have been stale and lifeless. And so we behold in this case the
victory of ideology over analysis: all the consequences of a vision that
turns into a social creed and thereby renders analysis sterile.
Keynes' vision-the source of all that has been and is more or less
definitely identified as Keynesianism-appeared first in a few thought-
ful paragraphs in the introduction to the Consequences of the Peace
(1920). These paragraphs created modern stagnationism-stagnation-
ist moods had been voiced, at intervals, by many economists before,
from Britannia Languens on (1680)-and indicate its essential fea-
tures, the features of mature and arteriosclerotic capitalist society that
tries to save more than its declining opportunities for investment can
absorb. This vision never vanished again-we get another glimpse of
it in the tract on Monetary Reform and elsewhere but, other problems
absorbing Keynes' attention during the 1920's, it was not implemented
analytically until much later. D. H. Robertson in his Banking Policy


---Economics-1949-0-14.txt---
and the Price Level presented some work that amounted to partial
implementation of the idea of abortive saving. But with Keynes this
idea remained a side issue even in the Treatise on Money. Perhaps
it was the shock imparted by the world crisis which definitely broke
the bonds that prevented him from fully verbalizing himself. Certainly
it was the shock imparted by the world crisis which created the public
for a message of this kind.
Again it was the ideology-the vision of decaying capitalism that
located (saw) the cause of the decay in one out of a large number of
features of latter-day society-which appealed and won the day,
and not the analytic implementation by the book of 1936 which, by
itself and without the protection it found in the wide appeal of the
ideology, would have suffered much more from the criticisms that were
directed against it almost at once. Still, the conceptual apparatus was
the work not only of a brilliant but also of a mature mind-of
a Marshallian who was one of the three men who had shared the sage's
mantle between them. Throughout the 1920's Keynes was and felt
himself to be a Marshallian and even though he later on renounced
his allegiance dramatically, he never deviated from the Marshallian
line more than was strictly necessary in order to make his point.
He continued to be what he had become by 1914, a master of the
theorist's craft, and he was thus able to provide his vision with an
armour that prevented many of his followers from seeing the ideo-
logical element at all. Of course this now expedites the absorption of
Keynes' contribution into the current stream of analytic work. There
are no really new principles to absorb. The ideology of underemploy-
ment equilibrium and of non-spending which is a better term to
use than saving-is readily seen to be embodied in a few restrictive
assumptions that emphasize certain (real or supposed) facts. With these
everyone can deal as he thinks fit and for the rest he can continue his
way. This reduces Keynesian controversies to the level of technical
science. Lacking institutional support, the "creed" has petered out
with the situation that had made it convincing. Even the most stalwart
McCullochs of our day are bound to drift into one of those positions
of which it is hard to say whether they involve renunciation, reinter-
pretation, or misunderstanding of the original message.
V
Our examples might suggest that analytically uncontrolled ideas
play their role exclusively in the realm of those broad conceptions of
the economic process as a whole that constitute the background from
which analytic effort sets out and of which we never succeed in fully
mastering more than segments. This is of course true to some extent-


---Economics-1949-0-15.txt---
the bulk of our research work deals with particulars that give less
scope to mere vision and are more strictly controlled by objective tests-
but not wholly so. Take, for instance, the theory of saving which does
appear in a wider context in the Keynesian system but might also,
factually and theoretically, be treated by itself. From the time of
Turgot and Smith-in fact from still earlier times-to the time of
Keynes all the major propositions about its nature and effects have,
by slow accretion, been assembled so that, in the light of the richer
supply of facts we command today, there should be little room left
for difference of opinion. It should be easy to draw up a summarizing
(though perhaps not very exciting) analysis that the large majority of
professional economists might accept as a matter of course. But there
is, and always has been, eulogistic or vituperative preaching on the
subject that, assisted by terminological tricks such as the confusion
between saving and nonspending, has succeeded in producing a sham
antagonism between the writers on the subject. Much emphasized dif-
ferences in doctrine for which there is no factual or analytical basis
always indicate, though in themselves they do not prove, the presence
of ideological bias on one side or on both-which in this case hails
from two different attitudes to the bourgeois scheme of life.
Another instance of sectional ideology of this kind is afforded by
the attitude of many, if not most economists, toward anything in any
way connected with monopoly (oligopoly) and cooperative price set-
ting (collusion). This attitude has not changed since Aristotle and
Molina although it has acquired a partially new meaning under the
conditions of modern industry. Now as then, a majority of economists
would subscribe to Molina's dictum: monopoliuim est injustum et rei
publicae injuriosum. But it is not this value judgment which is rele-
vant to my argument-one may dislike modern largest-scale business
exactly as one may dislike many other features of modern civilization
-but the analysis that leads up to it and the ideological influence
that this analysis displays. Anyone who has read Marshall's Principles,
still more anyone who has also read his Industry and Trade, should
know that among the innumerable patterns that are covered by those
terms there are many of which benefit and not injury to economic
efficiency and the consumers' interest ought to be predicated. More
modern analysis permits to show still more clearly that no sweeping
or unqualified statement can be true for all of them; and that the
mere facts of size, single-sellership, discrimination, and cooperative
price setting are in themselves inadequate for asserting that the
resulting performance is, in any relevant sense of the word, inferior
to the one which could be expected under pure competition in condi-
tions attainable under pure competition-in other words, that economic


---Economics-1949-0-16.txt---
analysis offers no material in support of indiscriminate "trust busting"
and that such material must be looked for in the particular circum-
stances of each individual case. Nevertheless, many economists support
such indiscriminate "trust busting" and the interesting point is that
enthusiastic sponsors of the private-enterprise system are particularly
prominent among them. Theirs is the ideology of a capitalist economy
that would fill its social functions admirably by virtue of the magic
wand of pure competition were it not for the monster of monopoly or
oligopoly that casts a shadow on an otherwise bright scene. No argu-
ment avails about the performance of largest-scale business, about
the inevitability of its emergence, about the social costs involved in
destroying existing structures, about the futility of the hallowed ideal
of pure competition- or in fact ever elicits any response other than
most obviously sincere indignation.
Even as thus extended, our examples, wlhile illustrating well enough
what ideology is, are quite inadequate to give us an idea of the range of
its influence. The influence shows nowhere more strongly than in
economic history which displays the traces of ideological premises so
clearly, precisely because they are rarely formulated in so many words,
hence rarely challenged-the subject of the role that is to be attributed
in economic development to the initiative of governments, policies,
and politics affords an excellent instance: groupwise, economic his-
torians have systematically over- or understated the importance of this
initiative in a manner that points unequivocally to prescientific con-
victions. Even statistical inference loses the objectivity that should in
good logic characterize it whenever ideologically relevant issues are
at stake.7 And some of the sociological, psychological, anthropological,
biological waters that wash our shores are so vitiated by ideological
bias that, beholding the state of things in parts of those fields, the
economist might sometimes derive solace from comparison. Had we
time, we could everywhere observe the same phenomenon: that ideolo-
gies crystallize, that they become creeds which for the time being are
impervious to argument; that they find defenders whose very souls
go into the fight for them.
There is little comfort in postulating, as has been done sometimes,
the existence of detached minds that are immune to i-deological bias
and ex hypothesi able to overcome it. Such minds may actually exist

---Economics-1949-0-17.txt---
and it is in fact easy to see that certain social groups are further
removed than are others from those ranges of social life in which
ideologies acquire additional vigor in economic or political conflict. But
though they may be relatively free from the ideologies of the prac-
titioners, they develop not less distorting ideologies of their own. There
is more comfort in the observation that no economic ideology lasts
forever and that, with a likelihood that approximates certainty, we
eventually grow out of each. This follows not only from the fact that
social patterns change and that hence every economic ideology is bound
to wither but also from the relation that ideology bears to that pre-
scientific cognitive act which we have called vision. Since this act
induces fact finding and analysis and since these tend to destroy what-
ever will not stand their tests, no economic ideology could survive
indefinitely even in a stationary social world. As time wears on and
these tests are being perfected, they do their work more quickly and
more effectively. But this still leaves us with the result that some
ideology will always be with us and so, I feel convinced, it will.
But this is no misfortune. It is pertinent to remember another aspect
of the relation between ideology and vision. That prescientific cognitive
act which is the source of our ideologies is also the prerequisite of our
scientific work. No new departure in any science is possible without
it. Through it we acquire new material for our scientific endeavors
and something to formulate, to defend, to attack. Our stock of facts and
tools grows and rejuvenates itself in the process. And so-though we
proceed slowly because of our ideologies, we might not proceed at all
without them.


---Economics-1950-0-03.txt---
The proposition to which I should like to draw attention is not novel.
But in these days of physical planning and social priorities, it may not
be amiss to recall something ancient, if it is something relevant. And
that is that economic analysis rests fundamentally upon individual
choice; and where the individual cannot choose, economics does not
exist. Economics is concerned with the application of scarce resources to
unlimited wants. Costs, utility or indifference calculations, saving and
consuming, investing and hoarding, altering productive proportions,
introducing new combinations-in all the manifold aspects of the eco-
nomic problem, the key phenomenon is choice.
Choices in these matters can be made collectively. But there is cer-
tainly a narrower and very significant sense in which choice is only in-
dividual; and it is this kind of choice which economics, in contrast to
ethics and politics, takes for its subject matter. A moral law, enforced
by public censure or approval, limits the choice of individuals. A politi-
cal decision or law, even in a democracy except in the rare case of
unanimity, also limits individual choice. But an economic generalization
describes individual choice and its results. This does not mean that there
should be neither moral nor political law; it merely asserts the contrast
between moral and political on the one hand and economic on the other.
To the determinist in general or in social philosophy, a contrast based
on free will would, of course, be inadmissible. But I am content to speak
in commonsense terms. There is significance-and indeed very deep
significance-in the statement that the moral injunction to speak the
truth limits the freedom of the individual to say whatever he chooses,
even though he voluntarily accepts the principle as categoric. In political
matters a tax law, though resting upon free political choice in a parlia-


---Economics-1950-0-04.txt---
mentary state, abridges the freedom of the individual to spend his
money as he chooses. Economic laws do not abridge but rather describe
the choice of individuals and the outgrowth of these choices in market
phenomena.
This same contrast appears when we shift our viewpoint from a
generic to a quantitative basis. Even when ethical or political law
indicates a direction of choice which the individual would elect if left
to his own free choice, it cannot in the nature of the case result in the
same quantitative solution, except quite by accident. Thus a moral
code may impose temperance in the consumption of alcoholic drinks;
but the individual's acceptance of the principle does not give any
precise quantitative solution. A public spirited person may vote for a
social security program, recognize that it must be supported by taxa-
tion, and yet try to avoid paying a larger sum in personal income tax
than necessary. Generally speaking, the expression of choice through
the ballot, whether at the popular or parliamentary level, becomes less
and less comfortable to the free choice of each individual, the larger
the group to which the measure is applied. Political decisions, by their
very nature, involve choices made for groups, and are thus at best
approximations of what and how much the individuals would choose.
Economic decisions are, on the other hand, marginal-that is, they
conform to "the little more, the little less."
"The little more, the little less" lies at the heart of economic thinking
-in the analysis of income allocation, of costs of production, of outlays
on advertising and other selling devices, of spending vs. saving, of in-
vesting vs. hoarding money, and the like. But the "little more and the
little less" has, practically speaking, to be a matter of individual de-
cision, since decisions on a moral or political basis almost certainly
involve, by comparison to individual budgets, very gross magnitudes.
Economics is thus individualistic in a profound sense.
Most wants, beyond some very primitive physical urges, are "social
wants" in the sense of their being imbued with the tastes, morals, and
customs of the surrounding society. But the subject of these wants
is still the individual. The same is true of "collective wants," that is,
wants which either can (practically) be satisfied only by processes
which result in the production of the good or service for a number of
people, or which require a number of participants in the enjoyment of
the product. The subject of the want is still the individual. Economic
guidance of production for wants of these characters still requires a
free-market expression of preferences.'


---Economics-1950-0-05.txt---
Is this just a peculiar form of words, which I propose? Could not
most of the decisions which I have labelled political and ethical, as well
as those more narrow economic choices, be embraced under a broader
and more flexible concept of things economic? Such an alternative
set of definitions would, indeed, be possible. But it would still be neces-
sary to give a distinctive designation to the study of free individual
choice in matters of production, a freedom which, as I have emphasized,
differs qualitatively and quantitatively from moral and political choices.
Thus the competing terminology would come out with the same sub-
stantive distinctions as my own, which has the decided advantage of
conforming to common understanding.
In describing economics as concerned with the processes and results
of individual free choice on the market, I differ significantly from the
description given by Lionel Robbins that economics deals with the
application of scarce resources to given ends.2 Robbins' description
would, for example, include the analysis of productive effort to serve
the ends given arbitrarily-and let us say for present purposes, whimsi-
cally and sadistically-by an absolute dictator. But this is not econom-
ics. What makes resources "scarce"? And what determines their
"4economic" application, if it is not the attitudes of individuals toward
supplying their services, and their own evaluations of products aside
from and independently of the dictates of authority, whether that
authority be "duly constituted" or not. Alternatively, one may express
the same idea by saying that Robbins' definition errs in accepting any
and all "given ends"; one end must be stipulated by economics itself,
and that is the freedom of the individual to make the best of his situa-
tion as a producer or consumer, so far as this does not entail greater
loss of freedom upon other inidividuals.
The individualistic predilection of economics does not, however, com-
mit economists to a laissez-faire, Manchestrian, or "reactionary" posi-
tion. Some decisions concerning economic problems have to be political,
for no one except an anarchist could deny that perfect freedom of
individual choice occasionally leads to results unacceptable to the com-
munity. Economists may thus range from extensive interventionists to
"hard boiled" liberals, according as they think these occasions to be
numerous or few. There are indeed strong grounds for supposing that
the occasions might be quite numerous merely for one reason alone
that free individual choice is quite as likely to take the direction of an
effort to monopolize as to compete.
An individual or firm possessed of monopoly power does not always
press this advantage to the maximum, indeed frequently does not press


---Economics-1950-0-06.txt---
it very far. But if the monopolist "acts like a monopolist" and his
monopoly pertains to an important commodity or service, there usually
ensues a political decision which suppresses this individual's free choice.
It is significant for the validity of my thesis, however, that this decision
characteristically takes the form of attempting to supplant the monopoly
by competition, or of attempting to regulate the monopoly and to simu-
late competitive results. In either event the aim is to restore results
similar to those which would appear on the market from the free choice
of individuals, except for the offending monopolist.
Economics has successfully described the outcome of competitive
market situations where individual choice is free. Its success in analyzing
various hues of monopoly varies in about an inverse proportion as
monopoly elements grow and free choice dwindles. Thus simple mo-
nopoly, with freedom as to price or amount purchased on the demand
side, yields a definite solution. Two-sided monopoly with each mo-
nopolist having the power to dictate price but not quantity yields a
determinate solution of quantity but the division of the price is inde-
terminate. Between these extremes and competition are intermediate
cases where not one but several producers dominate the market; and
for these cases, theoretical economics is able to state only zones or
areas of probable solutions on various suppositions as to the freedom of
choice of the individual firms. Efforts to press the frontier of economic
analysis farther into this territory are, of course, welcome and neces-
sary. But as we pass gradually from situations in which economic ac-
tivity is guided by individual free choice toward more (uncontrolled)
monopoly and toward more political choice, the substance of economics
comes to be more and more prescinded and more tentative. At the
limit, where all economic activity is controlled by the state and all
decisions are political, economics expires and the economist is put out to
grass. He no longer has any criteria of income allocation, costs, money
holdings, savings, foreign trade, etc., which he could use to test the
arbitrary decisions of the authority. If asked to appraise the efficiency
of the controlled economy, he would have to ask for the restoration of
free choice in one or many fields, in order to permit him to see how
matters actually stand. Thus there undoubtedly is such a thing as a
government economist, but only by virtue of the fact that enough deci-
sions are made outside the government to permit government decisions
to be tested by economic criteria.
The thesis which I maintain can now be briefly restated. Economics
studies the application of limited resources to wants which are less
limited. The limitation of resources reveals itself in costs; and at bottom
all costs excepting natural resources are human, that is, they are costs
to individual beings. At bottom, also, unsatisfied wants are the wants of


---Economics-1950-0-07.txt---
individual beings. Only to the degree that these costs and utilities to
individuals can express themselves in the market can economic analysis
exist. To the degree that political or ethical norms rule the market, to
the same degree does the possibility of applying economic criteria recede
or vanish.
II
I propose to test the validity of this proposition by reference to four
concepts of maximum or optimum solutions to be found in current
economics. To the economic way of thinking, "optimum" implies or
should imply the best application of limited resources to our less limited,
i.e., practically unlimited, wants. Of course this central problem takes
many aspects or dimensions; and consequently economic analysis is not
constrained to state just one optimum. The four concepts chosen for
purposes of the argument illlustrate different dimensions of the economic
problem; but they also illustrate the central theorem that where politics
and ethics come in by the window, economics goes out by the door.
Let us begin with one of the oldest-and currently one of the most
maligned-of these optima, the so-called "doctrine of maximum satis-
faction." In non-technical language this principle states that, if left
to their free choices, both consumers and producers will so allocate
expenditure that the return in any one line of outlay, either in direct
satisfaction from the good or in expected product, will not be less than
could be obtained from any other line of expenditure. Thus total satis-
faction is a maximum, being a maximum for each individual. All
economists state this principle with certain qualifications, and some
economists regard the qualifications to be so extensive as to leave
nothing of the original proposition. Those who would go so far would,
I believe, be forced to conclude also that the aggregate of individuals
accomplishes nothing in the effort toward a rational disposition of
their limited resources toward satisfying wants, i.e., we are unable to
economize, and economics is nothing.
But this is a vast overstatement. Monopoly qualifies the principle, or
more accurately limits its inclusiveness, for free choice is stipulated
within the principle itself and monopoly abridges free exchange. But
we are very far indeed from universal monopoly. Inequality of wealth
and income also qualifies the principle but in a much less extensive
fashion than commonly supposed. For to the degree that inequality
is functional, that is, to the degree to which it is necessary to pay one
man more than another to evoke his services, the national income or
aggregate of satisfactions to be divided out is increased over what it
would be with equal incomes. Unearned income from inherited wealth
or from illegal or sharp practices thus qualifies the maximizing of
product and satisfactions. Anyone may make his own guess as to how


---Economics-1950-0-08.txt---
large a fraction of personal income in the United States, at the present
level of $211 billions, is unearned. The facts that 82%o of this total is
embraced under wages, salaries and proprietorship incomes, and that
certainly not all the remainder (in pure property income) can be
regarded as unearned, may afford a cue to the answer. Finally, the
principle has to be qualified for consumer caprice, habit, ignorance, and
other impairments of rational behavior. Let me, however, recall the
familiar lines of Wordsworth:
The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.
In other words, we are typically far too much preoccupied with realiz-
ing the principle of maximum satisfaction; and it would indeed be sur-
prising if we did not in large measure accomplish our intent.
In fine, then, maximum satisfaction encounters the barriers of con-
sumer ignorance and irrationality, unearned income, and monopoly.
The materialism of our present age with its remorseless urge toward
higher standards of physical well-being and comfort does not seem to
connote either caprice or inertia on the part of consumers. Unearned
income seems to be ubiquitous; but it is a familiar story that the largest
part of the national income accrues to the poor and to the moderately
well-to-do, and not all income accruing even to the rich is unearned.
Finally, monopoly and monopoly factors permeate nearly all production,
but these elements have a visibility much more marked than the hum-
drum homogeneity of competition. I offer no apology for the wastes
and abuses of our present economic society. But the ardor with which
the American public threw off the constraints imposed by wartime price
controls, rationing, and allocations would seem to indicate that consumer
and producer free choice means something valuable. Consequently the
principle of maximum satisfaction-for all its existing lets and hind-
rances-still embodies a truth worth the telling.
The concepts of economic optimum which follow are inferior to
maximum satisfaction, if we employ as a criterion the effectiveness with
which a society applies its limited resources to its wants; and no alterna-
tive economic criterion presents itself. In the "second best" position I
would present the idea of "appropriate fluctuations of output," in the
words of that most eminent English economist, D. H. Robertson.3
Underlying this idea is the conviction, common to nearly all economists,
that the alternation of good and bad times is intimately associated with
waves of technical innovation and the episodic stimulation of new
investment. The process of purely scientific discovery probably goes on


---Economics-1950-0-09.txt---
at a fairly uniform rate; but the effective application of pure science
to practical and marketable products and the active creation and
exploiting of new markets in a private enterprise economy, as Schumpe-
ter has shown, awaits the discerning business venturer. Thereafter, the
perfecters and imitators crowd in, this particular market is gradually
pressed to the replacement demand stage, and the strong stimulus to
new investment ebbs away.
In a best of all possible worlds it might be possible to achieve com-
plete stability of production and a maximum rate of technical progress
at the same time. But if we take into account business optimism engen-
dered by the advent of some notable technological innovation such as,
for example, the automobile, and the spread of this stimulus to bankers,
family budget-makers, security traders, builders, exporters and im-
porters, and even to government spending authorities, we would not
be surprised to find the expansion running off into overly-full employ-
ment, inflation, bottlenecks, and wrong estimates, resulting in short-
ages in some sectors and overproduction elsewhere. So powerful are
these disequilibrating forces that to control them completely might
involve an intolerable degree of regimentation and might even stifle
the impulses toward economic progress. Consequently, we will probably
strike a compromise between continuous full employment and the most
rapid rate of progress by accepting some fluctuations, while striving
to keep them from developing into feverish speculative booms, followed
by disastrous and protracted periods of unemployment.
The concept of appropriate fluctuations may be regarded from the
angle of individual free choice. The history of business fluctuations
demonstrates that giving completely free rein to private decisions to
spend and invest will result in an intolerable degree of instability.
Marxians and contemporary communists confidently believe that
capitalism will one day be swept away in a catastrophic depression:
the only cure of instability is the totalitarian state. But this has not
been the diagnosis and prognosis of economics. Instability in the be-
havior of general aggregates such as the price level, spending, invest-
ment, and employment can be governed by similarly general measures-
monetary policy, fiscal policy, wage policy, and the like. Keynesian and
traditional economists alike reject the necessity of the piecemeal regula-
tion of business, industries, and occupations. Free choice is indeed
abridged by fiscal, monetary, and wage policy, but in impersonal and
nondiscriminatory ways. Thus in a quite understandable sense-since
unemployment and stagnant markets can scarcely be regarded as
things which anyone would freely elect-the policies designed to reduce
fluctuations to a tolerable or "appropriate" amplitude are also policies
maximizing the field of free choice over the long run.


---Economics-1950-0-10.txt---
The two optima thus far reviewed are primarily economic in content:
they represent situations without particular moral or political flavor
which, in significant senses, result mainly from individual choice. In
these cases the interference of the state has for its purpose the widen-
ing or extending of the field of individual choice, and not "ulterior"
ends. Alternatively, it might be said that with respect to these two
optima the political choices have for their aim the improved operation of
individual economic choice. These characteristics fade away pro-
gressively as we proceed to two further concepts of optimum.
I refer first to the "optimum propensity to save," a magnitude im-
plicit in the Keynesian general equilibrium theory, first made explicit by
Oscar Lange.4 The idea of an optimum amount of saving is a part of the
theory which attributes cyclical depression or longer-run stagnation to
over-saving. Optimum saving is that amount which is compatible with
full employment without inflation: more saving would spell a relapse
from full employment, and less saving would spell inflation.5
From the interested angle of the present argument, the peculiarity of
this optimum is that it runs directly counter to individual free choice. I
do not make an appeal to some mysterious "natural law" or invisible
hand; I merely assert that with human beings as they are, some of them
spendthrift and some of them frugal, Western civilization generally
reveals-aside from wars and other disasters-a tendency toward net
accumulation. With the very rich, it may appear simply as a residuum
after all consumption demands are satisfied. With some persons, again
more frequently found amongst the rich or quite well-to-do, it may arise
from the desire to grow wealthy or more wealthy for purposes of dis-
play, controlling other people's lives, or playing the game with higher
stakes. But again, as in an earlier context, we encounter the fact that
not only is most of the national income received by the moderately and
the less well-to-do, but also that these income classes account for the
largest part of savings. With them the motives thus far mentioned are
exceptional and the one overwhelmingly important purpose is provision
for the future.
Now an economic optimum which runs in terms of limiting this
activity is indeed a paradoxical kind of optimum. Providing security
against the rainy day and old age from the fruits of one's own produc-
tive activity may be an old-fashioned virtue, but it nevertheless pro-
vides substantial net social saving. This does not imply opposition to

---Economics-1950-0-11.txt---
"social security" measures; but these measures should supplement and
not supplant individual self-reliance. Amongst the several major vari-
ables which combine to produce downturns in economic activity or to
protract depression, we can surely select more promising channels of
public policy than influencing saving. In the first place, even the pro-
ponents of the over-saving thesis regard the growth of capital equip-
ment as an earmark of economic progress; and hence consistency would
demand primary emphasis upon inducing private investment sufficient
to absorb savings, or supplementing this with public investment if need
be-but in no event limiting saving. Secondly, saving rests upon in-
grained habit or long-standing business mores and cannot readily be
adjusted to short-term variations. But thirdly, when alternatives exist
which do not abridge individual choice, and when their effectiveness is
not less, they are clearly preferable.
Monetary and fiscal policies to stablize economic activity are actually
more effective because they operate quickly; and they do not abridge
individual choice in the direct and objectionable fashion of policies to
limit saving. Monetary policy consists directly of influencing the quan-
tity of money and hence indirectly the rate of spending. Fiscal policy
consists directly of influencing the rate of spending through the power-
ful government sector, and indirectly the quantity of money. Individual
economic choice does not, except in a minor way and need not at all, in-
fluence the quantity of money; and individual economic choice does not
determine government revenue and expenditure. Hence, in policies to
achieve economic stability through Federal Reserve and Treasury opera-
tions, we are not significantly abridging the choices which the eco-
nomic agents-individuals, businesses, state and local governments-
regard as matters for their own disposition. Economic activity under
private enterprise in a progressive economy is not self-stabilizing and it
requires political decisions to bring about an even evolution. But
amongst eligible alternatives there is no apology for making the politi-
cal decision gratuitously abridge individual free choice. The "optimum
propensity to save" does precisely this.
The fourth optimum to be considered is the notion of an "optimum
rate of (foreign) exchange," first promulgated, so far as I know, by Mrs.
Robinson.6 The idea is advanced rather incidentally and I do not pro-
pose to give it more than illustrative significance. Furthermore, this rate,
defined as the one which-wage rates and other underlying factors being
given-causes the favorable balance of trade to be a maximum, is ex-
plicitly said "by no means necessarily [to be] the most desirable rate
from every point of view." Thus it may involve lower real income per

---Economics-1950-0-12.txt---
unit of output than a somewhat higher rate of exchange. But there still
remains the implication that, in some significant sense, a maximum fa-
vorable balance of trade and its accompanying exchange rate are
optimal. What is this sense?
There are indeed many possibilities, but the one most characteristic
of formal Keynesian theory would involve the multiplier effect from the
stimulus to effective domestic demand proceeding from a favorable
balance of trade. If this correctly interprets the concept, as I cannot un-
fortunately be sure, an optimum rate of exchange signifies-conforma-
bly to this system of thought-the maximum gain in domestic employ-
ment to be had at the expense of employment in other countries. In
another essay Mrs. Robinson eloquently describes this as a "beggar-my-
neighbor" policy.7 Thus the optimum includes only the citizens of the
favored country and reduces the field of free choice and the maximizing
of want satisfaction in other countries. If such an exchange rate is per-
petuated by authoritarian controls, the policy is clearly a political choice
at the expense of free individual choice for the foreigners. There can be
little doubt-whatever the intent of the author of this theoretical con-
cept-that substantially this course has been actively advocated by
Balogh, Schumacher, and kindred spirits.8
III
I have maintained the thesis that the central economic problem is the
application of scarce means to unlimited wants; that scarcity resolves
itself principally into cost to individuals and the uncovered demand
resolves itself ultimately into the unsatisfied wants of individuals; and
finally, that the basic economic process is thus a weighing of costs to
individuals and of utilities or satisfactions to individuals. These propo-
sitions do not, on the one hand, give results which are merely semantic
or definitional, because they are set together of a straight-forward logi-
cal sequence. On the other hand, the propositions merely distinguish
economic choices from those arrived at on ethical, social, or political
grounds, without prejudice to any of these.
What useful inferences, then, can possibly be drawn from such in-
nocuous analysis? The review of economic or quasi-economic maxima
illustrates one point with what I believe to be sufficient clarity: the ease
with which it is possible to pass by small gradations from economic
maxima reflecting the free choice of individuals in market decisions,
to maxima more or less heavily imbued with political or ethical judg-

---Economics-1950-0-13.txt---
ments, without serving notice upon the intellectual consumer of these
maxima. Because the concepts of maximum or optimum in the economic
literature of the "scientific period" since Adam Smith dealt with free
market decisions, and because economists and the public have become
thoroughly habituated to this connotation, the danger is great that the
newer concepts will be accepted with an unawareness of their ulterior
meanings. Thus Sir William Beveridge's "social priorities" really in-
volve political and authoritarian ethical decisions, though the reader is
not warned of this fact and the "free society" part of the title of his
book9 would rather strongly suggest free individual choice.
The central emphasis of my reasoning, however, has not been put
upon this more or less ideological pitfall but upon real events. The body
of economic analysis has been built up upon the ultimate facts of scar-
city, cost, and the satisfaction of human wants, and cost and utility do
not reveal themselves except in the choices of individual persons. The
larger the group for whom the choice is made vicariously by moral or
political authority, the greater is the probable divergence of these
vicarious choices from what the people would themselves have elected,
which generally goes under the caption of "marginalism" in theoretical
terms.
No society can be operated merely on the basis of free individual
choice in the markets, for there are conspicuous cases, such as monopoly,
cyclical variations, ignorance, perverted tastes, fraud, incapacity to pro-
duce enough for a living, and many more, requiring political interven-
tion. As populations increase and techniques become more involved,
necessary controls seem to become more numerous. And yet this does not
and cannot deny that man, and indeed individual man, remains the
measure of all things: wants are personal and effort is personal. Is it not
profoundly significant that the authors of the outstanding and pioneer-
ing work On the Economic Theory of Socialism, the one, Professor F.
M. Taylor, a staunch liberal, and the other Oscar Lange, a socialist,
have based the entire structure upon consumer free choice of expendi-
ture and producer free choice of occupation? Lange's socialism con-
sisted essentially of state ownership of productive property and of the
enforcement of freedom of consumer and producer choice. With regard
specifically to any "preference scale imposed by bureaucrats," let it be
noted that it was Lange who wrote: "Such a system would scarcely be
tolerated by any civilized people."'1 I would myself prefer to say more
cautiously that if the preference scale is "imposed by bureaucrats,"
economics has long since been silenced. The only type of socialism


---Economics-1950-0-14.txt---
compatible with the economic way of thinking is a socialism based pre-
ponderately upon individual free choice-of consumption, of occupa-
tion, of other matters expressible upon markets.1'
These reflections apply to what is called "economic planning." In the
first place, "planning" falls victim to the same ambiguity which put in
its appearance with the concepts of optimum. Some planning is, and
some is not, compatible with the maximizing of the field of individual
free choice. Some planning signifies the formation of institutions such
as the International Monetary Fund, which was designed-at least
in some notable respects-to restore free-market processes. Planning in
another sense, such as the agricultural price-parity program, is well
calculated to undermine market processes and make the economy sub-
ject solely to political forces. All too often planning of this variety is
defended as "welfare economics," although it negates economics and
ignores the loss of welfare imposed upon the economy as a whole by the
gain of a special segment. It is impossible to oppose "planning" if it
simply means forethought, consistency, and rational provision for con-
tingencies in public policy; but very often the term simply covers the
growth of political decision at the expense of the economic calculus.
A totalitarian state, or a society dominated by power-blocs of labor,
agriculture, and industry cannot give expression to the economic cal-
culus. Economics is necessarily a matter fundamentally of individual
choice and it is thus necessarily also libertarian and individualistic.
Authoritarian societies will gladly bid farewell to the economic way of
thinking. But not only will personal liberty have taken leave, but also
the processes by which the individual secures from his limited resources
the best satisfaction of his individual wants. It would not be the century
of the common man.

The more-than-generous words of introduction by the chairman may
suggest or illustrate the underlying theme of my remarks to follow-
the conflict of values. Needless to say, the value qualities of an intro-
duction lie in the fields of morals and esthetics. No one would think
of applying the category of truth. And as to utility, the "function" of
an introduction seems to be, by a little amiable and gracefully stated
prevarication, to add to the embarrassment of the speaker-if he has
enough modesty or candor in self-appraisal to be subject to embarrass-
ment. I say this, not to return unkindness for kindness, but for the
serious purpose stated, of illustrating what I believe to be a profoundly
important principle in connection with principles; and I wish I had
more time than I shall be able to take, to consider in particular the
conflict between truth and other values, specifically in a liberal ethic
and culture.
Let me add that I am modest and candid enough to be "plenty"
embarrassed already. It is not only my inadequacy to the occasion and
dislike of disappointing an audience such as this. The occasion comes
to me at a time when members of our profession cease, by the usual
official standards, to be useful and are pensioned off-decently and
quietly laid on the shelf. And, standing at this vantage point and sur-
veying the history of our society, of West European civilization and of
the world, during the generation and more in which I, with colleagues
in economics and other branches of what is called social science, have
been diligently "improving" that society and the world, I find little
cause for jubilation or enhancement of self-esteem. And if I turn to


---Economics-1951-0-04.txt---
view the standing of my profession in the world, or that of my special
branch of it, dealing with principles or "theory" in the profession as a
whole, I get no more comfort from what I see. So, I have proposed for
the address which custom demands on this occasion, a bit of general
stock-taking. Such an endeavor is itself reasonably in accord with
custom, if somewhat strange for a "learned society," and I hope it is
a custom not dishonored in the observance. Custom also allows the
speaker, perhaps especially one of the age of this incumbent, to take
a somewhat personal or reminiscent tone, and to verge toward the
character of a sermon rather than that of science or scholarship.
My embarrassment, not only at standing before this audience, but
in all teaching and writing about economic principles, is not new, as
its source is not. I have been increasingly moved to wonder whether
my job is a job or a racket, whether economists, and particularly eco-
nomic theorists, may not be in the position that Cicero, citing Cato,
ascribed to the augurs of Rome-that they should cover their faces
or burst into laughter when they met on the street. Thus, for reasons
which I hope to develop, briefly, my interest has of late tended to shift
from the problems of economic theory, or what seem to be its proper
concerns, to the question of why people so generally, and the learned
elite in particular, as they express themselves in various ways, choose
nonsense instead of sense and shake the dust from their feet at us.
And also, why the theorist is so commonly "in the dog-house" among
economists, as classified by academic faculty lists and books and ar-
ticles in learned journals carrying the word "economic" in their titles.
And I also note that the period of my career as an economist has
been marked by a series of "movements"-I will not say fads-in
economic writing and teaching, consisting largely of attacks on tradi-
tional views of the nature and function of economics, in which the
term "orthodoxy" commonly appears as a "cuss-word," an epithet of
reproach. The critics, aggressors, have more or less explicitly advocated
the abolition of an economics of economic principles and its replace-
ment by almost anything or everything else, other principles if they
can be found-psychological, historical, statistical, political, or ethical,
or no principles at all but factual description of some sector of social-
human phenomena called "economic" for reasons not clear to me. I
cannot comment in detail on these fashions in thinking. The latest
"new economics" and in my opinion rather the worst, for fallacious
doctrine and pernicious consequences, is that launched by the late
John Maynard (Lord) Keynes, who for a decade succeeded in carrying
economic thinking well back to the dark age, but of late this wave of
the future has happily been passing.
This same period of history has also seen a growing disregard for


---Economics-1951-0-05.txt---
free economic institutions in public policy-increasing resort to legis-
lative and bureaucratic interference and control, the growth of pressure
groups employing both political and "direct" action to get what they
want, and with all this the debasement of the state itself, completely
in much of the European world, from free forms to ruthless despotism.
It is surely legitimate to ask whether there is some connection be-
tween the movement of economic thinking and that of political
change.
Now all thinking involves "principles" in some sense, at least the
formation of concepts and fitting of concrete data to concepts through
propositions. Surveying the quality of economic thinking in matters
of policy which seemingly tends to win out, one faces the unpleasant
question whether, if people will not think more or less correctly, it is
good for them to think at all. Perhaps it might be better to go back
to the good old days when men believed and did what they were told
by hoary tradition and constituted authority. For so the great mass
always lived, prior to the advent of our historically unique West
European civilization a couple of centuries ago. Perhaps the "principle"
of authoritarian dictatorship is right after all-or inevitable, which
for practical purposes comes to the same thing-as large groups even
in this country insist and preach. And I do not mean only the Com-
munist Party and its sympathizers; there are others, far more numer-
ous, who are among its most vociferous opponents. For one totalitarian
party will naturally hate another with different leaders and slogans
far worse than they will hate those who stand for freedom.
My doubts and discouragement-for there is no reason to avoid
such words, since I propose here to place truth ahead of other values-
are not new. It has long been my habit to mention to classes the
sinister import of such intellectual phenomena as protectionism in
foreign economnic policy; and the perpetual popular demand for making
capital cheap by manufacturing money; and for creating a demand
for labor by enforcing all sorts of inefficiency, waste and even destruc-
tion. The free-traders, as has been said, win the debates but the pro-
tectionists win the elections; and it makes little difference in our policy
which party wins, the avowed protectionists or the professed free-
traders. Inflation is of course to be brought on as a more pleasant
alternative to taxation, and then suppressed by law and police action.
Try to get people to see that if the value of money has been depreciated
by, say, forty-five per cent, any price, charge, or tax that has not
risen in money terms by over eighty per cent has actually been reduced.
If the rulers of democracy, the demos, will not heed simple arithmetic,
what is the use in talking and writing about problems which really
are problems?--not to mention developing higher mathematical for-

mulas in which the "given" magnitudes must be largely guessed at.
Why engage in public discussion at all, unless one is content with what
seems to be our role to serve as an antidote to the poison being dis-
seminated by other social scientists, even economists? Is it not insulting
one's own intelligence?
The serious fact is that the bulk of the really important things that
economics has to teach are things that people would see for themselves
if they were willing to see. And it is hard to believe in the utility of
trying to teach what men refuse to learn or even seriously listen to.
What point is there in propagating sound economic principles if the
electorate is set to have the country run on the principle that the ob-
jective in trade is to get rid of as much as possible and get as little
as possible in return?, if they will not see that imports are either paid
for by exports, as a method of producing the imported goods more
efficiently, or else are received for nothing?, or if they hold that
economy consists in having as many workers as possible assigned to a
given task instead of the fewest who are able to perform it? Of late,
I have a new and depressing example of popular economic thinking,
in the policy of arbitrary price-fixing. Can there be any use in ex-
plaining, if it is needful to explain, that fixing a price below the free-
market level will create a shortage and one above it a surplus? But the
public oh's and ah's and yips and yaps at the shortage of residential
housing and surpluses of eggs and potatoes as if these things presented
problems-any more than getting one's footgear soiled by deliberately
walking in the mud. And let me observe that rent freezing for example,
occurs not at all merely because tenants have more votes than land-
lords. It reflects a state of mind, a mode of reasoning, even more dis-
couraging than blindness through self-interest-like protectionism
among our Middle-Western farmers.
One must grant that some critics of rationalistic economics seem to
have something, in their contention that theories based on the assump-
tion that men are reasoning beings run contrary to facts. But, from
the standpoint of policy, the question is, will they be more reasonable
in more sweeping political action, considering that it is absurd govern-
mental policies which lead to the criticism in the first place? However,
one notes that protectionism and "featherbedding" of organized work-
ers, and even monetary inflation are not (not often) carried to the
logical point at which all exchange and specialization through ex-
change would stop, or all accumulated resources be eaten up. Explana-
tion of policy might conceivably get farther if we did take a more
psychological tack and instead of reasoning logically, ask why men
believe and practice nonsense but in general act so much less irra-
tionally than they argue-and what follows from that. Presumably


---Economics-1951-0-07.txt---
our lucubrations must have some relation to the public interest if we
are to expect public support; but why they pay us for it anyway is
one of the deep economic mysteries, one might say another striking
example of popular economic irrationality. However, any politician
can always find an "economist" to endorse any position or policy he
sees fit to advocate, and perhaps this is the proper function of our
"'science" in a democracy.
Let me say here that I feel like apologizing for the negativistic and
even complaining tone of my remarks so far-for there is no trans-
gression more unforgivable than refusing to be "optimistic," and
"constructive." But I started out by mentioning the conflict of values
and especially that between truth and other values, and have said that
on this occasion I propose to give a considerable preference to truth
over other standards. It is an advantage of getting old, which I believe
even Cicero overlooked in his great apology for age. A certain inde-
pendence goes with getting to a point where one will hardly be hunting
a job or running for office or (probably) even courting the ladies. One
mnay then indulge in the luxury of a moderate amount of candor, even
of calling a spade a spade. And unpleasant truth-and truth is likely
to be unpleasant, or we should not place so much stress on optimism-
may be useful, up to a point. I would not carry it too far, but occa-
sionally, and in homeopathic doses, as it were. I am reminded of a
deep philosophical observation made by a high politico in a speech
some years ago, here in Chicago I believe, as reported by T. V. Smith:
"The time has come to take the bull by the tail and look the situation
square in the face." It has occurred to me that one of the interesting
"facts of life" is that the expression itself refers to things so ugly or
unpleasant that they are to be kept out of sight or explicit mention.
If time allowed, I should like to follow this out with some "research"
into the reasons why our professional stock in trade is referred to as
"the dismal science." At any rate, I do wish to stress the importance
of negative conclusions, particularly in relation to action, the advisa-
bility of not doing things that will make matters worse, and the fact
that principles of economics do have in a high degree this unromantic
sort of value. And perhaps this applies to knowledge in general. A
humorist once popular in this country stated my favorite "principle"
in education: "It ain't ignorance that -does the most damage, it's
knowin' so derned much that ain't so."
I also spoke earlier of philosophizing, or preaching, in contrast with
more objective discourse. A sermon should have a text; and I have
found a suitable one in the gospel according to "Saint" the Marquis de
Talleyrand-P&erigord: The only good principle is to have no principles
(le seule bon principe est de n'en avoir aucun). Talleyrand, to be sure,


---Economics-1951-0-08.txt---
is not regularly listed among the evangelists. But he was in fact a
bishop in the Church, and another churchman, of the civilized
eighteenth-century French pattern, the abbot Galiani, had earlier
stated the same creed. And anyhow, the saying suits my purpose as a
text. It is, no doubt, usually enjoyed and dismissed as a witty cynicism;
but I propose to treat it quite seriously, as a starting-point. Not lit-
erally, I admit. It is an epigram; and an epigram has been defined as
a half-truth so stated as to be especially annoying to those who believe
in the other half. I wish to stress both halves, the value of principles as
well as their limitations. Accordingly, I must re-word the text into one
of rather the opposite literal import. The right principle is to respect
all the principles, take them fully into account, and then use good
judgment as to how far to follow one or another in the case in hand.
All principles are false, because all are true-in a sense and to a degree;
hence, none is true in a sense and to a degree which would deny to
others a similarly qualified truth. There is always a principle, plausible
and even sound within limits, to justify any possible course of action
and, of course, the opposite one. The truly right course is a matter
of the best compromise, or the best or "least-worst" combination of
good and evil. As in cookery, and in economic theory, it calls for
enough and not too much, far enough and not too far, in any direction.
Moreover, the ingredients of policy are always imponderable, hence
there can be no principle, no formula, for the best compromise. That
laws must be stated in sentences partly accounts for the familiar
"principle," "the law is an ass." And if people don't have good judg-
ment, or won't use it, it is "just too bad," for themselves and for others
over whom they have power.
* * *
After so much by way of "preliminary," I am at last ready for some
consideration of economic principles. These have, or surely ought to
have, two kinds of significance: in explaining what does happen and
in providing guidance for bringing about what is thought desirable or
what "ought" to happen. In the first role they assimilate to principles of
science; in the second, they raise questions of political principle, since
action must be primarily political, and both economic and political
principles are inseparable from ethics. Political principles are of course
affected by the same ambiguity, they both explain and direct, and this
is also true in a sense of the ethical. The problem is complicated by
the tangled relation between the two concerns, explanation and critical
evaluation; for these also are inseparable, yet are finally contradictory.
A complete explanation shows why an event is inevitable, given the
antecedent circumstances; hence it excludes purposive control. Here


---Economics-1951-0-09.txt---
I propose, after a brief reminder of what the main economic principles
are and what they mean, to consider them in the light of three ques-
tions: their value or usefulness, their limitations, and the possible
alternatives-all with respect to explanation and guidance of action.
I need hardly say that all these topics raise the deepest philosophical
issues, and that only a few general and superficial observations, se-
lected rather arbitrarily or at haphazard, are possible here. But let
me note at once that Talleyrand was referring to moral principles in
connection with political action, and it is with respect to these in par-
ticular that I wish to sound an emphatic warning. The most pernicious
and abominable principle of all, though it has been stated and preached
by the highest authorities, ecclesiastical and lay (from Athanasius to
Kant) is the principle of acting on moral principles-"do, right though
the world perish." That is-as will be found to be true of moral
principles generally-it is false and pernicious if it is taken to mean
anything in particular, anything beyond the best compromise, the best
combination of good and bad, and in both means and ends, where the
problem has the means-end form.
Economic principles are simply the more general implications of the
single principle of freedom, individual and social, i.e., free association,
in a certain sphere of activity. The sphere is that of economizing, i.e.,
conduct in which quantitative means are used to achieve quantitative
ends, or rather provisional ends, goods and services quantitatively
comparable as means to a general end, also quantifiable. But economics
deals only with the apportionment of means among the provisional ends
or the proportioning of these, leaving to engineering and kindred
studies the all-or-none choices among technical processes. The general
end has no good and accepted name; it may be called economic well-
being if it is recognized that both terms require definition. It is simply
the common denominator necessarily implied in comparisons between
uses of means. Acceptance of the principle of freedom makes it super-
fluous to define the end, and the less that is specified about it the better.
The provisionally-final ends, as noted, are the impersonal goods and
services desired and sought, produced and consumed, at any time and
place. However, we must not fail to include additional means or re-
sources, produced with some fraction of those in existence at a given
time; maintenance of these, including all replacements, is of course
part of the production of the flow of consumable things.
The free association in question is exchange, in markets, an instru-
mentality necessary to specialized production, and distribution of the
joint result. The meaning of economics in the traditional or orthodox
sense is the analysis of this system of cooperation in the production
and distribution of impersonal goods. "Competition" has no necessary


---Economics-1951-0-10.txt---
or proper place in the organization and its use to describe the free
choice by each of his cooperators is a linguistic accident calamitous for
understanding. All "personal" association, by contrast, involves power,
and personal values are not subject to exchange. The form of purchase
and sale of friendliness or enmity is viewed as immoral, though there is
much pretense both ways-as in most human relations. Exchange or its
terms may be much influenced by personal considerations (really mixed
with giving) and we actually in large measure exchange dinner-parties,
various presents, etc., as well as disfavors. (One reason why a science
of human behavior, in the literal sense, is impossible is that, in con-
trast with physical objects, our behavior is so saturated with varied
make-believe and deception, not clearly separable from the "realities.")
A special and very important form of exchange occurs when one person
places his economic capacity under the direction of another, on terms
fixed by agreement-the principle of "entrepreneurship." Such direc-
tion is a distinctive service in that it cannot be measured until after
the arrangement is liquidated, hence cannot be treated as a means-of-
production or "capitalized" as can be done with other services, includ-
ing the personal type, as far as contracts can be enforced.
The "perfect" market (mis-called perfectly competitive) is unreal
but conceptually necessary. It is the embodiment of complete freedom.
There are no power relations, since everyone has a choice among a
number of equally good alternatives. The freedom in question centers
in the right of each to be the judge of his own values and of the use of
his own means to achieve them. There is no implication of selfishness
or any other judgment of the moral quality or artistic taste reflected in
any want or act. We usually speak of "individual" freedom, but it
applies to any group acting as a unit. The family, "represented" by its
"head," is the usual minimum unit, and there are other units in un-
limited number and variety. Wants and resources are treated simply as
"given" attributes of any individual or other unit; "technology" must
either be included among resources or added as a third given-the
latter the more useful procedure. On the average, an economic subject's
own person, with all its capacities, is the chief means under his control
and is in the majority of cases nearly his only resource. Differences be-
tween personal capacities and external "property" are the creation of
the legal system, and would be absent under a slave economy. The
virtual outlawing of enforcible contracts for personal services creates
a serious disadvantage for one whose resources are in the personal
form; for he cannot freely "realize" future value by sale or pledge
and is consequently dependent on a continuous market as well as
continuity in the capacity itself. But the benefits of freedom are pre-
sumably thought greater than the evil.


---Economics-1951-0-11.txt---
The principle of freedom is apparently accepted in modern civiliza-
tion-consequently called "liberal"-on three or four grounds, which
overlap somewhat. First, and most commonly cited, it is instrumental
to the realization of other ends accepted as rightful. Modern thought
locates value in the individual rather than making him an instrument
to the purposes of the state or its ruler. And it is assumed that the
normal adult person is ordinarily a better judge of his own interests,
values, or well-being, than any agent of society (bureaucrat) given
authority over him is likely to be. Second, freedom itself is a thing
men want, and have a right to, even possibly at the cost of a formally
better management of one's affairs by an overlord of any kind; the
normal person prefers within wide limits to "make his own mistakes."
Third, it is a "value," a thing the individual ought to want, even ought
to have if he may not choose it, a part of the modern ideal of the dignity
of the person. Thus the laws of liberal states do not allow men to sell
themselves (or their children) into "involuntary servitude," even if
they so choose, though everyone is free from day to day to place him-
self or his property under the direction of another, on terms satisfactory
to both parties. This is the entrepreneurial relation, which is in a real
sense the central feature of the modern free economy. Finally, there is
a fourth, "pragmatic" reason, for extending the scope of freedom;
policing is costly to the public authority and coercion itself needs to be
economized.
From the standpoint of explaining actual behavior, one can only
"submit" that people want to economize and that their efforts to make
resources go further are more or less successful; also that correct appor-
tionment of resources among uses is a way of economizing, as are
specialization through exchange of products and the organization of
effort under specialized direction. A large sector of individual and
social behavior is then more or less fully "explained" by these prin-
ciples. How far they go, and what other principles or unsystematic
occurrences may have to be considered, I obviously cannot take up
in detail here.
Certainly economic principles are subject to sweeping limitations as
to their explanatory value. They tell us nothing about concrete eco-
nomic facts, what wants people have, what goods are produced and
exchanged, what resources and techniques are employed, what distribu-
tion takes place. The justification of treating these data in a purely
abstract way is the significance of theory for policy, and I shall come
back to that. Further, it is easy for a critic to "riddle" the principle
of abstract rationality. No one thinks, I hope, that consumers con-
sciously strive to maximize satisfaction, well-being, or whatever it be,
by acting in relation to a known function connecting the state in ques-


---Economics-1951-0-12.txt---
tion with measurable quantities of things available at given prices.
Effort to get the maximum return in money for productive services
seems more realistic, but the view that production is purely in order
to have consumption, unaffected by interests of its own, is clearly
indefensible. Yet comparisons between uses of means are made and
apportionments effected; and the logical principles inherent in these
acts are useful for interpretation even if they do not accurately picture
the conscious motives. It suffices that men largely behave "as if" they
were trying to conform to the principles. These have great value in
the prediction of effects of changes, effects both on and through price
movements, changes that happen or are contrived. And the alternative,
which is statistics on a behavioristic basis, is subject to much the same
limitations, rooted in the vagueness and instability of motives. Cer-
tainly the main effort in statistical economics, the prediction of changes
in business conditions, has not produced results justifying much elation.
More detailed consideration would carry us into the question of the
possibilities and limitations of a natural or positive science of human
conduct. Many limitations are plain to see, and they are related to the
essential fact, which is that such a science is not what we need; indeed,
the idea is an absurdity. For, if even two people predict one another's
behavior and act on their predictions, both predictions will be falsified
and the activities of both parties misdirected. From the standpoint of
explanation alone, motives correspond to forces in mechanics. These
too are unobserved, metaphysical; we read them into the phenomena
for interpretation, because our minds work that way. Forces, however,
are known and measured only by their effects, hence always correspond
exactly with the latter. But we have other information about human
motives, and "know" indisputably that they do not correspond closely
with results, that the connection is affected in all degrees by error of
numerous kinds. Particularly, where motivation takes the form of
using means to achieve ends, either may be more or less "wrong," and
the two errors are only vaguely separable. In this field, knowledge
is so vague and evidence so conflicting that no one can tell with any
accuracy at all, even afterwards, to what degree any action is really
economic. Still further, we know that the goods and services produced,
traded, and consumed do not correspond to final or real wants. These
are largely not individual, as the theory requires, but inhere in social
relations, such as "keeping up with the Joneses," and "getting ahead
of the Joneses"; or, they are symbolic, even deliberately "set up," as
in play, to make action interesting and yield the feeling of success or
victory-thus reversing the means-end relation assumed in economics.
Or, the motive is no particular result but mere gratification of curiosity


---Economics-1951-0-13.txt---
as to what the result will be. And all these symbolic relations are ex-
tremely unstable and change unpredictably.
Since a fetish of "scientific method" in the study of society is one
of the two most pernicious forms of romantic folly that are current
among the educated, this theme ought to be developed at a length
which is impossible here. (The other "folly," which will receive more
attention presently, as my main theme, is the idea that devotion to
moral principles offers the solution of social problems.) "Science," in
the meaning of the natural sciences, can of course do something toward
both explaining and directing social events; and nothing is further
from my purpose here than any belittling of the importance of ethics.
What I insist upon is an understanding of the meaning and limitations
of simple or statable principles in both areas. In the naive form in
which both doctrines, scientism and moralism, are usually preached,
both are antithetical to the principle or ideal of freedom; they imply,
and if taken seriously would lead to, absolute authoritarianism. The
notion that evils are due to sin works out, as European history makes
clear, in having the right people (as shown by their being in power)
enforce their orthodoxy on all by burning or otherwise liquidating the
heretics, schismatics, and infidels, as occasion demands, though mainly
by effective indoctrination and conditioning for submissiveness before
the age of responsibility. The principle has merely been taken over
by the Marxists from historical ecclesiastical Christianity, with un-
important changes in moral or political content, though with sweeping
but practically irrelevant change in the professed underlying meta-
physic. As to a "science" of human conduct, I have mentioned some
difficulties, notably that one of the most distinctive traits of man is
make-believe, hypocrisy, concealment, dissimulation, deception. He is
the clothes-wearing animal, but the false exterior he gives to his body
is nothing to that put on by his mind. My evangelist, Talleyrand, also
remarked that speech is the medium by which men disguise their
thoughts. The "real wants" or wishes, referred to before, run largely
in pairs of opposites; besides conformity and distinction we find
familiarity and novelty or fixity and change, adventure and security,
and so on. Mostly they have no specific content and anything that
happens or is done will fit one or the other of some pair. Such prin-
ciples cannot explain any concrete occurrence, the obvious weakness
of the "instincts" that were the groundwork of a "psychology" very
popular some years ago.
Another obstreperous feature of human phenomena is that men
have "attitudes" toward law as such, both descriptive and imperative
law, and both positive and negative attitudes. If there is a law, either


---Economics-1951-0-14.txt---
a uniformity or a command and someone finds it and publishes it, one
of the first results is a general impulse to violate it. Man is a "contrary
critter"-in contrast with the conformism of physical nature. And on
the other hand, men love to make laws for their own sake, to conform
for a while, until tired of it, then break them and make new ones.
Much of the apparent uniformity of behavior is such ritual. And there
may be substantive reasons for non-conformity, or for temporary con-
formity that ultimately causes disruption of the pattern. A familiar
example is boom and depression in various prices and in general prices
-the purchasing power of money. An accepted prediction of change
will cause the change predicted, for a time, then an inevitable re-
versal. It is true that many generalizations can be made about men
and about all known societies. Professor Murdock has listed some
dozens of them. But they are of a general, abstract type. All men
have a language-but what language? and what will they say in it
or with it? And so with numerous institutions. Every society has a
technology which "works" up to a point, keeps people alive; but in
spite of the conformity of the physical world to uniform natural laws,
the fact tells us virtually nothing significant as to what to expect in
the way of concrete "economic" behavior, corresponding to the predic-
tion of planetary orbits, eclipses, etc., or the outcome of physical opera-
tions. (But if a physical operation is experimental, problem-solving,
prediction of the result or the course of the operation itself is a self-
contradiction.) All peoples and most individuals have some religion.
But the careful student, Professor Lowie, finds it impossible to, give
a general definition of the word, and the dictionary definitions, vague
as they are, do not cover actual usage. The simple fact is that we
commonly recognize and describe human behavior forms as expres-
sions of some feeling, intent, belief, not as bare acts. And our terms
often contain an inseparable value-judgment as well; there is no specific
intent, not to mention a specific act, of murder or theft.

All this about the abstract and interpretive character of economic
theory or principles has little to do with their significance. That is be-
cause their main value is connected with policy determination, under
the fundamental ethical principle of freedom. Assuming that men have
a right to want and strive to get whatever they do want, and to have
the tastes and "higher" values they do have, as long as their conduct
does not infringe the equal rights of others, the business of the eco-
nomics of principles, of utility, productivity, and price, is to explain
that, and how, the organization through buying-and-selling enables
everyone to do whatever he tries to do (whether rational or not, as
judged by anyone else) many times more effectively than would be pos-


---Economics-1951-0-15.txt---
sible if each used his own means in a self-sufficient economic life.
Everyone is free, as a Crusoe is free, and also enjoys the nearly bound-
less gain in the effectiveness of action possible through organization. In
fact, the individual's range of choice is extended in a new dimension
beyond that of Crusoe; he can produce anything he pleases, or make
any specific contribution to production, and independently consume
anything or any combination produced by anyone anywhere in the
economy. No other possible method of organization will afford this
two-fold freedom. And anyone is also free to stay out of the system
and live his own self-sufficient life, as far as he cares to stand the
loss in efficiency-which usually in fact would rapidly become too
great to be borne. And all are free to give and receive goods or counsel,
and to cooperate on any terms other than those set by the market which
they, the parties concerned, may agree in preferring on moral grounds
or for any reason. Distribution, what the individual (family unit) gets
out of it all, is also in principle the same as with a Crusoe; it is what
he produCes. That is, what he--the productive "capacity" he furnishes
-adds to total output, which is the only meaning the product of a unit
can have when production is a joint activity. In fact, the "imputation"
process under market-competition is valid in the sense in which any
single causes produce an effect where causes act jointly, as they always
do. It is the diference caused by the single contribution, as isolated by
the mathematical operation of partial differentiation. (Consumption
is usually treated, not very accurately, as unorganized.)
Stating all this at length makes me feel that I ought to apologize
to you, and to myself; for it is really at the level of truism and trivi-
ality. Of course there are "assumptions": that free association implies
mutual advantage and that freely chosen advantage to individuals is
"good," in contrast with obedience or ascetic self-denial or self-torture
(as men professed to believe even in Europe only a few centuries ago).
It is assumed that in general normal adults are rational enough to be
trusted to manage their own affairs, and decent enough to allow others
to do the same; but this means only in comparison with the dictates
of some human authority, political or ecclesiastical, chosen in what-
ever way, who might be in a position to order them around. The ethic
of liberal civilization holds (I repeat) both that men want to be free
and have a right to be, and they ought to be free, even if they them-
selves feel that their affairs might possibly be technically better man-
aged for them as slaves by some possible master. Of course even these
assumptions in an extreme version are made only for the purposes of
theory; everyone admits that in practice governments have to set some
limits to individual freedom and freedom of association and to perform
many functions on behalf of the community as a whole. If only eco-


---Economics-1951-0-16.txt---
nomics could really teach people the simple and obvious fact, which
most of them already know but refuse to accept, that anyone producing
for exchange is producing for himself, as much as a Crusoe, but merely
a thousand times more effectively because he does it indirectly by pro-
ducing for the needs of others. If this were realized, it would surely put
an end to all the insane or diabolical revolutionary propaganda and
most of the stupid criticisms of the "capitalist system" that menace our
free institutions. Why it is necessary to teach this, and accordingly so
hard, if not useless to try, is the major real social problem. I can give it
little consideration here. But I must note an apparent "innate disposi-
tion" in men to think that somebody is getting the better of them, that
they are working for somebody else, even where it is, if possible, more
absurd than the idea of the wage-worker that he is working to make
profits for some greedy capitalist. Doesn't the student regularly talk
about working for his professor, and even the patient aver that he
is coerced by his doctor, whom he hires and fires and even defies, at
will-except for the natural consequences? The much-abused "profit-
system" is of course merely a pattern of cooperation, on the terms most
satisfactory to the parties concerned, or the only terms they can agree
upon. "Property" has intrinsically nothing to do with it; it may be and
is the same where only labor services are involved at all.
I wish I had time to follow up in particular the relation between
doctor and patient. The similarities and differences as compared with,
say, the relationships of an industrial corporation, should be interesting,
even instructive. Two or three obvious facts which need emphasis must
be barely mentioned. The doctor in whose hands one places oneself
as a "case" will inevitably have much power, variously and precari-
ously limited by moral, legal, and other restrictions and compulsions.
The only real freedom the patient can have is the right and opportunity
to choose and change at will his doctor. And the significance of this is
limited, since in the nature of things the patient cannot act very in-
telligently in the matter. He would himself have to possess the spe-
cialized knowledge of the medical profession, and much more, in
order to appraise it in others. But the case of individual patient and
individual doctor (or other professional counselor) is simple in com-
parison with the problem presented by the vast and highly organized
productive units required for the exploitation of modern technology.
Here centralized direction is imperative anyway, apart from specialized
competence in the directive function. Hence the final word of the
candid economist to the public must be-don't expect too much, in
the way of freedom, or justice, along with the immeasurable increase
in technical efficiency that results from these two facts of modern
civilization, special competence, and centralized direction. In particu-


---Economics-1951-0-17.txt---
lar, don't expect too much of "tlle state"; be very critical in appraising
the prospects for good and for harm to result before calling on
"Leviathan" and giving him power. In the scope of this address, this,
the most vital conclusion, must be stated rather than argued; but it
remains true that the chief reliance of the "employee" must be free-
dom of choice among employers, unsatisfactory though it is, as in the
case of the patient and the doctors.
Given the principle of freedom, as active freedom of association, the
notion of scientific control of society is a palpable contradiction. (It
applies in varying degree in the treatment of defectives, young chil-
dren, and criminals.) For a dictator, the problem would be formally
parallel to that of scientific technology; but even in that case, the con-
tent of control would be utterly different. For, unless he could completely
drug or hypnotize and so eliminate the minds and wills of his subject-
slaves, the autocrat-proprietor of a society would have to rule throughi
those minds and wills. Hence the operation would employ such tech-
niques as persuasion or coercion, suggestion, cajolery, flattery, and,
above all, deception-which is at the heart of what is called "force"
in human relations-and also, inevitably, some real discussion. But
these things have no meaning for the relations between purposive
human beings and the inert objects of nature where scientific technique
is literally applicable. (The higher animals, notably in domestication,
present an intermediate situation which must here be ignored.) In a
democracy, the notion of control is not merely unethical, it is excluded,
ipso facto. The self-contradiction of a number of persons mutually pre-
dicting one another's behavior and acting on their predictions has
already been pointed out, and that of mutual control is even more ob-
viously absurd. The problem of democracy is to establish a consensus,
by genuine discussion, with intellectual appeal to super-individual
norms. Mere expression of individual desires is not discussion and can
only exacerbate conflict of interests and intensify the problem, not tend
toward solution in all-around agreement. Objective norms belong to a
third level of reality, distinct from and above individual desire or end-
and-means, as the category of the instrumental is different from and
"above" mechanical sequence or cause-and-effect. And judgments about
norms and ideals are affected by a different category of error, though
the facts, that norms are objects of desire, and that means-and-end
parallels cause-and-effect make clear analysis impossible.
Genuine "free" discussion is a difficult thing to deal with con-
ceptually, and more difficult to realize in practice. The problem pre-
sents two aspects: first, agreement on the range in which agreement
itself is considered necessary, as marked off from individual freedom
and diversity, and second, the specific content of uniformity in its


---Economics-1951-0-18.txt---
sector. On any considerable scale, discussion itself must be organized;
and this organization presents practically the same problems as the
matter to be dealt with, specifically the limitation of freedom by rules
and authority in order to secure the greatest possible freedom and the
performance of function.
The supreme and inestimable merit of the exchange mechanism is
that it enables a vast number of people to cooperate in the use of
means to achieve ends as far as their interests are mutual, without
arguing or in any way agreeing about either the ends or the methods
of achieving them. It is the "obvious and simple system of natural
liberty." The principle of freedom, where it is applicable, takes other
values out of the field of social action. In contrast, agreement on terms
of cooperation through discussion is hard and always threatens to be-
come impossible, even to degenerate into a fight, not merely the failure
of cooperation and loss of its advantages. The only agreement called for
in market relations is acceptance of the one essentially negative ethical
principle, that the units are not to prey upon one another through
coercion or fraud.
This picture of the open-market, free-enterprise organization must
sound very one-sided, and it is one-sided. Presumably, no competent
mind has ever believed in it exclusively. If there have been real
anarchists, they were not economists. And the society pictured by the
pure, idealized theory of the market economy is, or would be, one held
together by the single moral principle just stated. This is entirely
proper as a postulate for theoretical analysis at a certain stage of ab-
straction. But the idea that freedom, or any single principle, contains
the solution, or the best solution, of social problems, is of course un-
realistic, and is directly contrary to the thesis of this paper, as stated at
the outset. Exaggeration of the significance of freedom, or over-
emphasis, to the neglect of other principles, was the great error of the
liberal age, and is partly responsible for the reaction we now witness,
which threatens extinction of freedom and of all defensible values. It
should go without saying that freedom alone would not produce an
approximation to the conditions required for a market itself, the freest
possible market. And modern economists have not thought otherwise.
The accusation that Adam Smith, for example, believed in a universal
harmony of interests among men, is merely one discouraging example
of what passes widely in learned circles for history and discussion.
At a minimum, rules must be made and enforced by some agency repre-
senting the whole market collectively; and the policing must be paid
for on a principle other than direct individual payment for service
received. And at most, as I have emphasized, the market deals only in
impersonal values. To realize its ideal character, the system would


---Economics-1951-0-19.txt---
have to be operated through vending machines, avoiding personal con-
tact between the parties to exchange. At this point, I turn to more
detailed, though brief and inadequate, notice of the limitations of free-
dom, from the standpoint of policy, or of freedom as a policy. This
will be followed by an even briefer glance at the alternatives and the
final practical problem, making up the classical three parts of the
argument.
There is a paradox about the general problem of economic organiza-
tion. One can state a case which sounds much like an "air-tight" justi-
fication of market freedom or laissez-faire. But if it is easy to "riddle"
the notion of means-end rationality as an explanatory principle, this
is still more true of the apologetic for reliance on the free market as
an ideal social policy. We also encounter a logical paradox in the con-
cept of freedom. On one hand, it is not discussable, being the pre-
supposition of discussion, and freedom in conduct is inseparable from
that in communication. Yet we are brought up short by a glance at
our own history. For it is only in the small island of our own modern
(post-Enlightenment) West European culture that the axiom is ac-
cepted; in history as a whole, including rather especially European
history in the preceding epochs, political or economic liberty, and even
more, religious-moral-intellectual freedom, was emphatically rejected,
on principle, if it was ever contemplated as a possibility. The aristo-
cratic, slave-holding town-republics of ancient times hardly call for
mention as exceptions. Though we can learn from their experience and
discussion because some problems of democracy arise within any rul-
ing class (unless it is an established hierarchy headed by an absolute
authority like Hitler, the Pope or Stalin, with effective provision for
the succession). The rise of the strange phenomenon of modern liberal-
ism is undoubtedly to be explained in part as a reaction against the
peculiar dogmatism, intolerance, and obscurantism of medieval "Chris-
tian" Europe. But much of the former spirit is with us yet; and the
superposition of an ethic of extreme freedom and individual rights on
an extreme authoritarianism of obedience and duties based on status,
is surely a chief source of the moral-intellectual confusion of our age,
of which we hear so much (and so much nonsense). And a kind of
pendular principle in history no doubt helps to account for the new
turnabout which has carried so much of the world back to despotism.
My own view of the social-economic policy is not greatly concerned
with the notion of treating the individual satisfaction-function as a
welfare-function and proceeding to the notion of a social maximum in
terms of some relation between individual maxima. It is too clearly
indefensible to treat "happiness" or the "good life" for the individual
as a definable end to be achieved by a definite technique; and even


---Economics-1951-0-20.txt---
more indefensible to view the objective of social-economic policy in
terms of the amount and distribution of measurable impersonal goods
and services. Wealth and poverty are terribly important things, but
that view of their significance seems to me an absurd over-simplifica-
tion. Freedom itself, as a value per se, is far more important. In "eco-
nomic" life, in the ordinary empirical reference, the motivation of
competitive sport plays a role at least as great as the endeavor to
secure gratifications mechanically dependent on quantitative consump-
tion. Some business efficiency expert is said to have advised reforming
football by having all the men play on the same side, instead of half
pushing against the other half. The real problem centers, of course, in
the fact that activity has both characters; it is a game, but one in which
the most vital substantive goods, comfort and life itself, are stakes,
inseparably combined with victory and defeat and their bauble-
symbols. The social problem is to make the best possible rules for this
complex and paradoxical game, which everyone is compelled to play.
And it must go on almost without interruption, and it is impossible to
play a game and discuss the rules at the same time. The intellectual
problem involved in rule-making is different in kind from that of play
itself, and neither-it is important to note-has much relation to
scientific technology, or means-end rationality; nor to our traditional
religious-ethical principle of charity. For, when charity comes into a
game, the game goes out; though in relation to the other aspect of the
process, the production and distribution of goods considered intrinsically
useful, it does have a part to play. I may suggest that the ethic really
believed in and reasonably practiced by the modern man centers in
sportsmanship, and the related principle of workmanship.
Even with much and costly social action, there can be no very close
approximation to the theoretical perfect market, particularly in one
important area, the labor market. This fact does not at all justify most
of the action being taken in that field, by unions or by government; in
general, the argument against price control and other interference is
made stronger, not weaker, by the "imperfect competition" which is
used as a defense for it. And the action we see is designed to make the
market still more imperfect, and to benefit a select stratum already
comparatively well off, at the expense of their weaker brethren. The
effects cannot be traced and measured in detail, but it is a safe "princi-
ple" that in a power contest the weakest get the worst of it. The chief
"mechanical" defects in the market system arise less out of "frictions"
than out of speculative situations. When in order to act rationally each
must first know or guess at what everyone else will do, the result is
complicated cyclical tendencies; in particular, speculation in the future
value of money gives rise to "the business cycle," sometimes an actual


---Economics-1951-0-21.txt---
social disaster. Monopoly is another evil, though the public miscon-
ceives its nature and grossly exaggerates the extent and power of busi-
ness monopolies. A majority of producers and dealers have some
short-run monopoly position; but in general, monopoly is temporary
and functional, on the same principle as patent-rights. Protective duties
foster monopoly; but where monopoly really bites is in the legal
brigandage of organized wage-earners and farmers. The business inter-
est itself is far more dangerous to free society through political action
as a pressure group; but it stands no chance in competition with voting
masses "agitated" and organized for power and plunder-all the worse
for their self-righteous motivation. Obviously, anything like nation-wide
collective bargaining and striking is coercion of the country, not of
any opposed economic interest; and as noted, the heaviest cost falls
on other "workers," especially those still weaker. (Perhaps I should
use a more polite word; but I said I would exploit the privilege of age
to put truth ahead of manners; and what does anyone, including the
"honest brigand" want but his "rights," to be judge of his own case
and have coercive power to enforce his own verdict?)
Far more important than all the mechanical imperfections of "market
competition" (the real ones, not created by stupid or unwise public
action) are limitations of the principle of economic freedom inherent
in unalterable conditions of life and associative action. Our economic
ills are not due to the failure of competition; on the contrary, the result
of perfect functioning of the system would be socially quite intolerable.
The free market, with reasonable help from state authority, can make
tolerable provision for the economic cooperation of individuals and
other "units," as far as it is "cooperation," as far as their interests
are mutual. By the same argument it can not solve any other problems,
and there are many other and grave problems that insistently call for
solution. So in other fields: free association will solve the problems "up
to a point," but not completely or by itself. Social problems are not
only hard but finally insoluble. Yet many of them will inevitably get
some kind of "treatment"; it is a question of better or worse, or of
making things better, more or less, or making them worse than before,
even to downright disaster. As I remember hearing "Tommy" Adams
say in a classroom, we must not call any problems insoluble which must
be solved in some way and for which some solutions are better, or
worse, than others.
The most serious limitations of the free-market economy, and major
problems set by it, arise from the fact that it takes the "units," indi-
viduals, families, etc., as "given," which is entirely unrealistic. In the
economic aspect specifically, it "assumes" given "wants, resources and
technique," in possession of each and all. The market is an agency of


---Economics-1951-0-22.txt---
cooperation between such given units; it is no agency for improving
tastes (wants) or manners or especially for conferring productive
capacity to meet wants or needs; it will not redistribute capacity and
hence product, to accord better than the realities do with any norm of
ideal justice. Business relations clearly do work to dissolve clannishness
and dogmatic allegiances, and to promote tolerance, and a degree of
generosity. But in the distribution of economic resources atomistic
motivation tends powerfully toward cumulatively increasing inequality.
For all productive capacity-whether owned "property" or personal
qualities-is essentially "capital," a joint creation of pre-existing ca-
pacity (or the result of "accident"). And those who already have more
capacity are always in a better position to acquire still more, with the
same effort and sacrifice. This applies about as much to personal
capacity as to property, though the latter is a more convenient way
of passing on "unearned" advantage to heirs or successors. It is a gross
injustice-by one of several conflicting norms of justice generally
accepted in liberal society. But it is also the main reliance for the
motivation of accumulation in all forms, hence of progress, all forms
of which are directly or indirectly dependent on means and their eco-
nomical use. And the tendency goes on beyond the individual life,
from generation to generation, through the family and transmission of
advantages. It is modified but hardly mitigated, and certainly not
simplified, by the large element of "luck" in human affairs. Any serious
effort to interfere with the process would weaken the family in other
connections, and if it were replaced by some other primary group, the
anti-equalitarian tendency might still be as strong.
No doubt we all agree that extremes of wealth and poverty are un-
just, especially when they do not correspond with personal effort or
sacrifice-and are bad in other ways. The question is, what can we
do about it? Can the rules of the economic game be so changed that
the winnings, symbolic and real (and the former are not much inferior
in importance) will accord better with some accepted or defensible
criterion of justice? And can it be done without wrecking the game
itself, as a game, and as a producer of the fruits on which we all live?
The intricate conflict of values here cannot be spelled out in detail-
freedom with order, efficiency and progress, interesting activity, but
especially freedom versus justice. The ancient provision against misery
was to stress as sacred the obligations of family and neighborhood, and
"charity," alms-giving, by those having an excess over "needs." But in
the main, men were told and conditioned to believe that somehow
everything is really for the best, and the evils of life have to be borne


---Economics-1951-0-23.txt---
-patience and fortitude. Almsgiving tended to mean supporting the
clergy and endowing religious foundations, while an uncertain fraction
went to relieve poverty (real or feigned) and that did an uncertain
amount of good-certainly made little impression on poverty as a
whole. Modern society has largely shifted the load of relief from the
family and local group, which can no longer so well bear it, or be made
to, and centralized it more and more on the national government
through progressive income and inheritance taxation. A vast improve-
ment has come about, chiefly through assuring to poor children sup-
port and some equipment for earning a livelihood, with family limita-
tion offsetting improved sanitation and medical care. This of course
does not meet either ideal requirements or the popular demand-per-
haps even social necessity considering, again, the children, now future
citizen-voters as well as producers of more children, and soldiers. But
specialists seem to agree that taxation, for peace uses, can be pushed
further very gradually at best, if the practical limit has not already
been approached, at least for a government that is not to employ powers
incompatible with basic freedoms. So what? I have no answer to that
one, especially for the crucial matter of how far society can allow
free production of children and agree to support them "decently" and
of necessity their parents along with them. But the classes that pro-
duce babies can outvote those that prefer "substance and culture" to
large families, particularly if the latter are soft-hearted and encourage
them to demand "justice." Moreover, the prolific can muster the larger
armies, and perhaps the tougher too, where the distinction conforms to
national areas; and it is here the conflict between freedom and equali-
tarian justice now is the great world menace.
With no pretense that my message is a cheering one, I can only, in
the interest of what seems to me plain truth, go on to emphasize the
difficulties of our problems and the danger of action that will make
things worse instead of better. As is now evident, the "liberal" nine-
teenth century, following the rationalistic eighteenth, was wrong in its
view that mere individual liberty, religious-intellectual, political and
economic, would yield well-being and happiness. It did indeed accom-
plish wonders, supplemented by the kind of state action accepted by its
original advocates. And people seem much more actively dissatisfied
than before. J. S. Mill's Political Economy and Marx-Engels' Com-
munist Manifesto appeared almost simultaneously in the middle of the
"wonderful century," wonderful especially for the common man. But
Mill was very critical of the institution of property; and the Manifesto
called on the workers of the world to unite for the violent overthrow
of all pre-existing social order, because "you have nothing to lose but
your chains." Madness, criminal madness, of course; but how many of


---Economics-1951-0-24.txt---
the bright and educated have fallen for and preacned it, in democratic
countries where the masses are well off beyond historical comparison!
And it has become the accepted political creed in the largest nations of
the Old World, who now thlreaten us so dangerously with "liberation"
in accord with its tenets. Is it human nature to be more dissatisfied the
better off one is? I shall not venture an answer to that one, either.
All I can do is to indicate the nature of the problem of free society,
as I see it, point out some false leads and some things that "have to
be," "or else." I do not predict; it may be a case like Uncle Remus's
rabbit that was "bleeged to climb a tree," to get away from a dog. If
free society is to exist, the electorate must be informed, and must have
and use economic and political intelligence and, of course, possess the
moral qualities actually needful. On the intelligence factor I cannot
take time to say more. I hope I have said enough to show that the
problem is not of the kind so successfully attacked by natural science
and technology in the interest of control by man over the natural en-
vironment. It must be "social" intelligence, of the general sort exempli-
fied in the discussion by a group of the problem of improving a game
-but with complications due to the vast scale of national and world
society and the complex of conflicting interests and ideals involved. For
help as to intelligence, we now instinctively turn to institutional edu-
cation. This can certainly impart information, up to varying individual
limits, and schools have also been successful enough in increasing
knowledge-some say too successful -and the somewhat opposed
functions of transmission and revision might perhaps be better co-
ordinated. But does education make people intelligent? As to certain
"intellectual skills," no doubt it does, again up to varying limits. But
as to good sense, the "gumption" required to select and reject between
sound measures and crude economic nostrums, such as I mentioned
at the outset, the arbitrary interference with freedom of trade, fixing
prices by fiat, and preaching revolution, the evidence is not encourag-
ing. The "smart" and the educated seem to fall for these as readily as
the man--in-the-street. Indeed it often appears that the result of costly
training is to make people more ingenious in thinking up and defend-
ing indefensible theories. The crackpots of all kinds and degrees are not
recruited from the dumbbell or ignoramus classes. Even outside the
"moral sciences," it is not these who spend their lives squaring the
circle and inventing perpetual-motion machines.
What schools can do on the side of moral qualities is another ques-
tion. But first let me say here what I have long believed, that the crucial
problem in our whole intellectual-spiritual life, our culture, is the rela-
tions between the great values, perhaps especially truth and goodness
or knowledge and virtue. I have time only for these and to note the


---Economics-1951-0-25.txt---
relative neglect of the third member of the trio, beauty and taste-
taste that is good or bad, in contrast with "mere" taste-and the even
more neglected role of play or fun, entirely left out of the good life
in our Hebrew-Puritan tradition. You will recall that Socrates-Plato
thought that virtue is knowledge (meaning reasoned knowledge, like
mathematics, not science) in opposition to the Christian (Pauline)
view, that we know the good but choose the evil. (But Aristotle at least
partly disagreed with Plato, and a famous saying of Ovid sides with
Paul.) My point is that I see the main task of education in our age as
training to separate believing and believing-in from liking for other
reasons, at the crudest level, to distinguish sound from sense and in
general, truth from esthetic or moral or any "romantic" attraction. In
any case, indoctrination is a vicious trap, and a liberal must wish it were
impossible. The first test of a free society is that it teach its youth to
question and criticize and form opinions only by weighing evidence-
and to admit ignorance where there is no evidence-instead of implant-
ing eternal and immutable truth, with abject submission to the inevita-
ble authoritative interpreter, by some prescriptive right. And on the
other side, it is an equally pernicious idea that by education a society
can lift itself by its bootstraps. Who is to educate the educators? Only
some absolute authority, manifestly. And control of education is the first
aim of the totalitarian. His ideal is a priesthood as the custodians of
Truth, "conditioning" each generation in helpless infancy to unques-
tioning belief, and to go through life like little children.
One of the hardest lessons which in my opinion our democracy has
to learn is to make necessary reservations about much of our ethical
tradition, propagated under religious or church auspices. It should
be superfluous to point out that this is an inheritance from an age when
virtue in the common man was thought by everyone to consist precisely
in the acceptance and submission I just spoke of-conformity to a
sacred law and obedience to consecrated authority, Holy Mother
Church and Holy Father King. What our Sunday-school moral adages
mean is simply the command to be good children and mind Momma
and Poppa. They sound well, and their sentiment has a place; but if
we ask what they mean, from the standpoint of democratic citizenship,
they are simply irrelevant. When they were proclaimed, the idea that
the ordinary man (not to mention the woman) should make and un-
make the laws and literally hire and fire the rulers, would have pro-
voked only loathing and terror, if it had been dreamed of as a possibility.
Even the "Golden Rule," to treat others as you would be treated, is also
an epigram. First, it should of course be as the other himself would
be treated, or as "you" would be in his place, and with him in yours.
But for the slave master, what the slave would want would be to change


---Economics-1951-0-26.txt---
places: "let me be master and you be slave"-which would be no im-
provement in the system. But such is the romantic view of God: one
who puts down the mighty from their seats and exalts the lowly, who
fills the poor with good things, but the rich he sends empty away. Well,
turn about may be fair play, but again we get no light on how to im-
prove the social order. Taking slavery or any institutional framework
as given, humane behavior is laudable. And that is exactly what our
religious ethic did, and does; it takes the established order of things
as given, in fact as divinely ordained: "Let every soul be subject unto
the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that
be are ordained of God" (Romans, 13:1). And of course this explicitly
included subservience of wives to their husbands. The only exception
recorded is the right of the propagandist of the "true faith" to preach,
in defiance of the authorities (Acts 5:29).
Again, as always (in accord with my theme) there is another side.
Liberalism can be equally naive and as given to empty words. No adult
in his right mind ever believed that men are born free and equal-
except for that complete and in that sense equal helplessness, for which
freedom is without meaning. The socialists and communists have called
religion the opiate of the masses, and in a broad historical sense that is
correct. But two other truths have not been so clear to either side in
the controversy. First; some pacifier, reconciler or escape was necessary
in a society that accepted the "static" philosophy of life that actually
was accepted everywhere prior to the "awakening" in Western Europe
in the 17th and 18th centuries. Then were born the ideas of freedom
and of progress in and through knowledge and intelligent action under
free cooperative association. For man is a romantic animal; and
until a people is prepared to make changes by intelligent agreement,
supernatural sanctions are required to make them accept what is estab-
lished and not criticize or try to change it. The second fact is that-
disregarding the question of how much intellectual maturity West-
European peoples had attained by the age of the Enlightenment-it is
certain on general grounds that the basic framework of social order
must always be accepted custom, interpreted and applied by agents
having a large amount of power. The possible amount and speed of
free and intelligent social change will always be quite narrowly limited.
This is particularly true if intelligent change is taken to mean change
in the direction of the ideals of justice and freedom, justice implying
some kind of fundamental equality-and other values generally ac-
cepted in our modern liberal world-view. As I would like to show at
greater length than is possible here, no close approach to realization of
those ideals is within the realm of possibility. Consequently, men will
always require, as a condition for maintaining any high civilization at


---Economics-1951-0-27.txt---
all, some "opiate," or some effective agent to prevent their demanding
their rights. The only alternative to belief in supernatural sanctions of
an existing system quite far from just is that intelligence shall be
fully aware of its own narrow limitations and be supplemented by a
high order of tolerance, and self-sacrifice, the patient acceptance of the
best all-round choice among evils. Especially, as the world is built,
the chances of loss are overwhelmingly greater than the chances of
gain in any effort to escape the ills we have by flying to others that we
know not of. Since order is the absolute requisite of civilized life, we
must stick to the order that is, until there is a reasonable agreement on
changes that will be on balance beneficial.
The balance will always be hard to strike and entirely a matter of
judgment, not of formula, a balance between principles that conflict,
while each claims to be absolute. The danger now, in the world and in
the West, is that freedom will be thrown away, for a promise or hope
of justice, but with an actual result of neither justice nor freedom, and
very likely the suicide of civilization in war without rules. The world
could be heading toward a new age of essentially religious wars,
ideological wars. Historically this would be nothing new, except for its
scale and for the destructiveness of modern military technology. Other-
wise, Europe is reverting to form. For as I have said, Communism, in
its social program or pretensions, is largely a revival of historical-
ecclesiastical Christianity, with the church more effectively merged
in one all-powerful state. From the downfall of the Roman imperium to
the age of liberalism, Europe lived under one or more dogmatic, in-
tolerant, persecuting and violently proselyting religions-claiming pos-
session of the formula for salvation they could not be or do otherwise
-and much of the time in a state of war between two or more such
religions. In Christianity, surely, we find the supreme "irony of his-
tory": that an original teaching centered ethically in humility, meek-
ness, self-denial, and self-sacrifice became organized into corporations
whose dignitaries have hardly been matched for arrogant grasping,
using, and flaunting of power and wealth and for insistence on pre-
rogative to the borderline of worship. One turns to Dostoievsky's
famous speech of the Grand Inquisitor, for any adequate portrayal of
this situation and its sinister indications of the nature of human nature.
The plea of Communism, like that of Christianity, is justice, under
absolute authority, ignoring freedom. (The former does extol progress,
and progress through science, both of which Christianity despised; by
the same argument, Communism is, overtly less devoted to law and tra-
dition, more openly claims the right to ignore or break the law.) For
Liberalism, the primary value is freedom, self-limited by laws made by
the community, ideally by general assent, in practice by representatives


---Economics-1951-0-28.txt---
elected by a voting majority-one of its dangers. The laws of a liberal
state will also be general, non-specific, but in a sense quite different
from the Golden Rule or Law of Universal Love. The familiar figure is
rules of the road, in contrast with instructions where and when and
how to travel, whether arbitrary or conformable to a traditional prac-
tice. But such freedom must be sweepingly limited by measures not
only of a "police" character in a broad sense, but also designed to
equip the individual and family for social life by implanting wants and
tastes in general conformity with the culture, and endowing with a
minimum of productive capacity (or ultimately with final goods) with-
out which freedom is a form empty of content. To take these units as
"given" is flagrantly contrary to essential facts-of-life, and means
ignoring the major social problem. It is along this line that 18th-19th
century liberalism went to an extreme that has provoked a reaction
which threatens to engulf all freedom, and justice too, in the modern
conception of it, if not to destroy civilization. Liberal states have been
engaged, however, through their short life, in correcting this imbalance
between freedom and justice; and more intelligence, better judgment,
is our need, rather than any radical departure in method.
The prime requisite is simply critical intelligence. And it may well
appear as if the race at large hates this type of effort, naturally, in-
stinctively. Anyhow, we have been conditioned in the opposite direc-
tion virtually throughout history, with the first breaking away from
the ideals of conformity and submission to sacred law and authority
during the past few centuries. The real heart of modern liberalism is a
radical change: a virtual inversion in the conception of truth and be-
lieving, a transfer from a moral-religious to an intellectual-moral basis.
What the world really needs to learn from science, for handling social
problems, is not its techniques but its moral code. In the religious age,
truth was absolute and belief a matter of right and wrong, hence,
naturally to be controlled by reward and punishment. For liberalism,
truth is always provisional, and rests on the "best" evidence--inci-
dentally, not logical demonstration, but that is a long story. Right
belief was a virtue, finally the condition of eternal salvation. The
principle was stated, particularly with reference to our own religious
tradition, by Lord Bacon: "the more absurd and incredible any divine
mystery is, the greater honor we do to God in believing it" (and in
similar terms by Tertullian, around 200 A.D.). Liberal moral values
fit the same description as the liberal conception of truth; not virtue
versus vice, but the best possible at any time and place. This means that
the object of devotion and pursuit is not ends but ideals, progressively
redefined as they are progressively realized, and always with the mode


---Economics-1951-0-29.txt---
and spirit of pursuit and definition-freedom, but under critical direc-
tion not caprice-as the most essential value.
A further consequence is that liberalism is fact-facing above all. It
does not pretend that existing economic conditions are just, but recog-
nizes that justice can be approached but never attained, and freedom
likewise and any other social ideal in its ideal form. It just is not that
kind of world. It is childish if not hypocritical to preach that all dis-
cord is harmony not understood, that "in erring reason's spite, One
truth is clear, whatever is, is right," or accordingly, that omnipotent
goodness and omniscience rule the world. As T. H. Huxley said, the
ways of the cosmos are not our ways. Rather it is man's work to re-
make the world, as far and as fast as he can, according to his sentiments
and ideals about which the Cosmos gives no evidence of the least con-
cern-and to be careful not to defeat the whole project by trying to
go too far or too fast with it. Also, to enjoy what goodness and beauty
we can find, without letting these appreciations confuse and corrupt
our judgments of truth. Any of my students or former students in the
audience will please forgive me for repeating here a statement I often
quote, from Clarence Darrow, characterizing divine justice. Said he,
"God made one man a genius and the other a fool-which always
seemed to me a raw thing for God to do-to the genius." Of course,
it is a raw thing for both of them; but the world is like that, and we
must take it or leave it. Nor is much freedom possible, either, in any
social order, and notably in the large-scale organizations, efficient and
yet constantly changing, that are required to exploit modern tech-
nology. You're in the army now, even in peacetime, especially in the
mass-production industries. You can only be reasonably free to elect
some othier work, in view of the "net advantages." As to justice, other
things are distributed even less in accord with merit than wealth and
income, and we can do little against the monstrous vicissitudes and
caprices of the natural world. To secure any form of social justice,
we should have to begin with a much more equitable distribution of
parents and more remote ancestors, and manifold other circumstances
that largely determine the character of one's life long before birth.
And even when one reaches the fullest responsibility, it is possible to
have but a fraction of the knowledge necessary for really intelligent
action. As to "happiness," it is easy to agree with Darrow, and
Meredith, and many more, that the idiot or, as Whitman put it, the
animals, have the best of it. But that happiness, at least, is not what
makes human life worth while.
We must, as I have suggested, be good sports, enjoy the game
whether we win or lose, not cheat even to win, and not even be too


---Economics-1951-0-30.txt---
sore when the opponent wins by a little cheating. And we must try, all
along, gradually to improve the rules, as well as to obey and help en-
force them. The main injunctions that can be given are negative, espe-
cially not to go too fast, not to oversimplify, not to grasp at easy solu-
tions for hard problems. I think the greatest danger is that suggested by
my text-a "moralistic" approach, attributing social evil to sin, with the
implication of cure by liquidating somebody, or at least firing some
scapegoat, and seeking a savior. People are not bad, in the main, but
they are ignorant and do not understand. They have not been taught to
approach problems in terms of knowing and understanding, but to
obey some ancient rule, as interpreted by those in power, or follow
some new prophet. Democracy calls for leadership, but that does not
mean finding the right man or party and giving him or them irresponsi-
ble power. We surely know what a dictator will do, once in power; he
will, indeed, use "science" to make everyone be good and do right.
I have used up my time without saying much about the alternatives
to the free economy; but that would be an endless task, and also one
for a corps of experts. Let me repeat that how people expect to cure
the social ills by a radical shift from business to democratic politics is a
question for which I see no answer except in terms of the psychology of
romantic prejudice and screwy thinking. Most of the evils inherent in
the market organization plainly inhere still more in political cam-
paigning, legislative debates, and administration, perhaps even judicial
trials. Especially the tendency to centralization and concentration of
power-which can only go so far until voting and political discussion
will be empty forms if the boss allows them to go on at all. Yet freedom
is not enough; it was carried too far, and more and more political action
is called for, though it is dangerous; if only it can be in the main right
action, or not too far wrong! Democratic action is hard. It means
government by discussion, and the organization of discussion itself, as
I said before, involves the main problems. Not much intercommunica-
tion is even theoretically possible. As the world is built, the cards are
heavily stacked in favor of centralization. Even in one direction, com-
munication is bad enough; among economists, for instance, the typical
reply to a criticism is, "but I didn't say that." I myself have been made
a bad example for views I supposed I was arguing against all through
the years. As to inter-communication-even with two persons there is
an insoluble problem of dividing the time for both between speaking
and listening; and it is said to give rise sometimes to friction, even
causing dissolution of the holy marriage bond. With larger numbers, the
limitation increases rapidly, in I know not what form of compound
progression. One person can, indeed, be heard by a considerable num-
ber and, with mechanical aids now available, by "the world," as well


---Economics-1951-0-31.txt---
as reached by print-if so disposed. But, though no prophet, I will
predict that no invention will ever enable one to listen or attend to
more than one other at a time, or to "send" and "receive" communica-
tions at the same time.
To conclude: Time was, no doubt, when society needed to be
awakened to the possibility of remedying evils, and stirred to action,
mostly negative action, establishing freedom, but some positive action
too. Now, we have found not only that mere individual freedom is not
enough, but that its excess can have disastrous consequences. And a
reaction has set in, so that people have too much faith in positive
action, of the nature of passing laws and employing policemen, and the
opposite warning is needed. At least so I hold; perhaps it is a prejudice
-how can one tell?-I mistrust reformers. When a man or group asks
for power to do good, my impulse is to say ,"Oh, yeah, who ever wanted
power for any other reason? and what have they done when they got
it?" So, I instinctively want to cancel the last three words, leaving
simply "I want power"; that is easy to believe. And, a further con-
fession: I am reluctant to believe in doing good with power anyhow.
With William James, I incline to the side of "the slow and silent
forces," slow as in all conscience they are-and though time is fleeting.
There is much more that should be said, but certainly not on this
occasion. When I started this I knew, from experience, that I'd never
finish it. Life seems to consist of "unfinished business." And, having
already imposed on you too long, without waiting for the peremptory
order that is given to naughty corporations, I simply cease and desist.

One advantage of a presidential address is that one can appear on our
program with a topic of his own choosing. It is however, a dubious ad-
vantage. As I have proceeded with the job of program making (and I
am sure my predecessors will testify to what an arduous job it is), I
have been asked what topic I was reserving for myself. But programs
are not made in that way, and as one works on a program so extensive
as ours, he is apt to find that he has assigned about all the topics that
interest him, and that, far from having reserved anything, his question
becomes what can he possibly find to say that does not trespass too
much on others.
I have decided to make mine a kind of personal confession. I came
into economics at a later age than most, with virtually no undergradu-
ate training in it and after several years of college teaching in a dif-
ferent field. Yet I had had for some time a genuine, if quite untutored,
interest in some of the economic problems of the times, and before
entering the Graduate School I carefully scanned the catalogue. I think
I have never fully recovered from the shock of having practically all
my choices crossed out, partly on the ground that some of the things
that had seemed important to me were by then thoroughly understood
and agreed upon by professional economists-I could read about them
later-and even more on the ground that one must have a thorough in-
doctrination in "theory" before doing anything with "applied fields" or
special "problems."
I am not criticizing my advisers and, now that I am somewhat in-
doctrinated, I would probably give similar advice. This experiences


---Economics-1952-0-04.txt---
however, not only gave me a feeling of strangeness that I spent most of
my first year trying to overcome, but also set in motion a process of
wondering about the content, purposes, and methods of economic in-
quiry that has remained with me ever since. One result was that (though
I have taught it and worked in it ever since) I never did have a course
in money and banking. This was one of the fields, according to my ad-
visers, in which the theory and the problems had been pretty well
worked out and agreed upon. Looking back (it was just after the Fed-
eral Reserve System had been established, and before wartime monetary
problems-not to speak of postwar problems-had emerged), it does
appear to have been a time when old controversies had grown sterile
and most men thought they knew where they stood and found little
worth debating about. Yet we were on the threshold of a period of re-
vival of interest which has outstripped all preceding periods, and which
has I think had more effect upon economic theory and policy, including
the Keynesian "revolution" and a vast literature on the monetary as-
pects of the business cycle, than any other development of recent times.
In international trade, which has been my other main interest, I did
have a course. I was singularly fortunate to have Professor Taussig as
a teacher and guide in research, and to have as friends and fellow stu-
dents such men as Jacob Viner and Frank Graham. But in this field
also it was a relatively quiet time, and I heard frequently the com-
ment that international trade theory was the part of classical econom-
ics, more than any other, that had withstood the buffetings of time and
change and, along with its handmaiden, the gold standard, had come
down to us virtually intact and unscathed.
II
One strong impression from those days, which has remained ever
since, is the relativity of economic principles and policies to changing
conditions. Keynes remarked on the "Ricardian victory" as "due to a
complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment."' This was
surely no less true of the Keynesian victory; and since then time has
moved on again, and even the Keynesians are becoming changed men.
A fair question is how much does our thinking lead and direct, and
how much does it merely follow, the changes in environment. Very
much in the literature of economics strikes me as rationalization after
the event. This is not, however, necessarily a belittling comment, pro-
vided we know what we are doing and recognize the limitations.
The alternation of periods of comparative quiet with periods of in-
tense intellectual ferment has been characteristic of the development

---Economics-1952-0-05.txt---
of economic thought. Eighteenth-century English economic thinking
had been relatively sterile before Adam Smith, the founder of classical
economics, produced his Wealth of Nations in 1776. That book, to
which I find an increasing inclination to return in the discussion of
some of our current problems, particularly those of international eco-
nomic growth, came after a long period of decay of mercantilistic doc-
trines. The question is not whether mercantilist theory was wrong in
some absolute sense. Indeed, in our time there has been a considerable
revival of some of its ideas. But it clearly lacked a "complex of suit-
abilities" for the environment of the eighteenth century, and before
Adam Smith there had been a long period of chipping it away. Smith
had had a succession of forerunners in such men as Hume, Locke,
North, Steuart, Petty, and Cantillon; he wove together the separate
strands of thought which he had found and in the process revealed for
the first time their full significance for the modern age.
The Wealth of Nations was, preeminently, the product not only
of the man but of the times. It was the product of the great economic
changes, which through their successive phases of geographical dis-
covery, colonization, and commercial and industrial revolution, were
sweeping away old doctrines, laws, and institutions-themselves the
products of their times-and creating the modern world. This close
relation of ideas and events is of course understandable and desirable.
There appears to be a fairly well defined pattern. Times change, old
ideas are undermined, the time span depending upon the importance
and the rapidity of economic change; and on occasion, when the time
is ripe, new leaders come forward to produce their "revolutions." Such
a process is not confined to economics but has characterized every
field of human inquiry. This is not the source of my unrest. In eco-
nomics, however, there have been some features of the process which
have left with me, since graduate student days, the abiding sense of
wonder, to which I referred earlier, about the progress of our thinking,
and particularly whether we are making some progress toward doing
the leading, or are merely being led on by events which, after the fact,
we seek to rationalize into some plausible pattern.
Adam Smith has been described as a great observer, and even as a
great thinker, but not as a great theorist. Baumol's very interesting re-
cent book on Economic Dynamics2 begins with a chapter on "classical
dynamics." It makes not a single reference to Adam Smith, but gives
an excellent analysis of Ricardian economics. Yet surely Smith de-
serves a high place, and perhaps the highest, in any historical account
of dynamic economics. The point evidently is that, while Smith pro-


---Economics-1952-0-06.txt---
vided the rationale of the new expanding economy, which had already
broken its mercantilist fetters, he did not produce a consistent theory
of value and distribution. This Ricardo did, writing forty years later.
And so it has come about that Ricardo is known, not only as the
greatest exponent of classical economics, but as the real founder of
the classical "system." By the time the theory had passed through the
hands of his followers, particularly J. S. Mill, it had indeed achieved
a triumph. By the middle of the nineteenth century, most economists,
at least in Britain, undoubtedly were convinced that the basic prin-
ciples of economics had been fully worked out, though doubtless much
work would always remain for lesser minds to do in the "applied
fields."
III
It is interesting to reflect on the nature of this triumph. Ricardo
carried over intact Smith's philosophy of freedom. I think there can be
little doubt that this fact, together with Ricardo's attack on the land-
lords, was primarily the reason for the triumph. The policy implica-
tions were thoroughly in accord with that particular phase of British
economic development. Statesmen, industrialists, and merchants could
readily understand and heartily endorse them. Indeed, they had by
then long been living by these rules, and were doubtless delighted to
find that they had all along been right, and even scientific.
But few laymen could have known much about Ricardo's theory of
value and distribution, any more than most laymen today (who like
to divide us all into Keynesians and anti-Keynesians) have any un-
derstanding of the Keynesian system, but base their bias, for or against,
solely on what they conceive to be the policy implications. For me the
great paradox of classical economics is that, whereas it began with dy-
namics, providing the rationale for revolutionary economic changes, it
wound up in a tight system of static equilibrium theory, which in striv-
ing for logical consistency became increasingly remote from reality.
This I think we can ascribe mainly to Ricardo's theory of value and
distribution. Economics had taken a major turn in the road-a turn
away from Smith's causes of wealth, and a turn which I think has
mainly characterized economic theorizing ever since.
Immediately following his striking single-page first chapter, in which
he promises to reduce classical economics to the status of a special
case under his own general theory, Keynes begins his Chapter II, on
"The Postulates of Classical Economics," with the statement: "Most
treatises on the theory of Value and Production are primarily concerned
with the distribution of a given volume of employed resources between
different uses and with the conditions which, assuming the employ-
ment of this quantity of resources, determine their relative rewards


---Economics-1952-0-07.txt---
and the relative values of their products." In the accompanying foot-
note, he adds: "This is in the Ricardian tradition. For Ricardo ex-
pressly repudiated any interest in the amount of the national dividend,
as distinct from its distribution. In this he was assessing correctly the
character of his own theory." Keynes then quotes from Ricardo's letter
to Malthus: "Political Economy you think is an enquiry into the nature
and causes of wealth-I think it should be called an enquiry into the
laws which determine the division of the produce of industry amongst
the classes who concur in its formation. No law can be laid down re-
specting the quantity, but a tolerably correct one can be laid down
respecting proportions. Every day I am more satisfied that the former
enquiry is vain and delusive, and the latter only the true object of the
science."'
In earlier papers, covering a span now of over twenty years, I have
criticized the Ricardian assumptions, with special reference to the the-
ory of international trade-the given amounts of resources already
known and in use, the constant costs-and the conclusions which so
readily follow as to inherent equilibrating tendencies, mutually bene-
ficial to the trading countries. In view of the origins of classical eco-
nomics as an intellectual response to an expanding world, a world ex-
panding on a revolutionary scale, I have never been able to understand
how our thinking could have come to such a pass, and why as a gradu-
ate student my teachers should have sought to impress upon me that
this was the one part of classical economics which we could still ac-
cept as adequate, undamaged by time and change. To my mind, it was
never realistic, even for its own times, and certainly not for ours.
But as the quotations from Keynes indicate, and as Allyn Young
showed in his brilliant British presidential address in 1928 on "Increas-
ing Returns and Economic Progress,"4 the limitations of the Ricardian
kind of theorizing applied not only to international trade but to the
whole field of economic inquiry. It had ceased to be a study of growth
and had become static equilibrium analysis.
IV
Now I must make a second confession. In embarking upon Keynes'
General Theory, I was again for a few pages mystified and misled. In
view of the passages quoted above, I thought it was going to be a book
about the causes of wealth, based not on the given resources, already
known and in use, but on the forces and incentives which increase
them, and provide the growing real income and increased voluntary

---Economics-1952-0-08.txt---
leisure which in our kind of society should be the primary aims of
economic inquiry. But this book too turned out to be static economics,
with the difference-and this is what explains classical economics'
being a "special case"-that static equilibrium has now given way to
"comparative statics," and partial equilibrium analysis has now be-
come total equilibrium analysis. This latter, as it turned out, was what
Keynes meant by the quantity of resources employed, as distinct from
their distribution among uses and their relative rewards.
But surely the basic method is precisely on all fours with the classi-
cal analysis. It is again a purely logical contrivance which proceeds
from certain assumed relationships to conclusions which inexorably
follow so long as the assumptions are maintained inviolate and "other
things" remain unchanged. In its essentials, the Keynesian system,
like almost any consistent theory, is simple. Several times in the course
of the book, Keynes sums it up very well in a few sentences. To my
mind, it is a recast version of the quantity theory of money, which he
seeks to "push back toward becoming a theory of output as a whole."
He does this by converting the quantity equation into an income equa-
tion and applying concepts mainly derived from refinements on the
Marshallian k (demand for money), including as the really unique
feature of his theory, on which its whole validity depends, his "law"
of the propensity to consume. The core of the theory is his conclusion
that an advanced capitalistic society suffers from a combination of a
declining marginal propensity to consume and declining opportunities
for investment. This and other parts of the theory, such as the assump-
tion that costs and prices will remain constant or neutral as effective
demand rises to a full-employment level of income, represent the ef-
fect on Keynes of the Great Depression of the 'thirties; and it is not
to be wondered at that his American disciples, in particular, elaborated
his theory (though I think without adding anything not already there)
into the stagnation thesis. Once again, as with Ricardo, we have the
"complex of suitabilities to the environment."
One interesting point in common, as between Keynes and Ricardo,
is their attitude toward "laws." Ricardo had rejected an inquiry into
the quantity of wealth because no "law" could be laid down. Keynes'
analysis of the level of employment turns primarily on his assumed
"law" of the propensity to consume. Herein lies a real dilemma for
economic theorizing. We are constantly searching for "lawss" or "regu-
larities" or "normal" or "stable" relationships. Without them we are
reduced to what Bagehot called the "All Case" method of the German
historical school. But at the other extreme lies what he called the "One
Case" method of the British classical school. We are all too apt, seizing
upon the conditions of a particular period of time and applying the


---Economics-1952-0-09.txt---
simplifying processes of selection and emphasis to which economic the-
orizing seems all too prone, to come forth with a system of universal-
ized "laws," a system which is perhaps not implausible at its time of
origin, but which, as it becomes increasingly concerned about the con-
sistency of its internal logic, turns in upon itself, and grows more and
more remote from reality. This is precisely the sense in which Adam
Smith has come to be referred to as not a great economist, whereas
Ricardo was. And it was because Keynes presented a logical system,
based on a "law" which seemed not implausible in the conditions of
the 'thirties, that he was greeted as the founder of the "new" economics.
No one was better aware than Keynes of the need of qualifying
general principles to accord with the realities of particular situations.
His work, including also his earlier books, and particularly the Treatise
on Money, is full of passages in which he recognizes complicating cir-
cumstances which do not fit his theories. In the General Theory,
one of the best examples is his passage on mathematical economics, in
which he recognizes how much farther formal logic (and the unreali-
ties inherent in it) can be carried in symbols than in words.5 Or, again,
his chapter on prices, in which he gives five excellent reasons why costs
and prices will rise, and inflation emerge, well before his full-employ-
ment level of effective demand has been reached. No better analysis
could be desired as to why we experienced the inflationary conditions
of 1936-37 on a comparatively low level of employment; and nothing
further would be needed to explain the much more serious inflation of
the postwar period. But it was characteristic of Keynes-and this may
be inherent in the nature of economic theorizing-that after stating his
qualifications he always swept them aside as "not affecting the rigour"
of his conclusions. As he said of his qualifications about prices and
wages: "They have . . . a good deal of historical importance. But they
do not readily lend themselves to theoretical generalizations."6 So,
like Ricardo in his particular context, he swept them from his mind,
and proceeded with his theory.
But we have been living in a period of very rapid change. Sirnce the


---Economics-1952-0-10.txt---
war, we have been faced with a condition of inflation, seemingly as
intractable as the deflationary conditions which found expression in
Keynes' theory. We may still argue, as many Keynesians do, that the
income equation is still as applicable as it appeared to be in the begin-
ning. But to my mind this is either mysticism or the familiar confusion
between an identity equation and a law. It was over this same sort
of confusion that the long controversies about the quantity-of-money
equation became so sterile. Certainly, in recent years, Keynesian eco-
nomics has been undergoing fundamental changes. We have become
dissatisfied with the "law," as Keynes gave it to us. One form that this
has taken has been the further analysis of the consumption function.
It seems now agreed among econometricians that the "simple relation"
between income and consumption, as Keynes stated it, is unstable, and
in searching for a more complex relation which may have some prom-
ise of greater stability various hypotheses have been introduced which
contradict Keynes' own theory. For example, liquidity is now com-
monly accepted as a factor influencing consumption, whereas in
Keynes' theory it affected only investment. We have been working with
various hypotheses, including saving out of past income, liquid assets,
capital gains, the last highest income reached during a boom, expecta-
tions of future income, and other possible factors affecting the income-
consumption relation. The broad fact seems to be that we have nothing
left of this basic concept of the Keynesian theory other than that con-
sumption is an important component of income and deserves all the
study we can give it.7
One over-all criticism of Keynesian economics that seems to me
justified is that Keynes' emphasis on the demand side-his principle
of effective demand-sins quite as much in its taking for granted the
adaptability of supply as the classical economists did in their reverse
emphasis. This has interested me particularly in connection with prob-
lems of international trade adjustment, and how to effect the grand rec-
onciliation between internal full-employment policies and a country's
balance-of-payments position, by some method other than mere grants
of aid. But its applicability is general and the place to begin the correc-
tion would be in the internal economy, even if we were considering, as
Keynes mostly did, a closed economic system. Assuming, as Keynes did,
constant technique, and confining himself to short-period analysis,
with no analysis at all of economic processes-how we get from one
state of static equilibrium to another-Keynes' theory has always


---Economics-1952-0-11.txt---
seemed to me peculiarly inapt as a starting point for an analysis of
growth and change, and in this regard inferior to the classical theory it
was intended to supplant.
It is not surprising therefore that one major feature of contemporary
economic thinking is the attempt to dynamize the Keynesian statics.
We now have, for example, from ardent Keynesians, books with such
titles as "Towards a Dynamic Economics," which on inspection turn
out to be business-cycle theory. Here again, I must make a confession.
I had thought that while comparatively few theorists, notably Schumpe-
ter and Marx, had tried to do anything with long-run theories of
change-long-run change has been left mainly to the historians and the
statisticians-the business-cycle theorists had for half a century and
more been concerned with the dynamics of short-run change. I had not
thought it unfortunate that, as business-cycle theory developed, its
relation to classical equilibrium theory had become increasingly tenu-
ous. This seemed to me one of the major ways in which economic
thinking had been seeking to come once again in touch with the reali-
ties of economic life; and one of my main questions about Keynes had
been whether he had done economics a service or a disservice in at-
tempting to push the analysis of economic fluctuations back into an
abstract framework of equilibrium theory. As I said in my paper four
years ago, I hoped and believed that we would find ourselves bringing
back the things he temporarily submerged, the study of the processes
of short- and long-run change, the emphasis on growth and productivity,
and on price-cost-profit relationships.
Now this process is in full swing, and classes in the colleges that
earlier had dealt mainly with Keynes' General Theory are wrestling
with the business-cycle theories of Hicks, Harrod, and other leading
Keynesians. In the process, Keynesian thinking has undergone further
pronounced changes. It comes with rather a start to find men, who
probably still regard themselves as Keynesians, or as having drawn
their main inspiration from him, writing books about the economic
characteristics of an expanding economy, and to find, as is true of both
the Hicks and the Harrod versions of the cycle,8 an assumption of a
rising floor of autonomous investment. Surely this is a far cry from
the 'thirties. It is true that the language remains, and the income equa-
tion still stands, as it always must as an identity equation, but I am
not able to reconcile the assumption of a rising level of autonomous
investment, providing ever higher bottoms for depressions, and spring-
boards for bigger booms. To explain the booms, induced investment


---Economics-1952-0-12.txt---
and the acceleration principle are assigned the major role.9 To make
the transformation complete (but still presumably in the name of
Keynesian economics), Hicks leaves out money entirely, except for a
couple of supplementary chapters which he clearly regards as of very
secondary importance. What now has become of Keynes' effort "to
push back" the theory of money toward becoming a "theory of output
as a whole"? Clearly, the new environment of the postwar period has
sent us upon a new search for an acceptable "complex of suitabilities";
and Keynes' theory, as theory, is becoming rapidly submerged.
One of the most interesting aspects is the treatment of investment.
What, some of the critics are now asking, is autonomous investment?
Is there any such thing really? How distinguish between autonomous
investment and induced investment? Is there not a continuous inter-
play?10 It there any such thing as a rising rock-bottom consisting purely
of autonomous investment? And does it not seem ironic that in dynamiz-
ing Keynesian theory we find it necessary to transform his whole treat-
ment of investment, and turn it round and make it walk in the opposite
direction from that which he had assumed? In Keynes' own theory,
there was no place for induced investment. Investment was the inde-
pendent factor, tending to decline, and consumption was the induced
factor, dependent upon income, in accordance with the fundamental
law of the propensity to consume.
V
Economic theorizing seems to me pointless unless it is aimed at what
to do. All the great theorists, I think, have had policy as their central
interest, even if their policy were merely laissez faire. Keynes' greatest
virtue, I have always felt, was his interest in economic policy; and it
has been said, despite the paucity of discussion of specific policies in
the General Theory, that he started with what he regarded as the policy
requirements of the time and built his theory around them. I find this
quite understandable, and my main objection, as outlined above, is to
the pretension to universality which seems to be the inescapable bane
of theorizing.
We do not escape this bane when we turn from "general theory" to

---Economics-1952-0-13.txt---
some more limited field. I have long since ceased to be interested in the
theory of international trade; and I have long thought it naive to speak
of the theory of the business cycle. I strongly sympathize with Trevor
Swan, the Australian economist, in his recent review of Hicks' book."
Hicks begins his book in his characteristically disarming way, describ-
ing it as a "progress report," with "weak links"; but it soon becomes
apparent that his hope is that this may be thte theory of the trade cycle,
the next stage (after the theorists have approved) being "the concern
of the statisticians, econometrists, and economic historians" to do the
detailed verifying. This is a not unfamiliar division of labor suggested
by the theorists. Swan, in concluding one of the best criticisms of the
book I have seen, says: "I suspect that the search for the theory of the
trade cycle . . . is the economist's equivalent of the search for the elixir
of life or the philosopher's stone." But "each hopeless effort adds its
quota of knowledge and understanding.'2 If the truth of the trade cycle
is many, policy directed against the trade cycle must reckon not with
one, but with all its theories. Is it not time . . . to forget the glittering
prize of achieving the theory of the trade cycle, and concentrate upon
the systematic and pedestrian attempt to discover how the economy
works and grows in its parts and as a whole?""3
We do not escape the limitations of the systematizing process when
we embark on theories of long-run growth and change, as Schumpeter
and Marx have done. This, however, does seem to me the kind of
theorizing we stand most in need of, and I regret that it would go far
beyond the limits of my paper to discuss it.
I come back then to the question with which I began my paper. Are
we, through our economic policies, making headway toward doing the

---Economics-1952-0-14.txt---
leading, or are we merely the victims of our changing environment, des-
perately hanging on and seeking, after the event, to rationalize as best
we can? I have spent a good part of my life, half inside and half out-
side the university, but trying in both places to deal with questions
of economic policy. My difficulties may be due in part to an innate atti-
tude of mind, which seems always to have included a vein of skepticism,
and a desire to try to look all round a problem rather than to plunge
forthwith for the bold solution. But the real point of my paper is that,
as I think, the difficulties are largely due to the kinds of reservations
I have been making about the dependability of theory as a guide to
policy.
In any event, I cannot remember when policy questions did not pre-
sent themselves to me as dilemmas, which I would have to go outside
formal theory to try to get my bearings on, and even then would find
very heavy going. About the practical usefulness of theory, I have often
felt like the man who stammered and finally learned to say, "Peter
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers," but found it hard to work
into conversation. I will not discuss whether this attitude of mind makes
for good or bad policy making. Probably we need a mixture of minds
and temperaments and biases to function effectively. But I will say that
I think the most dangerous policy maker is the man who knows the
answer, because he feels he can take it literally from his theory.
VI
I had not meant in this paper to deal primarily with specific ques-
tions of policy, but some comments may have illustrative significance.
We are again living in a period of revolutionary economic change. In
the domestic field, I have been mainly interested in monetary and fiscal
policy. I am hopeful that the sessions on these subjects in our present
program will add to our understanding, and I hope too that the forth-
coming Patman sub-committee hearings, following on those of the
Douglas sub-committee two years ago, will throw further light on the
interrelated postwar problems of monetary control and debt manage-
ment.
But I must confess that, despite all the discussion and the accumu-
lated experience here and abroad since the First World War, this range
of problems still impresses me as being one of the great dilemmas, po-
litical as well as economic. There are few economists today who favor
unadulterated laissez faire. But about the kind and degree of interven-
tion there is endless debate. In our kind of economy-apart from war
or defense-the main emphasis has been on general monetary and fiscal
controls. But central banking in its heyday did not prevent the booms
of the 'twenties or the Great Depression of the early 'thirties. The re-


---Economics-1952-0-15.txt---
sult was a shift in emphasis toward fiscal controls. I still believe that
the first phase of this shift, which we called pump-priming, and which
involved a combination of monetary control and a cyclically unbal-
anced budget, represented, if we could have held to it, the most promis-
ing approach. But this seems to me to have been a case, par excellence,
of theory's being carried along by its own internal momentum to the
point where fiscal policy threatened to submerge monetary policy,
without having proved its own effectiveness. Deficits, instead of being
merely cyclical, became continuous; monetary policy became burdened
with the dual and conflicting r8les of stabilizing the debt as well as
stabilizing the economy, and the emphasis on the former r6le increas-
ingly overshadowed the latter. This was the kind of problem that I
felt some economists overlooked when they belittled the significance
of an internal debt on the ground that "we owe it to ourselves.""4
We can only speculate as to what the further developments might
have been but for the war. My own view was that we had had one of
the longest and greatest recoveries on record from the Great Depres-
sion, and that, though we had let it get out of hand in 1936-37 on a
still low level of employment, the new recovery from the steep but
short depression of 193 7-38 might well have carried us to a more normal
level of output and employment, and have provided the setting for a
more effective coordination of monetary and fiscal policies.
But the war greatly changed the dimensions and even the character
of the problem. By attempting to freeze the pattern of interest rates and
by allowing automatic access by banks to central bank reserves, we
found that it is not possible to freeze interest rates except in one direc-
tion, and that longer term rates fall toward the shortest and the debt
is freely monetized, as bankers and others "play the pattern." Since
the war, the great problem has been how to restore some effective de-
gree of freedom to the monetary authority to perform its role as an
economic stabilizer, with due regard also for maintaining a properly
functioning government securities market. This is the problem of mone-
tary policy and debt management. I shall not attempt to discuss it
here-it is being dealt with in two of our sessions"-except to say that
after slow progress earlier we may now be witnessing something like a
monetary renaissance, with the Treasury-Federal Reserve accord of
March 1951 unpegging the long-term rate, and with a demonstration of

---Economics-1952-0-16.txt---
the security market's ability to stand pretty much on its own feet in
December 1951-with a minimum of support through open-market
operations-and to stage a revival of rediscounting up to nearly a bil-
lion dollars, for the first time in eighteen years, and with no visible
signs of panic. These seem long steps toward a revival of a flexible in-
terest-rate policy, without which no general monetary control seems
to me possible.
One source of confusion still in our thinking is the distinction be-
tween the flexibility of interest rates and the level of rates. Many a
red herring has been drawn across this trail. When the emphasis was
greatest on fiscal policy and deficit financing in the late 'thirties, some
economists emphasized most the level of rates, and this emphasis has
persisted. One can trace it all the way from Keynes' "euthanasia of
the rentier" to some of the recent statements by the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers. Keynes changed his mind, and almost the last time I
saw him was complaining that the easy money policy had been greatly
overdone and interest rates were too low both in England and here.
When I suggested that this was being done in his name, and that he
ought to write another book, he was much amused, and said he did
think he ought to keep one jump ahead."6 What most interests me is not
the level of rates-the present level may well be the long-run average
-but the flexibility of rates. I cannot sympathize with the view that we
had better not alter rates because any upward shift might be perma-
nent, and that to avoid such a shift we should fight inflation entirely
by other means."1
Despite, however, some recent steps in the right direction, the prob-
lem of coordinating debt management and monetary control still re-
mains a dilemma. We shall be at best for some time in the pioneering
stage, working under conditions for which earlier monetary theory and
policy provide little guidance. To pose the problem as merely one of
defining spheres of jurisdiction (though that is not unimportant) is to

---Economics-1952-0-17.txt---
miss the true nature of the dilemma. It can be solved, if at all, only
through coordination of policies, covering a range that goes even be-
yond the Treasury and the Federal Reserve System. We have, I think,
made important progress from the thinking of the 'twenties, which
ran mainly in terms of controlling investment through the effects of
interest rates on borrowers, and which assumed that banks would al-
ways be "loaned up." While we should not swing to the other extreme
-the borrower will always be important-the conditions of the 'thirties,
characterized by large excess reserves and a mounting public debt,
shifted the emphasis toward the lender; and, as I said earlier, it was
under these conditions (the pump-priming phase) that we began to
appreciate the possibilities of the combination of deficits and easy
money as instruments of recovery.
A debt, however, of the present size presents new problems-prob-
lems of debt structure and of debt holding, as between bank and
non-bank investors, problems of how. to control the great institutional
investors, such as the insurance companies, while at the same time
making efficient use of them for Treasury financing, problems as be-
tween marketable and non-marketable debt, of finding proper instru-
ments of debt for small savers, problems of achieving a correct pattern
of maturities, so that the debt will not pile up unduly in the short or
long or intermediate sectors.8 All of these questions in the sphere of
debt management have a bearing on the effectiveness of monetary
control, for the less the debt is capable of self-management, the greater
becomes the need for central bank support of it, and the more mone-
tary control as an economic stabilizer becomes submerged by the con-
flicting need of supporting the government security market. Thus in-
evitably it is a dual problem rather than a problem of jurisdiction.
My mind for a long time has run chiefly on the thought that with
a large debt, widely held, small changes in interest rates could be ef-
fective in creating uncertainty, preventing the monetization of the
debt and "playing the pattern"; and that, combined with a proper fiscal
policy, such a policy of flexible interest rates could be developed into
an effective instrument of economic control. But without adequate
fiscal cooperation, the task, to say the least, would be most discourag-
ing. As experience since the war has taught us, even when the budget
is balanced, monetary control has to step aside temporarily when the

---Economics-1952-0-18.txt---
Treasury is engaged in refunding operations, and the main enmphasis
has to be placed on providing an adequate security market. It needs to
be emphasized therefore that, though we may have been making some
progress recently, we shall be facing quite a different set of circum-
stances when, as now seems most probable, the Treasury begins again to
incur substantial deficits. Shall we then be forced back into the frozen
pattern of rates, and shall we find ourselves again providing automatic
access by the banks (and others) to central bank reserves? Though we
did last year unpeg the long-term rate by the Treasury-Federal Reserve
accord, we did it largely by converting the long-term marketable debt
into non-marketable debt.'9 It remains to be seen what we shall find
ourselves doing once we get into substantial deficit financing. This is
what I meant earlier by the need for a wider coordination of policies.
The size of the budget and of the deficits depends upon Executive and
Congressional action.
VII
What seems certain is that we need a more rounded monetary-fiscal
policy, in which each part plays its proper role. The experience of other
countries as well as our own has indicated that fiscal policy by itself is
by no nmeans the cure-all that in the first flush of enthusiasm it was
thought to be. For one thing it seems highly improbable that the Con-
gress, in any country, would ever accord as great a degree of discretion
and flexibility-or could possibly-as in the monetary field. Through
the use of an increasingly progressive individual income tax and the
corporate income tax, we have achieved a substantial degree of built-in
flexibility on the revenue side of the budget; perhaps what we most
need now is a broader and more flexible use of regressive taxes (in the
form of indirect taxation) if we really want to use taxation contra-
cyclically. Since the war, we have, up to now, avoided deficits, and in
the earlier years have even had surpluses. We have moderately reduced
the federal debt, though this was partly due to the fact that we had
previotusly overborrowed for war purposes. But these achievements,
noteworthy though they are in the circumstances, have been due
mainly to the retention of taxation at virtually its wartime level and,
since Korea, to an increase in the tax burden by some fifteen billion
dollars. The level of expenditures has remained high and intractable,

---Economics-1952-0-19.txt---
despite vigorous efforts by some Congressmen in both parties to reduce
less essential or wasteful expenditure; and now, since Korea, it is
climbing back toward a level not much below that of the war period.
There is no real indication in this postwar experience that we are mak-
ing progress toward a truly contra-cyclical use of fiscal policy; though
perhaps, in view of the extraordinary circumstances of the cold war and
now rearmament, such an achievement was hardly to be expected.
One aspect of fiscal policy that I felt was underemphasized in the
discussions of the 'thirties was the dangers that may be inherent in
the growing size of the budget as distinct from its variability. Keynes,
for example, said in 1940: "It appears to be politically impossible for
a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary
to make the grand experiment which would prove my case . . . except
in war conditions."20 This point of view was widely prevalent among
American economists, who laid our failure to achieve full employment
in the 'thirties to the fact that the yearly deficits were only three or
four billion dollars instead of ten or fifteen billions. As the war drew
to a close, there was much misgiving among government economists, as
well as academic, that the reduction of expenditures from the wartime
level would recreate large-scale unemployment. Predictions to this
effect were freely made and postwar policies were based upon them,
reinforcing the inflationary tendencies that have since proved so in-
tractable. This whole experience in prediction-one of the most strik-
ing failures in the history of economics -was clearly due to the
Keynesian bias in favor of large public expenditure. It was accom-
panied by such a show of "scientific" technique, with much making of
mathematical models, projections, and regression lines (and much scoff-
ing at business men as "armchair economists") that the plain man,
though he might distrust the conclusions, could scarcely be blamed for
being bewildered and misled.
As I have indicated, the bias toward high public expenditure tends to
load the task of contra-cyclical variation onto the revenue side of the
budget. Instead of the diamond-shaped pattern of change which the
budget should have, with the two sides moving in opposite directions,
we tend to have a rising burden of taxation to counter the persistent
upward tendency of expenditures. Such a process, if long continued,
would be likely not only to undermine any true contra-cyclical budg-
etary policy but to change the character of the economy. The sheer size

---Economics-1952-0-20.txt---
of the budget raises serious questions about the viability of the economy
-its vitality, its productivity, its flexibility and adaptability-to a
far greater extent than was appreciated in the 'thirties. We tend to
accept maladjustments as a sort of force majeure which can be over-
come only by increasing doses of public intervention. The economy
becomes harder to stabilize, and budgetary policy becomes a less effec-
tive stabilizing instrument.
I have long sympathized with the thesis of Colin Clark, the Aus-
tralian economist, that a burden of taxation beyond some percentage
of the gross national product (he puts it at 25 per cent) turns upon
itself and, instead of having the deflationary effects intended, becomes
an engine of inflation, partly through pushing up wages and other
costs and thus pushing up prices to the point where the tax burden,
in real terms, has been brought back within the limits of tolerance, and
even more through undermining incentives to produce and to save. The
Cripps budget of 1948, which created a substantial surplus, was re-
garded as a miracle of austerity and self-discipline in the harsh con-
ditions confronting Britain. But there are now many British econo-
mists who question whether the losses in incentives to workers, business
men, and investors have not more than offset the deflationary effects in-
tended. There are now suggestions in Britain that the way to get more
work is to tax-exempt wages for specific kinds of work or beyond some
standard schedule of work-time. In countries like Britain and Sweden,
and even here, rising corporate taxation is accompanied by rising de-
preciation allowances which also tend to undermine the intended effect.
Even we discuss various forms of tax exemption, and make proposals
for legislation, in order to get more work, or more output of particular
kinds, or more saving (and more investment of savings in government
securities). It seems generally agreed that the British tax burden has
reached and probably passed the limits of tolerance; and it seems
more than a coincidence that the disillusionment about the big budget
is being accompanied by a return to general monetary control in Britain
and many other European countries.
As I said earlier, we clearly need a better-rounded monetary-fiscal
policy; and failing this, we should recognize that the next turn of the
road would be toward direct controls, the alternative, in the present
context of events, being more careful scrutiny as to the amount of infla-
tionary pressure the economy can tolerate. One of the main fears in
Britain today, for example, is that the rearmament program, if it
overtaxes British capacity, may result in permanently fastening upon
Britain the direct controls which since the war they have been seeking
to relax, at least internally. The American answer traditionally has
been to seek relief through increased output. In the war, we got a


---Economics-1952-0-21.txt---
wholly new vision of the expansibility of our economy. But we must
not forget that the extraordinary expansion of output in the war, though
it was an important factor in postponing inflation, did not prevent our
getting it later on. Perhaps equally impressive has been the expansion
of output since Korea, even though the defense program seems to be
lagging in some important respects. Industrial production in 1951 was
10 per cent above 1950, and 25 per cent above 1949; it surpassed
every other year except the two peak war years. Total output of goods
and services, in real terms, was larger than even in the peak war year
1944. This is all the more noteworthy, in that we embarked upon the
rearmament program from an already very high level of employment
and production, whereas at the outset of the war there was still large
unutilized capacity.
Since recovering from the initial shock of Korea, and the later Chi-
nese intervention, we have managed to maintain a precarious balance
between inflationary and deflationary forces. How long this balance
may continue will depend largely upon two factors, the size and speed
of the rearmament program, and the public behavior as to saving.
Saving, from a low point of 2.2 per cent of disposable income after taxes
in the buying panic after Korea, rose last year to about 10 per cent.
Against this anti-inflationary factor (and the further one that we may
not soon repeat the great increase in inventories that followed Korea),
we have to set the size and speed of the armament program, combined
with a continuing high volume of investment. Though I am of course
quite incompetent on the military side, it must be emphasized that
this will be our most serious economic problem, if we are not to dissi-
pate our defense effort through renewed inflation; and if this is a diffi-
cult problem for us, it is of course much more so for our Allies. We
should not rely too much on mere increase in output. Though less-
serious than a scarcity inflation, the expansion of output is an inflation-
ary process, in that incomes are paid out before goods appear in the
market; and military expansion means that incomes are paid out to
produce goods not available for civilian consumption. Unless the pro-
gram is kept within feasible bounds, or unless we can count on in-
creased saving (than which nothing is less predictable), we may find
ourselves undoing with one hand what we are trying to do with the
other, and also creating a grave prospect of recession when we come to
the period of levelling off the rearmament program.
VIII
If domestic problems raise questions about the relation of theory to
policy, this is even more the case in the international sphere. Since,
however, this paper is already long, and my paper at last year's meet-


---Economics-1952-0-22.txt---
ing was on this subject,22 my comments will be brief. Throughout its
history, international trade has played a leading role in economic
growth and change. In modern times, it has been a process of growth
from a center in which the countries outside the center have owed their
development (and often their very existence) to the movement of
factors, as well as of goods, from the center; and the center countries
have in turn owed their further development primarily to this move-
ment. Such a world was inevitably heterogeneous, with countries in
markedly different stages of development. Any theory of international
trade which does not approach the subject matter in this way must
have very serious limitations as a guide to policy. Here particularly,
we should feel the inadequacies of static equilibrium analysis.
One of the greatest paradoxes of recent times is that, while since
1914 the world has been in a state of profound and virtually continuous
disturbance, formal international trade theory has continued to empha-
size equilibrating tendencies. This has been true even of non-Keynesian
theory, but even more true of the KeyneSian type of analysis of inter-
national trade adjustment in terms of income. There has been, I think,
a tendency to run away from the actual problems by putting them
under an expansible umbrella labelled "short run" or ascribing them
to wars and periods of transition. The broad fact is that after nearly forty
years we find ourselves in a very different kind of world, with most
of the problems still remaining to be solved, and new ones continually
appearing.
Though I cannot sympathize with the tendency of theorists to throw
out everything that does not fit long-run theory under a general label
of "short run," I do feel that we have been troubled all along by two
basic problems, one of which is relatively short run and the other secu-
lar. But the main point about them is that they are interrelated in the
sense that the former would probably not exist (or recur so persistently)
but for the latter. Since the end of the First World War, much has
been said about maldistribution of reserves. This was Keynes' com-
plaint in his Tract on Monetary Reform in 1923, when he said that
the world's gold was buried in the vaults of Washington. There has
been a persistent bias toward gold absorption by this country. Owing
in large part to this bias, it has not been possible either to restore the
gold standard or to work out any other feasible international system.
The International Monetary Fund has up to now been almost wholly
inoperative, and it remains to be seen how successful will be the much
more limited exDeriment of the European Payments Union set up


---Economics-1952-0-23.txt---
under the Marshall Plan, unless some provision is made for feeding
dollars into it. The maldistribution of reserves has played a major role
in the deterioration of multilateral trade, which even before the Second
World War had become pronounced. This is a short-rtun problem only
in the sense that it has given rise to frequent short-run crises. Since the
last war, European reserves, and particularly British reserves, have dis-
played a biennial pattern, with crises in every odd year. There is some
truth in the view that if European, and particularly British, reserves
were larger, some of these storms could be ridden out. The alternative,
as experience has already shown, is further emphasis on exchange con-
trols and other discriminatory practices, and on further exchange-rate
adjustments, and, quite probably, further deterioration of multilateral
trade.23
These problems are symptomatic of deeper-seated maladjustments
arising out of long-run cumulative changes in the relative positions of
the trading countries. The great commercial revolution for which Adam
Smith provided the rationale re-made the internal economies of the
Western European countries. This was the great movement from the
center. It bestowed on those countries enormous advantages. Through
export of capital, labor, and entrepreneurship, as well as goods, they
were able to concentrate capital and labor on a small amount of land,
resulting in a population density now four times ours, in increasing
return industries and to buy the products of increasing cost industries
from abroad. But in doing so, they have become committed to a par-
ticular organization of their productive effort. As such countries lose
their initial advantages and foreign markets are cut off or seriously
reduced through the growing productivity advantages of other countries
developed in the process, it becomes increasingly difficult to find alter-
natives, either domestic or foreign. This is the basis of the urge for
European integration, which has been present under some form or
name ever since the Marshall Plan began. Whether we have been
making any headway with this problem in its long-run aspects, as
against mere reconstruction from war, still remains a much unsettled
question; and one now confused anew by the rearmament program.
Meanwhile the United States, which in earlier stages of development
absorbed European labor and capital and provided an expanding
market for European manufactures in exchange for our food and raw
materials, to our great mutual benefit, has in its later stages of develop-
ment presented a growing threat of chronic world imbalance. Occupy-

---Economics-1952-0-24.txt---
ing a great and diversified land area, the United States has developed
a rounded economy, marked by rapid technological progress, on a scale
never previously witnessed. It produces over 40 per cent of the world's
manufactures, but still relies predominantly on home supplies of food
and raw materials. Over the last hundred years, our imports have de-
clined from about 10 per cent to less than 5 per cent of our national
income, compared with percentages of 10 to 30 or higher for Western
European countries. Since the 1870's, the composition of our foreign
trade has undergone pronounced changes, with imports of manufactures
showing a large relative decline and exports of manufactures a large
increase (from about one-seventh of our exports to about one-half).
In the process, the share of Europe in our trade has undergone a
marked secular decline, and the pattern of our trade has shifted toward
the non-European world. Though the wars have undoubtedly accentu-
ated these changes, they were already apparent before 1914. They
raise a question whether Western Europe, if much more vigorous meas-
ures toward increasing productivity are not taken (and it must be re-
membered that increasing productivity is a race-this country cannot
be expected to stand still), is not in danger of being pushed into a back-
water.
Meanwhile a great change appears to be under way in the relation
of industrial production and trade to foods and raw materials. For
perhaps three-quarters of a century, the problem had been whether
the industrial countries could absorb the food and raw materials which
they had been instrumental in developing in other countries, on terms
of trade tolerable to the latter. Now the imbalance appears to be swing-
ing the other way. Owing partly to the expansion of industrial output
in Europe under the Marshall Plan, and even more to our own absorp-
tion of raw materials (in the consumer durable goods industries as well
as in the capital goods industries), there is a general world problem of
availability of supplies. Again, this problem has been much accentuated
by the rearmament program; but it was becoming apparent even before
Korea. World industrial production since 1938 has grown by some 50
per cent, while the output of food and raw materials has at most in-
creased by 10 per cent. Some experts have estimated that, apart from
the United States, the world's food production is now lower than before
the war; and if we take out a few items, such as petroleum and alumi-
num, this may well be true also of the raw materials.
This problem of the changing balance in production points up the
need, on the economic side, of an effective program for the under-
developed countries. It comes, however, at a time when sharply diver-
gent views are developed as to the purposes of international investment
(or grants). The less developed countries, with their recently won


---Economics-1952-0-25.txt---
sovereignty and their growing social welfare consciousness, often do not
welcome the nineteenth-century kind of foreign investment, which they
regard as "exploitation," a process of extraction at low cost of what the
industrial countries wanted, while doing little or nothing toward creat-
ing a better rounded economy and a better scale of living. Thus, the
urge for a mixed economy collides with the world need for primary pro-
duction. Moreover, the number of countries is limited from which good
results could be expected from any large-scale program of investment.
Probably what we need in many countries is pilot experiments, such as
the International Bank might undertake (and has already); and in
any event any general investment program would have to be planned or
controlled by governments, not only because private capital is still
timid (after the mistakes of the 'twenties) but because we would not
otherwise know how the parts might fit together.
These are surely not short-run problems. Nor are they problems for
which good policy answers can be derived from formal theory.
IX
As I look back over my paper, I have some misgivings. The discus-
sion of current problems has taken more space than I intended, and it
may well be a mistake to try to cover such large areas of policy in what
can at best be only thumb-nail sketches. It may well be too that some
readers wlho might not be unsympathetic to the general thesis of this
paper, and might want to join me in some of my confessions, may fall
out with me when it comes to the specific policies. For I have often
felt that, whether we agree or disagree in our formal theorizing, it is
when we come to policy making that we really find out how we stand.
But in any case, I did feel the need of attempting some kind of illustra-
tion of what I was driving at in the earlier portions of the paper.
Now that I have somewhat eased my mind of some things that have
long been on it about economic theory and method and the purposes of
economic inquiry, I should like somewhat to smooth the troubled waters
-though I do hope I have troubled them. If any theorist takes my
remarks too much to heart, I can only say that I never get much beyond
being in a quandary. As Keynes said, without theory we are "lost in
the woods." We must of course have hypotheses for testing. But it is a
close question whether it is any worse to be lost in the woods than in
one's theory, pursuing its internal consistency to the point where con-
tact with reality is lost. This, I think, is the biggest of all our dilemmas,
and there may be no escape from it. I do not pretend to have provided
an answer; but it should do us no harm to be aware of the limitations
under which we work.
