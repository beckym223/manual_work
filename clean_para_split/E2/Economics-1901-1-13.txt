of them as never before.
There is, llloreover, a growing belief in the effieaey
of professional ecltleation and speeial training as a
valuable or indispensable elen-zent in the preparation of
the young lllan for l-lis ftlture ealling. A eentllry ago

more deEnite way, as to the present and future poliey,
and submit the result to your eonsideration.
I beliexe the Auleriean university ought to take the
