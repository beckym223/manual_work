to plOlllOte libert)r. Necessarily, social action
which determil-les or ret,ulates in an) way the relations
of men among themselves, must restrict freecloll-l of
movement at some point, but where it is wise it increases
it more than correspondingly at other points. If
we have restriction upon liberty called 2a) xve have in
the ca.se of wise, social action all inclement of liberty

their fellows fol- then- own benefit.
We thus have a vast body of legislation in and
through which society seeks liberty. This legislation
uoclifies and qualifies nominally free contract, because
nominally free contract may mean servitude of various
kinds anci various degrees. The aim is the increase of
liberty in the positive sense.

Education is one of the liloes along which modern

powers and aids us in adjusting ourselves in the relations
of cozlplex economic society.

Mocleroll legislation eveol reluctantly and against the
force of prejudice, recognizes increasillglv the existence
of classes, and the inequalities of powers amotlgllunlan

children, for rhol-n re have special laws. AVomell are
another great class, with a nature different from that of
