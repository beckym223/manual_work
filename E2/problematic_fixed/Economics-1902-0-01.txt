The year I776 iS an epocll-lllakint, date in the history
of liberty. Every American associates I776 with the
lDeclaration of Independence, svl-liell, however we may
look upon it-and all Inoclerr-l criticisr-n just and unjust,
to the contrary, notwithstanding ranks among the
greatest and glallclest clocalIlellts of the world's history.
It is there asserted, a.s sometllillZ axiolllatic, as something
lJelonging to the realm of natural lasr, that lil:erty
is an illaliellable rit,-llt of all men. You all recall
the precise words: " We hold these truths to be
self-eviclent; that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their Creator With certain ullalienal)le
Rit l-lts, that among these are L;fe, LilDerty and the pursuit
of ISappiness." It is flortllerlrlore asserted tl-at the
rery purpose of the institution vf oOVerNlnellt iS to
secure these riglltEs, and that evely gorrernllletlt clerines
its just powers from the consent of the t,overned.
But the year I776 witnessed the appeara:ace of a book
W}liCll SO admirably presented the eighteenth century
philosophy of industrial llbel-ty, that by colllxnon COI1-
selit of the illtelligenl: it ralll.s among the work-l's
greate.st books. I refel- to Adam Slrlitll's " Wealth oÂ£
Nations ", which oWcupies a pivotal oSitiOll in Modern
economic thought, earlier works preparing the way for
this lnaster-piece, and subsequent works in economics
resting tIpon the " Wealth of Nations" as a foundation.
So profound has been its inrSuence that the centennial
of its appearance was cleellleci worthy of a celebration.
