One is the progressive eharaeter of the state,
^.1. to general ellliglltenment; another is the altrllistie
.pxrit of the age, wliiell finds suell oSratifyillg expressio
the Old Bay state, and a third is the faet of its lligl
dustrial development, as a result of wllicll it has llad
3 r deal for a longer period than other states ritll those
questions growilag out of an intelasive industrial life.
Reeently, howeer, to states, viz., Tenlaessee ala(t West
Virginia, itldustriallwr far less developed, have taken a
leadillg po.sition in the regulatioll of eontraet in the
itlterests of libertz trtlly eoneeived. I refer to the
deeisions of the eourts of these states, sustaining statutes
prohibiting the lnaintellallee of trllek sllops, and also
providitlg for weigllillg of eoal. the eourts elearly
reeognize inequalities in baraainillg porer, 157ilag baek
of eontraet, and they also take the pOSitiOzz,-ancR it is undoubtedly
a true one,-that wise legislatiotl of this sort is
ealeulated to prevent industrial strife, disorder and
bloodshed, and to maintain the publie peaee.l
The au,ust tribunal whieh holds its sessioll in this
eity, the Suprellle Court of the United States, has also,
OI1 broad grounds of publie policy, 1lplleld the statute of
the state of Utall, wllieh limits the x^Torking day Â£or
mitlers in that state to eight hours.2 TIle Supreme
Court did not go into the wisdotll of this partietllar
statute, and I have no desire to clo so ola this oceasiool.
It is silnply the broad prineiple of regulation of eeollomie
relations in the interests of freeclolll rhicll is in
question. We see the most enlightelled eourts thus enmists
and sociologists are the people to sTholll sve otlght to turIl more
thala ve do for illstruction irl the groullds and foutldatioIls of all
ratiollal decisions."
