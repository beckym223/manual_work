opinion to bolster up this demand for the retention and
strengthenillg of the right kind of competition. In
alltiquity political and social opinion was a class
opinion. In the middle ages the incoherent public
opinion was intolerant to competition. In modern
titnes the progress of econotnic thought and the pressure
of econonaic fact in uplifting the hitherto submerged
classes of the community are generating a public
opinion which frankly recognizes the benefits of a
healtlly coznpetitioll, but which insists more and more
on effective social control of competition to the end that
it be elevated and purified.
This is the true uleaning of the sixth point of difference,
the flower and the fruit of all its forerunners, the
existence of the democratic ideal. We pOillt, indeed, with
cotllplacency to the advance made by the working classes,
but to those who realize the essential conclitions of successful
clemocracy, where the mass of citizens are necessarilwT
the laborers, the ideal to be attained advances still
ulore quickly than tl-le actual progress. The brutish,
lethargic peasant of the old world is content witl-l his
crust anci his misery. The free citizen of our industrial
dezzlocracy wants, and wants justly, to participate in the
spiritual as well as the material benefits of tnodern civilization.
With every advance in his econoznic position,
due to the interplay of modern industrial forces, new
vistas of possibilities discloce tllemselves, new sources
of legitimate satisfaction make their appearance. The
social unrest of to-day, with all its disquieting and deplorable
incidents, is on the whole a salutary symptom.
It is bllt the labor-pains in the birth of the new industrial
order which has been in the making for the past few
generations, and of which the faint outlines are even now
discernible.
