government. Furthermore, the problem of liberty is
only to a minol extent a political prol:)lelll. And as it
is only to a lrlinor extent a politieal problem, it can
llesler, in any true sense, lJe secured by a mere repeal of
political laws, nor indeed bl a mere enactment of
political lal.N7s. Neither removal of politico-eeonoulic
restrictions upon freedom of trade, nor enactment of
ulliv7ersal suffrage, can give us more than a smal], fractional
part of liberty.

Our OaTu, familiar, everyday experience teaches t1S that
reStriCtiOIlS upon our positive liberty of action are mainly
due to the coerciool of economic forees. T1lis coercion
of ecol-lomic forces manifests itself in many ways, but
largely in and through contract competitively formed.
This is seen, -first of all, in what may be called the problessg
of the tzevessSieSA vn^z. Nineteen men wish to pursue
a certain course of economic aetioll, but are coerced
comptitively by the twentieth into a line of conduct
N71aicll they dislil e. Nineteen barbers in the city of Madison,
WiSCOl]Sill, vislaed to close their shops on Sunday;
the twentieth would not agree to close his, and consequently,
all tlge twenty were, and still are, kept open.
Nineteen men may desire to work ten hours a day, and
mal be coerced by the twentieth into xrorlzing fourteen
hours a day. Apparently they are all working fourteen
hours a day because they choose to do so, but the choice
is not a free one, in any true .Sense of the word. Even
the tarentietll ollan prefers to work ten hours a clay, but
yields to pressure for the sake of a temporary advantage,
and so he is likewise coereed. The freedom -wizieh thus
expresses itself in eontraet is in eertain eases lilSe the
freedom of a slave, who chooses to work rather than to
suffer under the lash.

The coercion of economic forces is largely due to the
