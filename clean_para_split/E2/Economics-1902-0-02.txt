Placillg it below the Declaratiotl of Illdepenclellce iIl its
power over lltllllall clestinies, laevel-tlleless, I clare to
place it in the first rank of ?ublication.s which deal
with l-ltlnlall liberts.
The spirit of the age in arllicll he wrote bl-eatlles
thl-olloll Aclam Stnitll's " XVealtll of i%RtiOllS 2. this
spirit is a world-spirit, atod the a<>e is coslrlopolitan.
This spirit fizlcls its nlost logical, its clearest and fllllest
