probletus two thousand years ago. But I have faith to
believe that this is not the fate marked out for us to-day.
I believe that the Alzlericall people and the modern civilized
world in general will solve these probletus, as they
have solved other problems which have come up iul the
successive phases of their history; that we shall meet
the new collective 1leecls of industry and government
with a true collectivisIn of spirit and purpose. Not
with that superEcial collectivism or socialism which,
like the individualism that it strives to supersede, often
allalces too much of mere political machinery, and believes
that mel] are to be saved by their institutions
rather than their characters; but with a public spirit
which demands, as a part of the national ethics, that
men shall shape their course on the basis of conviction
rather than of compromise, and that public discussion
shall look toward a commoIl understanding rather than
a bargain. Because the political aled colllonercial Methods
of the past have led to compromise rather than conviction,
or because the successful man of affairs must be
read^T to compromise where he fails to convince, let us
not say that all politics and all commerce is but a tissue
of compromises, and that a political or commercial
science which pretends to be something broader and
better than this, is all illusion. Let us as economists
take the opportunity that lies lDefore us, in the face of
new conditions for whose treatment the old methods are
plOVillg themselves inadequate. Let us employ our Ullw
derstallding with regard to public needs as a means of
evoking public spirit. Let us use whatever special
knowledge we have with all the breadth of purpose
which it is in our power to attain, aold make ourselves,
as becomes men of science, representatives of nothing
less than the whole truth.
