llberty means the explessioIl of positixTe pORVelS of the
illdiViClllal, allcl that it Call be reaclled only cls a result
of a long ancl tstrclllous collstrtlctive process. Green tells
zIS in these xrorcls what he lneatls by li4erty orfreeclotn:
" We do not llleall onerelv fleecloll-l from restraint or
comptllsioll. 5Ale clo not lizeaxl lllerel fl-eeclozn to do as
we like irrespectivrely of what it is that we like. We
do not llleall a freec10on that cAn be elljoaTed by one lllan,
or orle set of tnell, at the cost of a loss of freedom to
others. When we speak of freedoul as somethillt,- to be

Ais anal-clar gives 11s tl-le logical outcollle of one line
of thought concerllint, liberty, so we find another line
of ttzollgllt, regarclillg libert, going far beyond the
necessary iz;-lzlications of Green's pOSitiOIl and terlMinatillg
