3. If you vould have entered this University in any case, svhat
course would you have taken if the School of Commerce had 1lot beela
established ?

I received replies from every one of the students, +^Tith results as
follo+^rs:

Twenty-sis reply that they would not have elltered this or any
other university had not the School of Comulerce been established.
They would have gone instead directly into btlsiness. Three are Ullcertain,
but state that they zTould have probably taken a special
course in sozne college or university, selectillg such studies as xvould,
in theil- OpilliOIl, best prelDare thenl for business. Of the remainder,
24 xvould have entel-ed our College of Letters and Science, g the Civic
Historical cotlrse, 8 the General Science course, 5 the Englisil course,
2 the Moclern Classical course. O-f the remainder, 6 +^rould have en
tered the Engineering School, 4 the Law School, and 2 the College of
Agriculture. I interviewed the I2 last melltiolled students, and discovered
that in every case they srould have taken the Engilleerillgy
the Iva+r, or the Agricultural course, not because they wished to make
themselves engineers, lamryers or farmers, but because in the opinion
of themselves or their fathers, these courses furnished a better preparation
for business than the courses in the College of Letters and
Science.

It seetns to me that these statistics indicate very clearly the need for
Schools of Commerce. At any rate, +^re are satisfied that in the astablishment
of the School we have reached a new constituency which has
not been previously attracted by our University courses."
