to call repl-esentatives of different parts of the people
together for the authoritative presentation of popular
OpilliO. At the close of the last century, when other
countries adopted institutions modeled on the Eaglish
Parliament, it was intended that they should preserve
this same function as del:)ating bodies; and the most
glorious pag-es in the history of the United States Congress,

geographical sections to get something wider than the
local view point, and to see what was the general sentiment

In the course of the presel-lt century our representative
assemblies have ceased to be places for debate.
The extension of the telegrap1ll and the postal service

and congresses hase become bodies for the making
of laws rather than for the zzlaking of opinions.
That this change has been accompanied by a loss in
sallltary influence of legislative bodies is, I think, unquestionable.
No longer do the membel-s strive to impress
their several convictions on the whole body of
which they form a part; they strive rather to form a
