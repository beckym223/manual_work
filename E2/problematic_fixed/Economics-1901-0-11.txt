Let lne offer an illustration. To-clay the
civil service of the modern nation fllrllislles all opportzlIlity
for a livelihood to a considerable percelltat,e of
tl-le population. Competition for admission to the civil

differences in results. On the one llallel, the extension
of competition lessells bitterness, because it is luore in

law of competition in its purest form. The prevailing
idea, llosrever, that it is tl-le fittest possible that survive
