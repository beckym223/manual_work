tendelley sllos^rs itself in eonneetioll with state legisÂ°
latures, whose sessions are now being made less frequent,
and whose sphere of action when they do meet is
lDeing narrowed by eonstitlltiolls and other instruments
providing for a referellee of all more important lars to
the people direet. {t is l]ot neeessary for the purpose
of this argument to say whetl-ler this ehallge be ala improvement
or not; it is at any rate a signifieallt sibn of
the trend of the times. The abanclotSllllent of the duty

we had it twenty-fi\, e years ago, without disastrous
fluetuations in priee and the danger of eommel-eial
erises due to irregulal- investments of eapital. All these
facts are so familiar at the resent day that it is useless
to enlarge upon them. Business has beeome a trust, in
